table of contents overview we provide securities brokerage and clearing execution services to our clients 
our principal operating subsidiaries consist of introducing broker dealer operating units and our wholly owned securities clearing broker dealers  ameritrade  inc and iclearing llc iclearing 
during fiscal  substantially all of our net revenues were derived from our brokerage activities and clearing and execution services 
our primary focus is serving retail clients by providing services at prices that are generally lower than most of our major competitors 
our brokerage clients are able to trade securities with us through a variety of channels  principally the internet 
we provide our clients with investment news and information as well as educational services 
we also provide clearing and execution services to our brokerage operations as well as to unaffiliated broker dealers 
our largest sources of revenue are commissions earned from our brokerage activities and associated securities transaction clearing fees 
our other principal source of revenue is net interest revenue 
net interest revenue is the difference between interest revenues and client interest expense 
interest revenues are generated by charges to clients on margin balances maintained in brokerage accounts and the investment of cash from operations and cash segregated in compliance with federal regulations in short term marketable securities 
client interest expense consists of amounts paid or payable to clients based on credit balances maintained in brokerage accounts 
we also receive payment for order flow  which results from arrangements we have with many execution agents to receive cash payments in exchange for routing trade orders to these firms for execution and is included in commissions and clearing fees on the statement of operations 
our largest operating expense generally is employee compensation and benefits 
employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries  bonuses  group insurance  contributions to benefit programs  recruitment and other related employee costs 
communications expense includes telecommunications  postage  news and quote costs 
occupancy and equipment costs include the costs of leasing and maintaining our office spaces and the lease expenses on computer and other equipment 
depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on property and equipment  as well as amortization of intangible assets 
professional services expense includes costs paid to outside firms for assistance with legal  accounting  technology  marketing and general management issues 
interest on borrowings consists of interest expense on our convertible subordinated notes and other borrowings 
other operating expenses include commissions and clearance expenses  trade execution fees  provision for losses  client execution price adjustments  travel expenses and other miscellaneous expenses 
in addition  our costs related to the processing of client confirmations  statements and other communications are included in this category 
advertising costs are expensed as incurred and include production and placement of advertisements in various media  including online  television  print and direct mail 
advertising expenses may increase or decrease significantly from period to period 
we believe that the online securities brokerage market is currently impacted by four significant trends that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 
first  commissions charged to clients of online brokerages have stabilized and begun to increase slightly over the past two years  after decreases over the past several years 
second  technology has increased in importance  as delivery channels such as the internet have become more prevalent 
the vast majority of our trades are now placed through electronic media  primarily the internet 
this increased use of electronic media has helped to decrease operating expenses per trade over the past several years and we believe this trend will continue 
third  the effects of price competition and required investment in technology have resulted in some consolidation in the industry 
finally  we believe the intense advertising and promotional efforts by our major competitors and us are making it increasingly difficult for new entrants to make a competitive impact without substantial financial resources to invest in building a brand 
our fiscal year ends on the last friday in september 
references to fiscal year in this document or in the information incorporated herein by reference are to the approximate twelve month period ended on any such friday 
for example  fiscal refers to the fiscal year ended september  business combination on september   we completed our merger with datek 
pursuant to the merger agreement  ameritrade online holdings corp 
aoh formerly ameritrade holding corporation and datek each 
table of contents became wholly owned subsidiaries of a newly formed holding company  which was renamed ameritrade holding corporation 
upon the closing of the transaction  stockholders of aoh and datek each received shares of a single class of common stock of the new holding company  with the stockholders of aoh and the stockholders of datek each receiving approximately percent of the total outstanding common stock 
in connection with the transaction  the board of directors of the new holding company will consist of nine members  including three directors designated by the principal stockholders of aoh  three directors designated by the principal stockholders of datek and three independent directors to be selected with the agreement of the principal stockholders of aoh and the principal stockholders of datek 
currently eight of the nine board seats have been filled  with one remaining independent director to be named 
we are currently in the process of integrating datek s business with ours 
as part of the integration planning process  we have formed an integration planning organization comprised of representatives of both companies and a former datek stockholder 
integration planning teams were assigned to determine the product and service features  functionality for clearing settlement services  call center organization and services  technology platforms and order routing for the combined company 
website enhancements to both our and datek s front end websites  along with a new pricing schedule  were implemented on october  several months after the completion of the merger  we intend to phase in a combined website  which will be a single point of entry on to the trading platform for both ameritrade and datek clients 
during fiscal  we plan to consolidate the clearing functions performed by ameritrade and datek using the ameritrade  inc clearing platform 
datek s client call center function was moved to call centers in omaha  nebraska and ft 
worth  texas shortly after completion of the merger 
the integration plans for the operations of ameritrade and datek are subject to change 
we anticipate synergies from the merger resulting from cost savings programs  estimated to be approximately million on an annualized  after tax basis and which are expected to result from downsizing the workforce  resulting in estimated annualized after tax savings of approximately million  eliminating duplicate occupancy  equipment and depreciation expenses  resulting in estimated annualized after tax savings of approximately million  and eliminating duplicate advertising  communication  professional fees and other expenses  resulting in estimated annualized after tax savings of approximately million 
results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net revenues commissions and clearing fees decreased six percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of securities transactions processed  as average trades per day decreased percent to  in fiscal from  in fiscal clients averaged approximately trades per account during fiscal  compared to approximately trades per account during fiscal the decreased volume per account was partially offset by a significant increase in client accounts 
we added  core accounts during the fourth quarter of fiscal through our acquisition of national discount brokers corporation ndb and  core accounts during the fourth quarter of fiscal through our merger with datek 
the substantial advertising expenditures made by us during the past few years also contributed to account growth 
client accounts increased to approximately  at september  from approximately  at september  commissions and clearing fees per trade increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase was due primarily to the addition of the ndb accounts  which became part of our ameritrade plus product offering  the implementation of a commission structure for our freetrade product offering effective february  for trades in excess of per month and increased option trading by our clients  which generates higher commissions than equity trades 
these increases were partially offset by slightly lower payment for order flow revenues 

table of contents on september   we announced a new suite of products and services that went into effect  along with a new pricing schedule  on october  under the new pricing schedule  commissions for online equity trades are for both market and limit orders  regardless of the number of shares bought or sold with no additional order handling fees 
under the previous pricing schedule  commissions for online equity market orders were  while online equity limit orders were 
flat commission pricing has also been implemented for interactive voice response system trades  at per trade previously for market orders and for limit orders 
broker assisted trades are now for market orders  with an additional fee for limit orders 
we expect the net effect of the new pricing schedule to result in an increase of approximately percent in commissions and clearing fees per trade during fiscal the incremental increase in revenue per trade is expected to be offset somewhat by slightly higher account attrition in the months following the implementation of the new pricing schedule 
in august  nasd directed our broker dealer subsidiaries  iclearing and ameritrade  inc  to cease permitting specified trading in cash accounts that nasd believes violates regulation t of the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
we are currently in the process of evaluating  designing  testing and implementing necessary changes to our systems and procedures to address the nasd restriction 
we expect that this restriction on specified trades will result in a decrease in trading activity in some cash accounts  some clients closing their cash accounts  some clients converting to margin accounts and a potential increase in trading activity in some margin accounts 
we cannot predict with any degree of certainty the impact of this restriction on our revenues and profitability because we cannot adequately forecast the degree to which clients that have engaged in specified trades will adjust their trading activity  close cash accounts or convert to margin accounts  nor can we predict the impact of future prevailing market conditions and other factors over which we have no control 
although its impact is dependent on many factors that we cannot predict  we believe that this restriction on specified trades could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
see risk factors implementation of nasd s position concerning permissible activity in cash accounts will restrict some trading activities of some of our clients and harm our business below 
net interest revenue interest revenue less client interest expense decreased percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to a percent decrease in average client and correspondent receivables  a decrease of approximately basis points in the average interest rate charged on such receivables  a decrease of approximately basis points in the average interest rate earned on cash and investments  including cash and investments segregated in compliance with federal regulations  and an increase of percent in average amounts payable to clients and correspondents in fiscal from fiscal these factors were partially offset by an percent increase in average cash and investments  including cash and investments segregated in compliance with federal regulations  and a decrease of approximately basis points in the average interest rate paid on client and correspondent payables in fiscal from fiscal we generally expect net interest revenue to grow as our account base grows  however  it will also be affected significantly by changes in interest rates and fluctuations in the levels of client margin borrowing and deposits 
other revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due primarily to increased money market fee income  and the implementation during the second half of fiscal of a transaction fee for paper confirmations and a quarterly fee on accounts that do not meet certain minimum levels of trading activity or assets 
in addition  fees charged to third party broker dealers for orders placed through the tradecast licensed order entry software system also contributed to the increase 
we acquired tradecast effective april  on september   we announced our decision to pursue a sale of tradecast  due to redundancies with datek s technology 
once the disposal of tradecast is completed  it is expected to result in approximately million in annualized operating cash flow savings 
expenses excluding client interest employee compensation and benefits expense decreased eight percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due primarily to the effect of staff reductions during fiscal although full time equivalent employees increased to  at the end of september from  at the end of september primarily as a result of the datek merger  the average number of full time equivalent 
table of contents employees was percent lower in fiscal than fiscal we expect the number of employees to decrease during the first half of fiscal as the datek merger integration progresses 
communications expense decreased percent to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  due primarily to decreased expense for quotes  market information and postage due to lower transaction processing volumes and the implementation of electronic trade confirmations and client statements during fiscal  partially offset by additional communications expenses for tradecast 
occupancy and equipment costs decreased nine percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to the effect of our facilities consolidation and related restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal  partially offset by additional occupancy and equipment costs related to tradecast 
depreciation and amortization decreased percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due primarily to the discontinuation of goodwill amortization upon our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on september   and the effect of the facilities consolidation and resulting restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal  partly offset by higher software amortization expense 
professional services expense decreased percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to decreased usage of marketing and technology consulting services during fiscal compared to fiscal  partially offset by legal and accounting expenses incurred in connection with the datek merger in fiscal interest on borrowings decreased percent to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal  due to the conversion of million of convertible subordinated notes in february and lower average interest rates and borrowings on our revolving credit agreements 
the debt conversion resulted in savings of approximately million annually in cash interest payments on the convertible subordinated notes 
other operating expenses increased six percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to the accrual in fiscal of million related to a patent infringement matter  partially offset by lower transaction processing volumes and the implementation of electronic statements and trade confirmations in fiscal advertising expenses decreased percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the reduced level of advertising expenditures was principally due to adverse stock market conditions and lower media costs 
we expect to spend approximately to million for advertising for fiscal  depending on market conditions 
gain on sale of investment in fiscal consists of a gain of approximately million on the sale of preferred stock of epoch partners  inc epoch 
we sold our interest in epoch for approximately million in cash 
restructuring and asset impairment charges in fiscal consisted of a million impairment charge to reflect the amount by which the carrying value of the tradecast subsidiaries exceeded its estimated fair value 
the impairment loss consisted of million of goodwill and million of property and equipment 
restructuring and asset impairment charges of million in fiscal consisted primarily of severance pay and benefits for approximately terminated employees and impairment charges related to a comprehensive facilities consolidation in connection with a reorganization of our corporate and management structure 
offices in fort worth  texas  omaha  nebraska  baltimore  maryland  and purchase  new york were affected by the facilities consolidation 
debt conversion expense in fiscal consisted of million of cash paid to holders of the convertible subordinated notes in connection with the conversion of million of the notes into million shares of class a common stock  and million of deferred note origination costs written off related to the converted notes 

table of contents income tax expense was million in fiscal compared to income tax benefit of million in fiscal we recorded income tax expense in fiscal despite having a pretax loss before income taxes  due primarily to the nondeductible goodwill component of the tradecast impairment charge 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net revenues commissions and clearing fees decreased percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to an percent decrease in commissions and clearing fees per trade to for fiscal from for fiscal  and an percent decrease in the average number of trades processed per day to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decrease in commissions per trade was due primarily to our clients increasingly using the internet to place trades  as we charge lower commissions for internet trades than for trades placed through other means  growth in our freetrade 
com tm client base  a lower commission structure for option trades and lower payment for order flow revenue per trade 
payment for order flow revenue per trade decreased due primarily to regulatory changes  including stock market decimalization 
the decrease in transaction processing volume was primarily a result of significantly lower client trading activity during fiscal  compared to unusually high client trading activity throughout much of fiscal clients averaged approximately trades per account during fiscal  compared to approximately trades per account during fiscal in addition  there were fewer trading days during fiscal than fiscal due to fiscal being a week fiscal year and four days of market closures in fiscal due to the september terrorist attacks 
the decreased volume per account was partially offset by a significant increase in client accounts resulting primarily from the substantial advertising expenditures made by us during the past few years  and  core accounts added through our acquisition of ndb 
client accounts increased to approximately  at september   from approximately  at september  net interest revenue decreased percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to a decrease of percent in average client and correspondent receivables and a decrease of approximately basis points in the average interest rate charged on client and correspondent receivables  partially offset by a percent increase in average cash and investments  including cash and investments segregated in compliance with federal regulations  in fiscal compared to fiscal other revenues increased percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due primarily to the implementation of a per quarter fee during the third quarter of fiscal on accounts that do not meet certain minimum levels of trading activity or assets 
in addition  fees charged to third party broker dealers for orders placed through the tradecast licensed order entry software system also contributed to the increase 
expenses excluding client interest employee compensation and benefits expense was virtually unchanged at million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal full time equivalent employees decreased percent to  at the end of fiscal from  at the end of fiscal reductions in expense resulting from staff reductions during fiscal were largely offset by costs associated with the hiring of our new chief executive officer during the second quarter of fiscal communications expense increased percent to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  primarily due to higher quote and market information costs and additional communication expenses for tradecast 
occupancy and equipment costs increased percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to the lease of equipment and additional office space 
in fiscal  we added approximately  square feet of additional space in baltimore  maryland  ft 
worth  texas  omaha  nebraska  chicago  illinois  and american fork  utah 
we also leased additional equipment during fiscal occupancy and equipment costs in houston  texas related to tradecast also contributed to the increase 

table of contents depreciation and amortization increased percent to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal  due primarily to depreciation on additional equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements added during fiscal to accommodate growth and additional goodwill amortization resulting from the tradecast acquisition 
professional services expense decreased percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to higher usage of marketing and technology consulting services during the first half of fiscal  including consulting costs related to the development of onmoney 
com 
interest on borrowings decreased percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due to lower average interest rates and the conversion of million of convertible subordinated notes to class a common stock in february other operating expenses decreased percent to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  primarily due to the effect of lower transaction processing volumes 
advertising expenses decreased percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the continuing high level of advertising expenditures was principally related to our efforts to build and maintain awareness of the ameritrade brand and was primarily responsible for the significant increase in the number of client accounts during the period 
however  due to adverse stock market conditions and a historically slow market for new accounts during the summer  we reduced our advertising expenditures during the second half of fiscal gain on sale of investment consists of a gain of approximately million on the sale of our preferred stock of epoch during fiscal we sold our interest in epoch for approximately million in cash 
restructuring and asset impairment charges of million in fiscal consisted primarily of severance pay and benefits for approximately terminated employees and impairment charges related to a comprehensive facilities consolidation in connection with a reorganization of our corporate and management structure 
offices in fort worth  texas  omaha  nebraska  baltimore  maryland  and purchase  new york were affected by the facilities consolidation 
we recorded asset impairment charges of million during fiscal related to specific software applications that were discontinued 
debt conversion expense in fiscal consisted of million of cash paid to holders of the convertible subordinated notes in connection with the conversion of million of the notes into million shares of class a common stock  and million of deferred note origination costs written off related to the converted notes 
income tax benefit was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the effective income tax rate in fiscal increased to percent compared to percent in fiscal  due in part to the effect of state economic development tax credits in fiscal liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our liquidity and capital needs primarily through the use of funds generated from operations and from borrowings under our credit agreements 
our liquidity needs during fiscal were financed primarily from our operating cash flows 
we also issued common stock to purchase datek  as described under business combination 
we plan to finance our capital and liquidity needs for fiscal primarily from our operating cash flows and borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
in addition  we may issue other equity or debt securities 
we may also consider selling  or entering into a forward contract to sell  some or all of our million shares of knight trading group  inc knight common stock 
as of september   approximately million shares of our knight common stock were pledged or subject to pledge as collateral under an equity index swap agreement  as described under other contractual obligations 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of the stockholders may be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution in net book value per share or such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance 
table of contents our services and products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
dividends from our subsidiaries are another source of liquidity for the holding company 
some of our subsidiaries are subject to requirements of the securities and exchange commission sec and the national association of securities dealers relating to liquidity  capital standards and the use of client funds and securities  which limit funds available for the payment of dividends to the holding company 
under the sec s uniform net capital rule rule c under the securities exchange act of  our broker dealer subsidiaries are required to maintain at all times at least the minimum level of net capital required under rule c this minimum net capital level is determined based upon an involved calculation described in rule c  but takes into account  among other things  each broker dealer s net debit items  which primarily are a function of client margin receivables at our broker dealer subsidiaries 
since our net debit items can fluctuate significantly  our minimum net capital requirements can also fluctuate significantly from period to period 
historically  we have utilized our revolving credit facility as a mechanism to provide additional capital as needed to meet net capital requirements  and the balance on our revolving credit facility often has fluctuated significantly from period to period due to changes in our net capital requirements 
cash flow cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  compared to cash used in operations of million in fiscal the increase in cash flows from operations was primarily due to a substantial reduction in advertising expenditures compared to the previous year  and million of debt conversion expense net of income taxes in fiscal cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  due primarily to cash acquired in the datek merger in fiscal and substantially lower capital expenditures during fiscal compared to the previous year  partly offset by million of proceeds from the sale of epoch in fiscal cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the financing activities consisted mainly of net repayments on our revolving credit facility during both fiscal and fiscal loan agreement on december   we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement permits borrowings up to million through december   and is secured primarily by our stock in our subsidiaries 
prior to july   it was also secured by million shares of our knight common stock  and we could borrow up to percent of the fair market value of the pledged knight stock  subject to certain limitations 
on july   the lender under our revolving credit agreement agreed to amend the agreement to eliminate the knight stock as collateral and to eliminate the requirement that the borrowing availability under the agreement be limited based on the market value of the knight stock 
the interest rate on borrowings  determined on a monthly basis  is equal to the greater of i the national prime rate or ii day libor plus percent  subject to a minimum rate of percent 
at september   the interest rate on the revolving credit agreement would have been percent 
we also pay a maintenance fee of percent of the unused borrowings through the maturity date 
we had no outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit agreement at september  and million of outstanding indebtedness under the prior revolving credit agreement at september  we were in compliance with or have obtained waivers for all covenants under the revolving agreement for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
in december  we agreed in principle to a modification and extension of the revolving credit agreement 
the amended agreement will permit borrowings up to million through december   bear interest initially at the lesser of i the prime rate or ii day libor plus percent and will be secured primarily by our stock in our subsidiaries 
we will also pay a maintenance fee of percent of the unused borrowings through the maturity date 
we expect to execute the amendment by december  
table of contents convertible subordinated notes in august  we issued million of percent convertible subordinated notes due august  the holders of the notes may convert the notes into shares of common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date of the notes  unless previously redeemed or repurchased  at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes equivalent to an approximate conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
interest on the notes is payable on february and august of each year 
the notes are subject to redemption after august   and we may  at our option  redeem the notes at a premium on or after such date  in whole or in part  upon notice to each holder not less than days nor more than days prior to the redemption date 
in february  million of our convertible subordinated notes were converted for approximately million shares of class a common stock and million of cash 
as of september   we had approximately million of the convertible subordinated notes outstanding 
these notes are convertible into approximately million shares of common stock 
stock repurchase program on september   our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock from time to time over a two year period beginning september  we have funded our initial purchases with cash on hand and expect to fund any future purchases primarily with operating profits 
through december   we have repurchased approximately million shares at a weighted average purchase price of per share 
other contractual obligations we are obligated to pay our chief executive officer ceo million in deferred compensation  adjusted for investment income or losses on the million  pursuant to our employment agreement with the ceo 
this payment will be made not sooner than the day after the ceo s employment with the company terminates 
at september  and september   we had an equity index swap arrangement with a notional amount of million for the purpose of hedging our obligation under this deferred compensation plan 
changes in the fair value of this instrument are offset by changes in our obligation to our ceo 
as of september   approximately million shares of our knight common stock were pledged or subject to pledge as collateral under the equity index swap agreement 
we also have contractual obligations under operating leases for facilities and equipment

new accounting pronouncements sfas no 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs and is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the impact of sfas no 
to be material to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  rather than at the date of commitment to an exit plan 
risk factors stock market volatility and other securities industry risks have adversely affected our business 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from securities brokerage and clearing and execution services 
like other securities brokerage businesses  we are directly affected by economic and political conditions  broad trends in business and finance and changes in volume and price levels of securities transactions 
we are particularly affected by volatility in technology and internet related stocks because significant numbers of our clients invest in these types of stocks 
since may  the us securities markets have been very volatile  which has reduced trading volume and net revenues 
the terrorist attacks in the united states on september  also resulted in substantial market volatility and accompanying reductions in trading volume and net revenues 
in addition  the general economic downturn has adversely affected trading volumes and net revenues 
for fiscal  our average client trades per day were  compared to  and  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
for fiscal  our net revenues were million compared to million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these reductions in trading volumes and net revenues have adversely affected our profitability 
severe market fluctuations in the future or the continuation of current economic conditions could further reduce our trading volume and net revenues and adversely affect our profitability 
the market price of our common stock will fluctuate and could fluctuate significantly 
our common stock  and the us securities markets in general  have experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years 
the market prices of securities of internet related companies  in particular  have been especially volatile 
the price of our common stock could decrease substantially 
in addition  because the market price of our common stock tends to fluctuate significantly  we may become the object of securities class action litigation 
securities class action litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
substantial competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 
the market for electronic brokerage services is young  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
we expect the competitive environment to continue in the future 
we face direct competition from numerous online brokerage firms  including charles schwab co  inc  e trade group  inc  td waterhouse investor services  inc  harrisdirect and scottrade  inc 
we also encounter competition from the broker dealer affiliates of established full commission brokerage firms as well as from financial institutions  mutual fund sponsors and other organizations  some of which provide online brokerage services 
some of our competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  offer a wider range of services and financial products  and have greater name recognition and a more extensive client base than we do 
we believe that the general financial success of companies within the online securities industry will continue to attract new competitors to the industry  such as banks  software development companies  insurance companies  providers of online financial information and others 
these companies may provide a more comprehensive suite of services than we do 
in addition  our clearing operations compete with numerous firms that provide clearing and execution services to the securities industry 
we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors 
datek may be subject to claims that could affect our results of operations 
in january  the sec issued an order the sec order against icapital markets llc  a subsidiary of datek icapital 
the sec order was based upon alleged improper activities by the day trading business that was conducted by icapital s predecessor  datek securities corporation  until march when that business was sold to another broker dealer 
in the sec order  the sec charged icapital with securities fraud and violations of the broker dealer books and records and reporting provisions 
the sec 
table of contents censured icapital and ordered it to pay a million civil penalty 
icapital consented to the issuance of the order without admitting or denying the findings contained in it and paid the penalty 
the united states attorney s office for the southern district of new york simultaneously entered into a non prosecution agreement with datek and icapital for matters concerning the alleged improper activities 
through icapital  we may be subject to additional claims relating to the allegations contained in the sec order  including claims by governmental bodies  regulatory authorities or any other person for taxes  damages  indemnification  penalties and fines 
other than the sec order  no claims have been asserted against datek  icapital or any of their respective predecessors  successors or affiliates that relate in any manner to the allegations  facts  events  transactions  acts  occurrences or any other matter in the sec order 
if any such claims were to be asserted and to the extent that a determination were to be made that we were obligated to satisfy these claims  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we may not be able to successfully integrate datek s operations 
the integration of datek will be complex and time consuming  and will require management to dedicate substantial effort to it 
these efforts could divert management s focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operations during the integration process 
difficulties may occur during the integration process  including a loss of key officers  employees and clients  a loss of revenues and an increase in operating or other costs 
even if the integration of datek is successful  it may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the synergies and growth opportunities that we currently expect or these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame 
any failure to timely realize these anticipated benefits could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  expenses and operating results 
the estimates of operational cost savings resulting from the datek merger are inherently uncertain and may not be accurate 
we estimate that the merger with datek will result in operational cost savings of approximately million on an annualized  after tax basis 
these operational cost savings estimates are based on a number of assumptions  including that we will be able to implement cost saving programs such as personnel reductions  consolidation of operations  facilities and technologies  and elimination of duplicative administrative functions 
in addition  the operational cost savings estimates assume that the integration of the operations of datek will be successful 
failure to successfully implement cost saving programs or to successfully integrate the operations of datek on a timely basis will result in lower than expected cost savings in connection with the merger and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
systems failures and delays could harm our business 
we receive and process trade orders through a variety of electronic channels  including the internet  wireless web  personal digital assistants and our interactive voice response system 
these methods of trading are heavily dependent on the integrity of the electronic systems supporting them 
our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error  natural disasters  power loss  computer viruses  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
prior to the datek merger  all of our core computer systems and applications were fully redundant and were replicated at a secondary site that is substantially complete 
datek s core computer systems and applications  however  are not fully redundant and are not replicated at a secondary site 
extraordinary trading volumes could cause our computer systems to operate at an unacceptably low speed or even fail 
while we have invested significant amounts in the last few years to upgrade the reliability and scalability of our systems  there can be no assurance that our systems will be sufficient to handle such extraordinary trading volumes 
in the past  we experienced periods of extremely high trading volume that caused individual system components or processes to fail  resulting in the temporary unavailability of our web site for online trading and delays in our telephone systems 
on some other occasions  high trading volume 
table of contents caused significant delays in executing trading orders  resulting in some clients orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate 
from time to time  we have reimbursed our clients for losses incurred in connection with systems failures and delays 
we are also subject to an appeal of summary judgment granted in our favor in a putative class action lawsuit regarding claimed systems failures and delays 
systems failures and delays may occur again in the future and could cause  among other things  unanticipated disruptions in service to our clients  slower system response time resulting in transactions not being processed as quickly as our clients desire  decreased levels of client service and client satisfaction  and harm to our reputation 
if any of these events were to occur  we could suffer a loss of clients or a reduction in the growth of our client base  increased operating expenses  financial losses  additional litigation or other client claims  and regulatory sanctions or additional regulatory burdens 
capacity constraints of our systems could harm our business 
if our business increases  we may need to expand and upgrade our transaction processing systems  network infrastructure and other aspects of our technology 
many of our systems are  and much of our infrastructure is  designed to accommodate additional growth without redesign or replacement  however  we may need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth 
we may not be able to project accurately the rate  timing or cost of any increases in our business  or to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate any increases in a timely manner 
failure to make necessary expansions and upgrades to our systems and infrastructure could lead to failures and delays  which could cause a loss of clients or a reduction in the growth of the client base  increased operating expenses  financial losses  additional litigation or client claims  and regulatory sanctions or additional regulatory burdens 
regulatory and legal uncertainties could harm our business 
the securities industry in the united states is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws 
broker dealers are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business 
the sec  nasd and other self regulatory organizations and state securities commissions can censure  fine  issue cease and desist orders to  suspend or expel a broker dealer or any of its officers or employees 
our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our internal system to ensure compliance  as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel 
we could be subject to disciplinary or other actions in the future due to claimed noncompliance  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
recently  various regulatory and enforcement agencies have been reviewing systems capacity  client access  best execution practices  other service issues and advertising claims as they relate to the online brokerage industry 
these reviews could result in enforcement actions or new regulations  which could adversely affect our operations 
in addition  we use the internet as a major distribution channel to provide services to our clients 
a number of regulatory agencies have recently adopted regulations regarding client privacy and the use of client information by service providers 
additional laws and regulations relating to the internet may be adopted in the future  including regulations regarding the pricing  taxation  content and quality of products and services delivered over the internet 
complying with these laws and regulations is expensive and time consuming and could limit our ability to use the internet as a distribution channel 
implementation of nasd s position concerning permissible activity in cash accounts will restrict some trading activities of some of our clients and harm our business 
our broker dealer subsidiaries  iclearing and ameritrade  inc  permit cash account clients to utilize the proceeds from the sale of fully paid for securities to purchase other securities on the same day and in advance 
table of contents of the actual receipt of proceeds from the settlement of the sale of the fully paid for securities the specified trades 
iclearing and ameritrade  inc require the client to fund its cash account in advance with fully paid for securities or an amount of cash sufficient to cover the cost of any new purchase of securities 
upon a sale of the securities so purchased  the amount of the sale proceeds is recorded in the client s account on a real time basis on the trade date 
the sale proceeds recorded are then available to purchase other securities  and this sequence of trading may be repeated prior to the settlement date 
in october  nasd made an oral inquiry to iclearing regarding specified trades 
in august  nasd made a similar oral inquiry to ameritrade  inc nasd s inquiries focused on whether permitting specified trades in cash accounts was consistent with staff opinions and of the board of governors of the federal reserve system the january interpretations  which are interpretations of regulation t related to permissible activities in cash accounts 
in response to nasd s request  in july iclearing explained to nasd in writing  among other things  the reasons for its belief that permitting specified trades in cash accounts is common in the securities industry  posed no risk to investors and violated no applicable laws or rules  including the january interpretations 
in august  nasd concluded that permitting specified trades in cash accounts was prohibited by the january interpretations  and directed iclearing and ameritrade  inc to cease permitting this activity 
in august  ameritrade  inc informed nasd that it intended to comply with nasd s direction  but requested further information to make the necessary changes to its systems and procedures 
since that time  we have been engaged in a dialogue with nasd to obtain the necessary information 
beginning in september  we have sent notices to clients most likely to be affected explaining how the january interpretations may impact their trading 
in december  nasd informed ameritrade  inc that the january interpretations should be applied for the entire three day settlement cycle  rather than just to intra day trading on the trade date 
we are currently in the process of evaluating  designing  testing and implementing necessary changes to our systems and procedures to address this restriction 
due to the ongoing integration of iclearing and ameritrade  inc  and the differences in their respective systems and technologies  iclearing and ameritrade  inc may complete the necessary changes to their respective systems and procedures at different times  while making efforts to minimize disruption to clients 
we expect that this restriction on specified trades will result in a decrease in trading activity in some cash accounts  some clients closing their cash accounts  some clients converting to margin accounts and a potential increase in trading activity in some margin accounts 
we cannot predict with any degree of certainty the impact of this restriction on our revenues and profitability because we cannot adequately forecast the degree to which clients that have engaged in specified trades will adjust their trading activity  close cash accounts or convert to margin accounts  nor can we predict the impact of future prevailing market conditions and other factors over which we have no control 
although its impact is dependent on many factors that we cannot predict  we believe that this restriction on specified trades could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
we intend to conduct our business in conformity with all applicable laws  rules and regulations and expect to continue working cooperatively with nasd to address any future issues of interpretation or implementation that may arise 
however  nasd may elect to bring disciplinary proceedings against iclearing and ameritrade  inc if iclearing or ameritrade  inc 
does not prevail in any such proceeding  nasd may seek censures  fines  suspensions or other sanctions 
we may seek a ruling or interpretation by the board of governors of the federal reserve system or its staff to obtain relief from this restriction  though no assurance can be given that such relief would be granted 
the success of our business will depend on continued development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
the internet has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  significant growth in the number of users and amount of traffic 
our success will depend upon the development and maintenance of the internet s infrastructure to cope with this increased traffic 
the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure and could face similar outages and 
table of contents delays in the future 
outages and delays are likely to affect the level of internet usage and the processing of transactions on our web site 
in addition  the internet could lose its viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards to handle increased levels of activity 
our principal stockholders own a significant percentage of our common stock  which limits the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters 
j 
joe ricketts  our chairman and founder  members of his family and trusts held for their benefit collectively  the ricketts holders own approximately of our common stock 
investment funds affiliated with bain capital  silver lake partners and ta associates collectively  the datek holders collectively own approximately of our common stock 
the ricketts holders and the datek holders have entered into a stockholders agreement that obligates the parties to vote their shares in favor of a board of directors consisting of nine members  of which three are designated by the ricketts holders  three are designated by the datek holders and three are independent directors selected with the agreement of the parties 
the agreement also obligates the parties to vote in favor of specified merger and sale of the company transactions that are approved by the requisite directors and to vote against specified merger and sale of the company transactions unless they are approved by the requisite directors 
accordingly  these stockholders have significant influence over the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matters submitted to our stockholders for approval  including the election of directors  mergers  consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets  and also could prevent or cause a change in control 
the interests of these stockholders may differ from the interests of other stockholders 
in addition  third parties may be discouraged from making a tender offer or bid to acquire the company because of this concentration of ownership or the provisions of the stockholders agreement 
the terms of the stockholders agreement  our charter documents and delaware law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 
provisions in the stockholders agreement among the ricketts holders and the datek holders  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law will make it difficult for any party to acquire control of the company in a transaction not approved by the requisite number of directors 
these provisions include the presence of a classified board of directors  the ability of the board of directors to issue and determine the terms of preferred stock  advance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings  and the anti takeover provisions of delaware law 
these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock 
we will need to introduce new products and services to remain competitive 
our future success depends in part on our ability to develop and enhance our products and services 
there are significant technical and financial risks in the development of new or enhanced products and services  including the risk that we will be unable to effectively use new technologies or adapt our services to emerging industry standards  or develop  introduce and market enhanced or new products and services 
in addition  the adoption of new internet  networking or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes could require us to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our services or infrastructure 
changes in payments for routing our clients orders could adversely affect our business 
we have arrangements with several execution agents to receive cash payments in exchange for routing trade orders to these firms for execution 
competition between execution agents and the implementation of order handling rules and decimalization of stock prices has made it less profitable for execution agents to offer order flow payments to broker dealers 
on a per trade basis  our payment for order flow revenue has decreased significantly over the past several years 
these payments may continue to decrease on a per trade basis  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 

table of contents our networks may be vulnerable to security risks 
the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks is a critical element of our operations 
we have not experienced significant network security problems in the past 
however  our networks may in the future be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses and other security problems 
persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our confidential information or our clients confidential information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations 
we may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches 
we may not be able to implement security measures that will protect against all security risks 
failure to comply with net capital requirements could adversely affect our business 
the sec  nasd and various other regulatory agencies have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker dealers 
net capital is a measure  defined by the sec  of a broker dealer s readily available liquid assets  reduced by its total liabilities other than approved subordinated debt 
all of our broker dealer subsidiaries are required to comply with the net capital requirements 
if we fail to maintain the required net capital  the sec could suspend or revoke our registration  or nasd could expel us from membership  which could ultimately lead to our liquidation 
if the net capital rules are changed or expanded  or if there is an unusually large charge against net capital  operations that require the intensive use of capital would be limited 
a large operating loss or charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to maintain or expand our business 
our clearing operations expose us to liability for errors in clearing functions 
ameritrade  inc and iclearing provide clearing and execution services to each of our brokerage businesses  as well as to independent broker dealers  depository institutions  registered investment advisors and financial planners 
clearing and execution services include the confirmation  receipt  settlement and delivery functions involved in securities transactions 
clearing brokers also assume direct responsibility for the possession and control of client securities and other assets and the clearance of client securities transactions 
self clearing securities firms are subject to substantially more regulatory control and examination than brokers that rely on others to perform those functions 
errors in performing clearing functions  including clerical and other errors related to the handling of funds and securities held by us on behalf of clients and introducing brokers  could lead to civil penalties imposed by applicable authorities as well as losses and liability in related lawsuits brought by clients and others 
we are exposed to credit risk 
we make margin loans to clients collateralized by client securities and periodically borrow and lend securities to cover trades 
a significant portion of our net revenues is derived from interest on margin loans 
to the extent that these margin loans exceed client cash balances maintained with us  we must obtain financing from third parties 
we may not be able to obtain this financing on favorable terms or in sufficient amounts 
by permitting clients to purchase securities on margin  we are subject to risks inherent in extending credit  especially during periods of rapidly declining markets in which the value of the collateral held by us could fall below the amount of a client s indebtedness 
in addition  in accordance with regulatory guidelines  we collateralize borrowings of securities by depositing cash or securities with lenders 
sharp changes in market values of substantial amounts of securities and the failure by parties to the borrowing transactions to honor their commitments could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
acquisitions involve certain risks that could adversely affect our business 
we intend to pursue strategic acquisitions of businesses and technologies 
acquisitions may entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the integration of acquired operations  services and products  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  assumption of unknown material liabilities of acquired companies  
table of contents amortization of acquired intangible assets  which could reduce future reported earnings  and potential loss of clients or key employees of acquired companies 
these risks could cause the failure of any anticipated benefits of an acquisition to be realized  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we have established policies  procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks in the normal course of our business operations 
we seek to control the risks associated with our client activities by requiring clients to maintain margin collateral in compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines 
we monitor required margin levels daily and  pursuant to such guidelines  require our clients to deposit additional collateral  or to reduce positions  when necessary 
as a fundamental part of our brokerage business  we hold short term interest earning assets  mainly funds required to be segregated in compliance with federal regulations for clients 
these funds totaled billion at september  and billion at september  we invest these funds primarily in short term fixed rate us treasury bills and repurchase agreements 
our interest earning assets are financed primarily by short term interest bearing liabilities  totaling billion at september  and billion at september   in the form of client cash balances 
we earn a net interest spread on the difference between amounts earned on client margin loans and amounts paid on client credit balances 
since we establish the rate paid on client cash balances  a substantial portion of our interest rate risk is under our direct management 
at september   we had million of convertible subordinated notes outstanding  which bear interest at a fixed rate of percent 
at september   we had million of interest bearing indebtedness outstanding  consisting of million of convertible subordinated notes and million under our revolving credit agreement  which bears interest at a floating rate 
we hold a marketable equity security  which is recorded at fair value of million million net of tax at september  and has exposure to market price risk 
the same security was recorded at fair value of million million net of tax at september  the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent adverse change in prices quoted by the stock exchanges was approximately million at september  actual results may differ 
our revenues and financial instruments are denominated in us dollars  and we generally do not invest in derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
at september  and september   we had an equity index swap arrangement with a notional amount of million for the purpose of hedging our obligation under our deferred compensation plan for our ceo 
changes in the fair value of this instrument are offset by changes in our obligation to our ceo
