gene medicine products angiogenic gene medicine products for cardiovascular disease del gene medicine product in april  valentis acquired the rights and intellectual property related to the del gene and protein 
del is a novel extracellular matrix protein involved in early growth and development of blood vessels that has been demonstrated to have potential application in the treatment of certain vascular diseases by stimulating angiogenesis 
del has the potential to be effective in the treatment of a variety of cardiovascular diseases  including peripheral arterial disease and coronary artery disease 
del is a unique angiogenic factor that promotes vascular growth and inhibits endothelial cell death 
it has a distinct mechanism of action from other known angiogenic factors such as members of the vegf and fibroblast growth factor fgf families 
in june  valentis announced that its del gene medicine product elicited development of new blood vessels in studies of rabbits and mice 
a single administration of the del gene in muscle had similar effects on development of new blood vessels in rabbit and mouse models as a vegf 
gene used as a comparator in both studies 
acute toxicities observed with the vegf 
gene in dose response studies were not observed with the del gene at similar doses  suggesting that the del gene may have safety advantages over vegf 
valentis initiated a phase i ii clinical trial for a del gene medicine product for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease in june the goal of this open label  multi center  dose escalation trial is to evaluate safety and to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the del gene medicine product in patients with peripheral arterial disease pad  where the patients suffer from a blockage of the blood vessels in their legs 
the secondary objective of the trial is to obtain preliminary efficacy data and evidence of angiogenic activity 
for pad  valentis del product is administered by intramuscular injection 
il gene medicine product in june  valentis initiated a multi center phase ii clinical trial with its il gene medicine product for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck 
the goal of this randomized trial was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the il gene medicine product combined with chemotherapy and compare it to conventional chemotherapy alone in patients who have failed first line therapy 
the clinical trial was conducted at sites in germany  the czech republic and russia  and enrollment of the trial s patients was completed in january in june and september  we reported results from the phase ii clinical trial that showed a positive trend favoring the patient group receiving the il gene medicine product and chemotherapy as compared to the group receiving chemotherapy alone 
in december  the final analysis of the complete database from the phase ii clinical trial did not confirm the positive results seen in earlier interim analyses 
the positive trend in the il treatment group  compared to the chemotherapy alone control group  was not sustained 
valentis provided the final report from the trial to roche holdings ltd  our partner in this collaboration and in this clinical study 
in january  the company suspended clinical development of its cancer immunotherapy products following release of clinical data from the phase ii clinical trial of an il gene medicine product 
consistent with these developments and a decision by roche not to initiate a phase iii clinical trial  the company s alliance with roche ended in accordance with terms of the agreement 
intravenous il gene medicine product iv il gene medicine product in april  valentis dosed the first patients in a phase i clinical trial of our intravenously administered human il gene medicine product 
the goal of the trial was to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the iv il gene medicine product in patients with cancers in the lung 
by expressing the il gene locally in the lung  the iv il gene medicine product was designed to deliver the il protein to lung tumors while minimizing systemic exposure to il protein and associated adverse events 
due to a focusing of the company s resources on the clinical development of its del gene medicine product  this trial was closed after the first cohort  and the investigational new drug ind was inactivated 
commencing the same or a similar trial in the future would entail submitting an ind protocol amendment with an investigational plan to the fda 
other oncology therapy pigment epithelium derived factor pedf valentis is conducting research into the use of pedf pigment epithelium derived factor to treat cancer via anti angiogenesis 
we are determining whether a pedf gene therapy that cuts off the blood supply to tumors will shrink or eliminate both primary tumors as well as any sites of metastasis 
the pedf program is currently in the research stage 
tumor growth requires angiogenesis 
inhibition of angiogenesis represents a promising strategy for treating cancer 
potential pharmacokinetics and economic disadvantages of chronic delivery of recombinant antiangiogenic proteins make the delivery of antiangiogenic agents by gene therapy an attractive alternative 
the goal of this strategy would be to utilize the patient s normal muscle tissue as a factory for the production of increased circulating levels of an antiangiogenic agent such as pedf 
preclinical data demonstrate that mice treated with a single intramuscular im injection of pedf gene expressed pedf mrna for up to days 
moreover  growth of established tumors was inhibited by a single pedf im injection 
hematology gene medicine therapies eposwitch therapy anemia resulting from insufficient or ineffective erythropoietin epo occurs in patients with end stage renal disease  cancer or other chronic diseases 
the eposwitch product is designed to produce erythropoietin from skeletal muscle when an oral drug is given 
the oral drug turns on the geneswitch gene regulation system and the resulting epo may increase hematocrit  avoid the need for transfusions or repeat intramuscular or intravenous administration of recombinant human epo and thus improve symptoms of fatigue and shortness of breath associated with anemia 
the eposwitch product is administered as an intramuscular injection followed by electroporation 
the use of electroporation increases the uptake of the gene into the muscle cells and results in a marked increase in protein production 
plasmids encoding epo and the geneswitch proteins have been administered to mice  rats  dogs and pigs 
when the oral drug was given  significant increases in epo and or hematocrit levels were observed 
expression of erythropoietin has been seen up to days after treatment 
these studies demonstrated that the level and duration of erythropoietin expression could be controlled using the eposwitch product 
scientific and industry background gene therapy gene therapy is an approach to the treatment or prevention of certain diseases in which therapeutic genes are introduced into the body to cause the production of specific proteins needed to bring about a therapeutic effect 
for gene therapy to be effective  the therapeutic gene must be delivered to  and transported across  the outer membrane of a targeted cell and into the nucleus where it can be expressed 
the expressed protein may remain within the cell for an intracellular effect  be transported to the cell membrane to exert a cell surface effect or be secreted into the bloodstream to have a systemic effect 
most gene therapies utilize a delivery system  or vector  into which the therapeutic gene is incorporated to facilitate its delivery to  uptake by and expression in  the target cell 
genes provide the instructions or code for the productions of proteins  which determine the nature and function of cells and tissues in all living organisms 
the study of genes and their function genomics provides the fundamental basis for understanding human health and disease and has led to the identification of many genes with potential therapeutic utility therapeutic genes 
the entire genetic content of an organism is known as its genome 
in humans  the genome is believed to contain approximately  genes 
these genes encode approximately  proteins 
proteins enable cells to carry out their normal biological functions 
the process by which an organism utilizes genetic instructions and produces proteins is known as gene expression 
the expression of a defective gene  or the defective expression of a normal gene  is responsible for certain disease conditions 
for example  the expression of a single defective gene is known to cause cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia  and the defective expression of multiple genes is believed to be involved in the progression of diseases such as cancer  diabetes  and cardiovascular and neurological diseases 
the worldwide effort to decipher the human genome and to understand the function of its constituent genes is yielding important insights into the roles that genes play in disease conditions  as well as how genes may be useful in the treatment of such diseases 
it is estimated that about of genes have a known function  many of which have been identified as potential therapeutic genes 
various companies and academic institutions are investing substantial financial and human resources to identify additional therapeutic genes  and valentis believes that this process will create opportunities for gene therapies 
gene delivery approaches to date  a limiting factor in gene therapy has been the lack of safe  effective gene delivery systems 
a number of gene delivery approaches are being developed  each of which has exhibited certain limitations 
these approaches may be categorized by their mode of administration as ex vivo outside the body or in vivo inside the body and by the nature of the gene delivery system viral or plasmid based synthetic 
the first clinical trials of potential gene therapeutics used ex vivo viral gene delivery 
ex vivo gene therapies involve procedures in which selected cells are removed from the patient  transduced with the therapeutic gene  expanded in number  cleansed of contaminants and then reintroduced into the same patient 
this lengthy and labor intensive process significantly differs from traditional pharmaceutical administration and may result in a complex  high cost procedure 
valentis is developing a broad technology platform consisting of several in vivo  synthetic  plasmid based  gene delivery systems 
each delivery system consists primarily of two components i a plasmid dna a circular segment of dna that contains a therapeutic gene and components that regulate its expression in the cell and ii lipids  polymers and or other non viral agents to facilitate the delivery of the plasmid dna into target cells by various modes of administration  including inhalation  intravenous  intratumoral  intramuscular or intraperitoneal administration 
these traditional modes of administration are familiar to physicians and may be more convenient and cost effective than ex vivo approaches 
in valentis cationic lipid gene delivery systems  we combine negatively charged dna with novel  positively charged and neutral lipids to form tightly bound dna lipid complexes 
these complexes can be manufactured on a large scale to produce high purity  stable products 
valentis other gene delivery systems utilize polymers to form dna polymer formulations that facilitate the delivery of dna to cells 
valentis believes its proprietary plasmid based gene delivery systems have advantages over other gene delivery systems 
dna formulated with our pinc polymeric  non condensing formulations have been shown to produce high protein levels with decreased variability as compared to protein levels obtained after naked dna administration 
in addition  valentis gene delivery systems can preferentially accumulate in specific tissues and cell types and can be handled and administered like traditional pharmaceuticals 
we have demonstrated that we can produce clinical grade plasmid dna and plasmid based dna formulations under controlled conditions  and we have developed manufacturing and production methods designed to be scaled to meet commercial requirements 
we have tested our gene delivery systems in hundreds of animal experiments and in clinical trials 
our delivery systems allow for repeat administration of our gene medicine products for the treatment of chronic diseases  such as cardiovascular disease and cancer 
while the results of preclinical animal studies may not predict safety or efficacy in humans  when further clinical trials are conducted  valentis believes that our experience in research and development will enable us to accelerate the development of gene medicine products and thereby attract corporate partners 
valentis in vivo  plasmid based gene delivery approach we believe our proprietary plasmid based gene delivery systems may have the following benefits therapeutically relevant gene expression 
valentis has developed plasmid dna and delivery formulations  which  following administration to animals  produce therapeutically relevant protein levels 
tissue specific gene delivery and expression 
we believe that our gene delivery systems can accumulate in specific tissues and cell types 
in preclinical studies  we have demonstrated that various formulations are taken up selectively by i muscle cells following direct injection  ii vascular endothelial cells lining the blood vessels of several tissues  including lung  heart  spleen and lymphatic tissues  following intravenous administration  iii solid tumors following direct administration either into the tumor or other local tissues  and iv ciliated epithelial cells lining the airways of the lungs following aerosol administration 
ease of handling and administration  stability and scalable manufacturing methods 
valentis gene delivery systems are designed to be handled and administered like traditional pharmaceuticals 
these gene delivery systems are also designed to be stable when refrigerated and are intended to be distributed like other pharmaceuticals 
valentis has demonstrated that it can produce clinical grade plasmid dna and dna containing formulations under controlled conditions 
in addition  valentis has developed manufacturing and production methods designed to be scaled to meet commercial requirements and has produced plasmid dna at a contract manufacturer at the  liter scale 
improved safety profile 
we have tested our gene delivery systems in hundreds of preclinical studies and in clinical trials 
due to their improved safety profile as compared to viral delivery systems  valentis believes that our gene delivery systems will allow for repeat administration of gene products for the treatment of chronic diseases 
gene medicine products and technologies valentis is developing gene medicine products and technologies based on two broad classes of delivery enhancing materials lipids and polymers 
valentis has shown that gene delivery systems containing cationic lipids combined with neutral lipids enhance the cellular uptake of plasmid based gene expression systems 
these lipid based gene delivery systems have been demonstrated to enhance the entry of genes into tumor cells after intratumoral administration and deliver genes to the endothelium and epithelium of the lung after intravenous administration and inhalation  respectively 
valentis also has developed technologies that employ polymers that have been approved for human use 
we have shown that these polymers facilitate the delivery of genes into muscle cells or tumor cells after in vivo administration 
we are employing our proprietary pinc gene delivery system in hematology and cardiovascular gene medicine products 
valentis has demonstrated that the use of pinc gene delivery systems in muscle can lead to a significant increase in both the level and the consistency of proteins produced compared to the administration of plasmids formulated in saline  or naked dna 
to control the level and duration of selected genes in transgenic animals and cell cultures  valentis researchers have developed the geneswitch gene regulation system 
the geneswitch technology may accelerate the throughput of genomics research because it has the unique ability to control gene expression and assist in the identification and characterization of the function of selected genes 
pegylated products and technologies valentis optipeg pegylation technology allows for the gentle coupling of polyethylene glycol peg molecules directly to proteins  antibodies  viruses and liposomes in a manner that retains the biological activity of the material 
these peg molecules can protect the biologic from degradation or attack by the immune system 
this can yield products with improved safety  efficacy and dosing regimens 
we have intellectual property rights relating to liposome pegylation  a technology that polymasc  as part of the merger with valentis in  announced it would license or sell to a single partner 
valentis now believes that we can realize greater value from the technology by pursuing a licensing strategy on a product by product or on a field of use basis 
we have corporate out licenses with transkaryotic therapies tkt to develop pegylated versions of proteins and with onyx pharmaceuticals onyx for virus pegylation 
the tkt and onyx collaborations are licensing agreements 
see corporate collaborations below for additional details 
scientific and industry background pegylation some proteins have pharmacological profiles that could be improved with pegylation 
in order to achieve the levels required to exert a therapeutic effect at the target site  relatively large doses of protein have to be administered 
rapid clearance by the kidney and liver creates the need for these large doses as well as the need for frequent dosing 
intravenous bolus administration of the protein causes high initial blood levels of the therapeutic  which can create side effects 
subcutaneous administration  where feasible  is a better alternative to intravenous administration 
however  subcutaneous administration is associated with large losses of the protein typically over at the injection site  resulting in low biologic availability 
pegylation is an established technology that involves the attachment of the polymer polyethylene glycol to biological agents or chemical compounds to alter their pharmacokinetics distribution in the body  metabolism and excretion 
the alteration of the pharmacokinetics of biologics due to pegylation can lead to improved dosing intervals and may also have beneficial effects on safety and efficacy 
pegylation can be applied to otherwise insoluble proteins or to hide a therapeutic agent from the immune system 
with pegylation  both recognition by existing antibodies and stimulation of immune responses immunogenicity are potentially reduced 
potential advantages of pegylation technology valentis technologies potentially offer several advantages over conventional peg techniques i attachment of the peg chain is done under mild conditions thereby retaining high levels of bioactivity of the target molecule  and ii this technique utilizes a highly pure peg  improving its safety profile 
most peg processes were developed for small molecules rather than for biological agents 
biological therapeutics are far less resilient than chemical compounds and are often destroyed by harsh chemical processing of traditional pegylation 
our technology confers advantages with respect to preserving biological function of the therapeutic  reducing toxicities  reducing purification requirements and facilitating the manufacturing process 
in addition  our technology can be applied more effectively to a broader range of therapeutic targets  thereby enabling novel applications  such as linking different molecules to create novel compounds 
corporate collaborations valentis is actively seeking collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
in entering corporate collaborations  valentis seeks license fees  funding for research and development  milestone payments and royalties on product sales in exchange for worldwide commercial licenses to specific gene therapeutics and access to our development expertise 
valentis had corporate collaborative research and development agreements with the following companies roche holdings ltd 
in january  the company suspended clinical development of its cancer immunotherapy products following release of clinical data from a phase iib clinical trial of an il gene medicine product 
consistent with these developments and a decision by roche not to initiate a phase iii clinical trial  the company s alliance with roche ended in accordance with terms of the agreement 
in december  the final analysis of the complete database from the phase iib clinical trial did not confirm the positive results seen in earlier interim analyses 
the positive trend in the il treatment group  compared to the chemotherapy alone control group  was not sustained 
pursuant to the merger with genemedicine in march  valentis acquired rights under a corporate collaboration agreement with corange the parent company of boehringer mannheim  and now a subsidiary of roche originally signed in february  providing funding for research and development of gene medicine products to treat head and neck tumors and melanoma the roche agreement 
in august  the roche agreement was amended and extended through february the amendment modified the field of the agreement to gene therapy using the il  ifn a or il genes for the treatment of cancer and required valentis to conduct a phase ii clinical trial of the il gene medicine product and a phase i ii clinical trial for each of the ifn a and il gene medicine products 
as part of the amendment  valentis received the right to commercialize products developed under the agreement if roche does not initiate phase iii clinical trials on products within twelve months after the completion of phase ii trials 
valentis also agreed to forego a million equity purchase by roche due on february  in return for a million payment to be made to valentis by february  for reimbursement of development activities and an additional million milestone upon enrollment of the first patient in a phase iii clinical study 
subsequently  valentis and roche signed a further amendment postponing the million payment due on february  to february  this million fee was paid in fiscal also  through the merger with genemedicine  valentis acquired a worldwide co exclusive license  with the right to sublicense  from syntex usa inc  now also a subsidiary of roche and renamed roche biosciences  to its cationic lipid gene delivery technology dotma for in vivo gene therapy uses 
the license rights under this agreement continue even though the original agreement with syntex ended 
palliance with dsm biologics and qiagen nv in september  valentis and dsm biologics formerly gist brocades bio intermediair announced the formation of a broad  strategic collaboration focused on the manufacture and supply of plasmid dna and formulated dna to the entire gene therapy industry 
in may  qiagen nv joined the manufacturing alliance  referred to as the palliance

academic collaborations university of kuopio valentis has worked with dr 
seppo yl herttuala of the ai virtanen institute of the university of kuopio  finland 
dr 
yl herttuala has conducted two physician sponsored phase ii trials i for treating restenosis related to peripheral vascular disease and ii for treating restenosis related to coronary artery disease 
valentis provided its proprietary cationic lipid gene delivery system dotma for study with the institute s plasmids encoding a vascular endothelial growth factor vegf 
in november  results of a patient  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase ii clinical trial showed that the vegf 
gene incorporated into valentis proprietary lipid delivery systems can induce angiogenesis the formation of new blood vessels in the legs of patients with peripheral arterial disease 
the trial also demonstrated that the vegf 
gene delivered with valentis lipid delivery system was as effective as the vegf 
gene delivered by an adenoviral vector 
additionally  the safety issues associated with adenoviral vectors were not seen in patients receiving the gene delivered with valentis lipid delivery system 
the results of this trial  conducted in finland by professor seppo yl herttuala and colleagues  were presented this morning at the annual meeting of the american heart association 
all of the patients enrolled in this trial had peripheral arterial occlusive disease and were treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty 
following the angioplasty procedure  the patients were given a single administration of the vegf 
gene delivered with either valentis lipid delivery system  an adenoviral vector or a placebo 
patents and proprietary technologies patents and other proprietary rights are important to valentis business 
our policy is to file patent applications and protect inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business 
valentis also relies on trade secrets  know how  confidentiality agreements  continuing technology innovations and licensing opportunities to protect its technology and develop and maintain its competitive position 
to date  valentis has filed or participated as a licensee in the filing of numerous patent applications in the united states relating to our technology  as well as foreign counterparts of certain of these applications in many countries 
our failure to obtain patent protection or otherwise protect our proprietary technology or proposed products may have a material adverse effect on valentis competitive position and business prospects 
the patent application process takes several years and entails considerable expense 
there is no assurance that additional patents will issue from these applications or  if patents do issue  that the claims allowed will be sufficient to protect our technology 
valentis has numerous patents and patent applications worldwide covering its gene expression and delivery technology  and pegylation technology  as well as use patents for various therapeutic applications  and patents and patent applications on its manufacturing technology 
in addition to patents and patent applications filed and owned by valentis  we have exclusive rights under our licenses with baylor college of medicine  northwestern university  roche biosciences  the regents of the university of california  university of pittsburgh and vanderbilt university to patents and patent applications worldwide 
valentis has licensed from roche biosciences rights under certain us and foreign patents claiming the use of dotma for in vivo gene delivery 
we have licensed from vanderbilt and the regents exclusive rights to patents and patent applications covering the use of cationic lipids for gene delivery by systemic administration or by inhalation 
in a separate license with vanderbilt  we have licensed rights to vanderbilt s interest in the patents covering the del l gene and protein 
valentis has licensed from baylor patent rights covering our geneswitch gene regulation technology  patent rights on the use of certain muscle specific gene expression  and patent rights covering gene delivery to the joint 
we have licensed from northwestern university patent rights to the use of pedf for angiogenesis inhibition in cancer by non viral gene delivery 
we have licensed from the university of pittsburgh patent rights to the use of mnsod for damage caused by radiation or chemotherapy 
a number of the biopharmaceuticals that valentis and its corporate partners are investigating or may use in its products are or may become patented by others 
as a result  valentis or its corporate partners may be required to obtain licenses to gene sequences  proteins  viruses or other technology to which it currently has no proprietary rights in order to use or market such products 
in addition  some of the products based on our delivery systems may require the use of multiple proprietary technologies 
consequently  valentis or its corporate partners may be required to make cumulative royalty payments to several third parties 
such cumulative royalties could reduce amounts paid to valentis or be commercially prohibitive 
in connection with our efforts to obtain rights to gene sequences  proteins  viruses or other proprietary technology  valentis may find it necessary to convey rights to its technology to others 
there can be no assurance that valentis or its corporate partners will be able to obtain any required licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if required licenses are not available to valentis  we may not be able to develop or market certain products 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms are often uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
further  the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents is unpredictable 
valentis cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending applications or that we were the first to invent the technology that is the subject of such patent applications 
competitors may have filed applications for  or may have received  patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to compounds  products or processes that block or compete with those of valentis 
valentis is aware of patent applications filed and patents issued to third parties relating to genes  gene delivery technologies and gene therapeutics  and there can be no assurance that any patent applications or patents will not have a material adverse effect on products valentis or its corporate partners are developing or may seek to develop in the future 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert patent or other intellectual property infringement claims against valentis with respect to its products or technology or other matters 
patent litigation is widespread in the biotechnology industry 
litigation may be necessary to defend against or assert claims of infringement  to enforce patents issued to valentis  to protect trade secrets or know how owned or licensed by valentis  or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of third parties 
although no third party has asserted that valentis is infringing such third party s patent rights or other intellectual property  there can be no assurance that litigation asserting such claims will not be initiated  that valentis would prevail in any such litigation or that valentis would be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms  if at all 
any such claims against valentis  with or without merit  as well as claims initiated by valentis against third parties  can be time consuming and expensive to defend or prosecute and to resolve 
if other companies prepare and file patent applications in the united states that claim technology also claimed by valentis  we may have to participate in interference proceedings to determine priority of invention which could result in substantial cost to valentis even if the outcome is favorable to us 
valentis also relies on proprietary information and trade secrets to develop and maintain its competitive position 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques  will not gain access to valentis trade secrets or disclose such technology to the public or that we can maintain and protect unpatented proprietary technology 
valentis typically requires its employees  consultants  collaborators  advisors and corporate partners to execute confidentiality agreements upon commencement of employment or other relationships with valentis 
there can be no assurance  however  that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for valentis technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information  that the parties to such agreements will not breach such agreements or that valentis trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be discovered independently by its competitors 
for a description of our current patent litigation  see item legal proceedings  below 
manufacturing and commercialization valentis commercialization strategy is based on establishing corporate collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies whereby we will primarily pursue development up to phase ii clinical trials of gene therapeutics  while our partners will be responsible for late stage clinical trials  sales  marketing and large scale clinical and commercial manufacturing 
valentis intends that its large scale manufacturing of plasmid dna will be conducted either through contract manufacturing organizations cmo or at our corporate partners site after technology transfer 
through previous work at a cmo dsm  we have demonstrated that we can manufacture plasmid dna at scales required for clinical trials using conventional and proprietary fermentation and purification processes 
the facilitating agents of valentis gene delivery systems can be synthesized using readily scalable  organic synthesis procedures 
to date  we have obtained access to manufacturing of facilitating agents through arrangements with contract manufacturers 
preparation of the final formulations has been carried out at our pilot manufacturing facility and at contract manufacturers 
valentis intends that manufacturing of pegylation products will be conducted with contract manufacturing organizations or at potential corporate partner facilities 
valentis itself does not currently operate manufacturing facilities for commercial production of its products 
we have no experience in  and currently lack the resources and capability needed for  the manufacture or marketing of any of our products on a commercial scale 
accordingly  valentis will be dependent initially on corporate partners  licensees or other third parties for commercial scale manufacturing of our products 
we are not aware of third parties that have demonstrated sustained large scale commercial manufacturing of gene therapeutics 
there can be no assurance that our corporate partners will be able to develop adequate manufacturing capabilities for production of commercial scale quantities of gene therapeutics or pegylated products 
government regulation the production and marketing of valentis products and our research and development activities are subject to extensive regulation for safety  efficacy and quality by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  pharmaceutical products are subject to rigorous regulation by the united states food and drug administration fda 
we believe that the fda and comparable foreign regulatory bodies will regulate the commercial uses of our products as biologics 
biologics are regulated under certain provisions of the public health service act and the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act 
these laws and the related regulations govern  among other things  the testing  manufacturing  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  and the promotion  marketing and distribution of biological products 
at the fda  the center for biologics evaluation and research is responsible for the regulation of biological products and has handled the fda s regulation of most gene therapeutics to date 
gene therapy  however  is a relatively new technology  and it is uncertain whether any unique regulatory requirements may be imposed upon gene therapeutics 
we are not aware of any gene therapeutics that have received marketing approval from the fda or any comparable foreign authorities 
the necessary steps before a new biological product may be marketed in the united states include the following i laboratory tests and animal studies  ii the submission to the fda of an ind for clinical testing  which must become effective before clinical trials commence  iii under certain circumstances  approval by a special advisory committee convened to review clinical trial protocols involving gene therapeutics  iv adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product  v the submission to the fda of a biologics license application bla  and vi fda approval of the bla prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the biologic 
facilities used for the manufacture of biologics are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and other authorities  where applicable  and must comply with the fda s good manufacturing practice gmp regulations 
manufacturers of biologics also must comply with the fda s general biological product standards and also may be subject to state regulation 
failure to comply with gmp or other applicable regulatory requirements may result in withdrawal of marketing approval  criminal prosecution  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  warning letters  total or partial suspension of production  suspension of clinical trials  fda refusal to review pending marketing approval applications or supplements to approved applications  or injunctions  as well as other legal or regulatory action against valentis or its corporate partners 
clinical trials are conducted in three sequential phases  but the phases may overlap 
in phase i  the initial introduction of the product into human subjects or patients  the drug is tested to assess safety  metabolism  pharmacokinetics and pharmacological actions associated with increasing doses 
phase ii usually involves studies in a limited patient population to i determine the efficacy of the potential product for specific  targeted indications  ii determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage  and iii further identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
if a compound is found to be effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in phase ii evaluations  phase iii trials are undertaken to evaluate further clinical efficacy and to test further for safety within a broader patient population at geographically dispersed clinical sites 
there can be no assurance that phase i  phase ii or phase iii testing will be completed successfully within any specific time period  if at all  with respect to any of valentis or its corporate partners products subject to such testing 
in addition  after marketing approval is granted  the fda may require post marketing clinical studies that typically entail extensive patient monitoring and may result in restricted marketing of the product for an extended period of time 
the results of product development  preclinical animal studies and human studies are submitted to the fda as part of the bla 
the bla must also contain extensive manufacturing information  and each manufacturing facility must be inspected and approved by the fda before the bla will be approved 
similar regulatory approval requirements exist for the marketing of these products outside the united states eg  europe and japan 
the testing and approval process is likely to require substantial time  effort and financial and human resources  and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis  if at all  or that any product developed by valentis and its corporate partners will prove safe and effective in clinical trials or will meet all the applicable regulatory requirements necessary to receive marketing approval from the fda or the comparable regulatory body of other countries 
data obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials are subject to interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the fda may deny the bla if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied  require additional testing or information  or require post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product 
moreover  if regulatory approval of a biological product is granted  such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed 
finally  product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing 
among the conditions for bla approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to the appropriate gmp regulations  which must be followed at all times 
in complying with standards set forth in these regulations  manufacturers must continue to expend time  financial resources and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full compliance 
for clinical investigation and marketing outside the united states  valentis and our corporate partners may be subject to fda as well as regulatory requirements of other countries 
the fda regulates the export of biological products  whether for clinical investigation or commercial sale 
in europe  the approval process for the commencement of clinical trials varies from country to country 
the regulatory approval process in other countries includes requirements similar to those associated with fda approval set forth above 
approval by the fda does not ensure approval by the regulatory authorities of other countries 
valentis research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals and radioactive materials and produce waste products 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of such materials and waste products 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by such laws and regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated completely 
in the event of such an accident  valentis could be held liable for any damages that result  and any such liability could exceed our resources 
although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future or that any of the operations  business or assets of valentis will not be materially adversely affected by current or future environmental laws or regulations 
competition gene delivery  gene therapies and pegylation are relatively new  rapidly evolving areas of science in which significant and unexpected technological advances are likely 
rapid technological development could result in our products or technologies becoming obsolete before we recover a significant portion of our related research  development and capital expenditures 
we are aware that several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are actively engaged in research and development in areas related to gene therapy and pegylation or have commenced clinical trials of gene therapeutics and pegylation 
many of these companies are addressing diseases that have been targeted by valentis or our corporate partners 
valentis also may experience competition from companies that have acquired or may acquire gene technology or pegylation technology from universities and other research institutions 
as competitors develop their technologies  they may develop proprietary positions in certain aspects of gene delivery  gene therapeutics or pegylation that may materially and adversely affect us 
in addition  we face and will continue to face competition from other companies for corporate collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for licenses to proprietary technology  including intellectual property related to gene delivery systems or pegylation 
corporate partners may also elect to internally develop gene therapeutics that compete with our products 
lastly  many other companies are developing non gene therapies or non pegylation technologies to treat these same diseases 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater product development capabilities and financial  scientific  manufacturing  managerial and human resources than valentis 
there can be no assurance that research and development by others will not render our gene delivery systems  our pegylation products  or the products developed by corporate partners using our gene delivery systems or pegylation obsolete or non competitive  or that any product we or our corporate partners develop will be preferred to any existing or newly developed technologies 
in addition  there can be no assurance that our competitors will not develop safer  more effective or less costly gene delivery systems  gene therapeutics  pegylated products  non gene therapies  or other therapies  achieve superior patent protection or obtain regulatory approval or product commercialization earlier than valentis  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
product liability insurance the manufacture and sale of human therapeutic products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity 
valentis currently has only limited product liability insurance  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain existing or obtain additional product liability insurance on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
such insurance is expensive  difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  or at all 
an inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products by valentis 
a product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage  if any  or a product withdrawal  could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
employees as of september   valentis employed individuals full time  including who hold doctoral degrees 
of our total work force  employees are engaged in or directly support research and development activities  and are engaged in business development  finance and administrative activities 
valentis employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe our relationships with our employees are good 
risk factors we have received a going concern opinion from our independent auditors and this may negatively impact our business and stock price 
we have received a report from our independent auditors covering the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  that includes an explanatory paragraph which states that the financial statements have been prepared assuming valentis will continue as a going concern 
the audit report issued by our independent auditors may adversely impact our dealings with third parties  such as customers  suppliers and creditors  because of concerns about our financial condition 
the explanatory paragraph states the following conditions which raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern i we have incurred recurring operating losses since inception  including a net loss of million for the year ended june   and our accumulated deficit was million at june   ii our cash and investment balance at june  was million  and we had a net capital deficiency of million at june   and iii we have been notified that we have not complied with certain listing requirements of the nasdaq national market  and holders of our series a redeemable convertible preferred stock may require us to redeem their shares for cash if our common stock ceases to be listed on the nasdaq national market 
such redemption could aggregate up to million 
assuming that the holders of our series a preferred stock exercise their redemption rights  we will not have sufficient financial resources to satisfy these redemption obligations 
we will need to raise additional funds to continue our operations 
we will have insufficient working capital to fund our near term cash needs unless we are able to raise additional capital in the near future 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
any failure to obtain an adequate and timely amount of additional capital on commercially reasonable terms will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  including our viability as an enterprise 
as a result of these concerns  we are pursuing strategic alternatives which may include the sale or merger of our business  sale of certain assets  seeking protection under bankruptcy laws or other actions 
the company s common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market which could adversely affect the market price and market liquidity of the company s common stock and would trigger the redemption right of the holders of our series a preferred stock  which we would be unable to satisfy 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market 
on august   we received a nasdaq staff determination letter indicating that our common stock would be delisted from the nasdaq national market because our common stock market value of listed securities had been below the minimum million required for continued inclusion set forth in nasdaq marketplace rule b a and such noncompliance had extended beyond the day grace period provided by nasdaq marketplace rules 
the company also fails to comply with other requirements for continued listing  including million minimum stockholders equity and a minimum price per share 
on august   pursuant to nasdaq marketplace rule  we appealed the staff determination and requested an oral hearing in person before a listing qualifications panel to review the staff determination 
on august   we received a letter from nasdaq granting our request and setting a hearing date of october  as a consequence  the delisting action referenced in the august  letter has been stayed pending a decision by the listing qualifications panel 
on september   we filed a submission with the listing qualifications panel requesting an extension of time to achieve compliance with the continued listing requirements 
our submission outlined plans that would enable the company to achieve such compliance  including the consummation of collaboration agreements for the joint development of our products  restructuring of our outstanding series a preferred stock  a reverse stock split  reduction of our monthly burn rate  sale of certain non strategic assets and securing additional financing through the sale of equity securities 
however  there can be no assurance that we will successfully execute any of those plans or that nasdaq will grant us additional time after the october  hearing date to achieve compliance 
if delisting occurs  the trading of the company s common stock is likely to be conducted on the otc bulletin board 
the delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq national market will result in decreased liquidity of our outstanding shares of common stock and a resulting inability of our stockholders to sell our common stock or obtain accurate quotations as to their market value  and  consequently  would reduce the price at which our shares trade 
the delisting of our common stock could also deter broker dealers from making a market in or otherwise generating interest in our common stock and would adversely affect our ability to attract investors in our common stock 
furthermore  our ability to raise additional capital would be severely impaired 
as a result of these factors  the value of the common stock would decline significantly  and our stockholders could lose some or all of their investment 
additionally  under the terms of our series a preferred stock  upon the delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq national market  the holders of the series a preferred stock would have the right to require us to redeem some or all of series a preferred shares at a price of  per share  for an aggregate of up to million plus accrued dividends  if any 
the series a preferred stock is otherwise mandatorily redeemable beginning on june  as of september   there were  shares of series a preferred stock outstanding 
the full redemption of these shares would aggregate up to million 
we are pursuing a number of options with respect to the redemption rights of the series a holders including among other actions requesting waivers of such rights from the holders of the series a preferred stock and seeking to amend the terms of the series a preferred stock to eliminate all terms providing for cash redemption 
however  there can be no assurance that any of these efforts will be successful 
if they are not successful and the holders of our series a preferred stock exercise their redemption rights  we will not have sufficient capital resources to satisfy our redemption obligation 
we are pursuing strategic alternatives which include the sale or merger of our business  sale of certain assets  seeking protection under bankruptcy laws or other actions 
the reverse stock split approved by the board of directors may not increase our share price  may not prevent the delisting of our stock from the nasdaq national market and could result in an overall decline in our market capitalization our board of directors has authorized us to seek stockholder approval for a reverse stock split whereby each outstanding          or whole shares of our common stock would be reclassified and converted into one share of the company s common stock  with the final exchange ratio to be determined by the board 
we have not yet sought the approval of this action by our stockholders  and may do so only by means of a proxy statement for a special meeting of stockholders 
however  if we do seek stockholder approval for the reverse stock split  we can provide no assurance that our stockholders will approve such action 
even if the stockholders approve the reverse stock split  we cannot predict whether the proposed reverse stock split will increase the market price for valentis common stock 
even if the market price of our common stock increases  there can be no assurance that the market price per new share of valentis common stock after the reverse stock split will rise in proportion to the reduction in the number of old shares of valentis common stock outstanding before the reverse stock split  the reverse stock split will result in a per share price that will attract brokers and investors who do not trade in lower priced stocks  the reverse stock split will result in a per share price that will increase valentis ability to attract and retain employees and other service providers  and the market price per new share of our common stock will either exceed or remain in excess of the minimum bid price as required by nasdaq or that we will otherwise meet the requirements of nasdaq for continued inclusion for trading on nasdaq 
the market price of valentis common stock is also based on other factors  some of which are unrelated to the number of shares outstanding 
if the reverse stock split is effected and the market price of valentis common stock declines  the percentage decline as an absolute number and as a percentage of valentis overall market capitalization may be greater than would occur in the absence of a reverse stock split 
furthermore  liquidity of valentis common stock could be adversely affected by the reduced number of shares that would be outstanding after the reverse stock split 
as of june   we had a net stockholder s deficit of approximately million 
nasdaq national market listing rules requires us to have a minimum stockholders equity of million 
because our stockholders equity also fails to satisfy the requirements of continued listing on the nasdaq national market  our common stock may be delisted even if a reverse stock split is approved 
we must be able to continue to secure additional financing in order to continue our operations 
we will have insufficient working capital to fund our near term cash needs unless we are able to raise additional capital in the near future 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
any failure to obtain an adequate and timely amount of additional capital on commercially reasonable terms will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  including our viability as an enterprise 
as a result of these concerns  we are pursuing strategic alternatives which may include the sale or merger of our business  sale of certain assets  seeking protection under bankruptcy laws or other actions 
we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and through corporate collaborations 
we raised million in our initial public offering in september  million through a private placement of our common stock in april  million through the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock and common stock warrants in december and million from a public offering of common stock in december since september  we have received million from corporate collaborations  of which million was from roche holdings and  from boehringer ingelheim 
in addition  since september  we have received million from licensing our technologies to others 
we have not generated significant royalty revenues from product sales  and we do not expect to do so for the foreseeable future  if ever 
our cash and investments at june  were million 
based on the company s current operating plan  we anticipate that our cash  cash equivalents and investments and projected interest income  will enable us to maintain our current and planned operations at least through march   in the absence of additional financial resources and assuming we are not required to redeem the series a preferred stock prior to its mandatory redemption date 
in order to maintain our current and planned operations beyond march   we will be seeking additional corporate transactions  such as corporate partnership agreements  licenses and or asset sales  as well as additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing 
we may not be able to enter into any such corporate transactions  however or  if entered into  the terms of any such agreements may not generate near term revenues 
moreover  additional financing to meet our funding requirements may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
actions we may take to conserve our cash resources include a reduction in our personnel  delaying  scaling back or eliminating some or all of our research or development programs or relinquishing greater or all rights to products at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we otherwise would 
any or all of these actions would materially adversely affect valentis business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
in addition  the development and marketing of our potential products will require substantial additional financial resources 
because we cannot expect internally generated cash flow to fund the development and marketing of our products  we must look to outside sources for funding 
these sources could involve one or more of the following types of transactions  which we continue to actively seek technology partnerships  technology sales  technology licenses  issuance of debt securities  or sales of common or preferred stock 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including scientific progress in our research and development programs  size and complexity of such programs  scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  ability to establish and maintain corporate collaborations  time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  time and costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  and the cost of manufacturing material for preclinical  clinical and commercial purposes 
the future success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain corporate partners to develop and market our gene therapy or other products 
our business strategy is to attract business partners to fund or conduct research and development  clinical trials  manufacturing  marketing and sales of our gene therapy or other products 
this strategy makes us highly dependent upon corporate collaborations as a source of funding for our research and development and clinical trials 
we currently have no corporate partners for our geneswitch or del products  and are seeking partners to develop and market them 
we face intense competition from many other companies for corporate collaborations  as well as for for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for obtaining licenses to proprietary technology 
if we are unable to attract and retain corporate partners to develop and market our products  or if our corporate partnerships are not successful  our business will fail 
we have a history of losses and may never be profitable 
we have engaged in research and development activities since our inception 
we have generated only small amounts of revenue and have experienced significant operating losses since we began business 
for the year ended june   we recorded total revenues of approximately million and a net loss of approximately million 
as of june  we had an accumulated deficit totaling approximately million 
the development of our products will require significant additional research and development activities 
these activities  together with general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in operating losses for the foreseeable future 
if the market price of our common stock continues to be highly volatile  the value of your investment in the common stock could decline 
within the last months  our common stock has traded between a high of and a low of 
the market price of the shares of common stock for our company has been and may continue to be highly volatile 
public announcements may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
these announcements may include results of our clinical trials and preclinical studies  or those of our corporate partners or competitors  our operating results including results below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  developments in our relationships with corporate partners  developments affecting our corporate partners  negative regulatory action or regulatory approval with respect to our announcement or our competitors announcement of new products  developments related to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors  changes in the position of securities analysts with respect to our stock  acquisition or merger of the company by or with another company  bankruptcy filing or other restructuring actions  changes in our eligibility for continued listing of our common stock on the nasdaq national market  and market conditions for biopharmaceutical or biotechnology stock in general 
the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices for emerging biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies and which have often been unrelated to their operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price of our common stock 
conversion of series a preferred stock and the exercise of the related warrants could affect the market price of our common stock 
on december   we issued  shares of our series a convertible redeemable preferred stock   stated value per share  and common stock warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock with a current exercise price of per share  subject to adjustment 
the series a preferred stock is entitled to cumulative dividends that accrue at an annual rate of  payable quarterly 
each share of series a preferred stock  plus accrued and unpaid dividends  is convertible into shares of the company s common stock at a fixed conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment 
in january  one series a preferred stockholder converted all of its shares of its series a preferred stock into  shares of the company s common stock  but retained its class a and class b common stock purchase warrants exercisable for  and  shares of our common stock  respectively 
for additional information regarding the series a preferred stock and the common stock warrants  see note redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders equity in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
to the extent shares of series a preferred stock are converted  the warrants are exercised and the dividends on the series a preferred stock are paid in shares of common stock rather than cash  a significant number of shares of common stock may be sold into the market  which could decrease the price of our common stock and may result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock 
the sale and issuance of the series a preferred stock would impact earnings available to common stockholders 
under accounting rules  approximately million of the proceeds from our sale of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock was allocated to the common stock warrants and the beneficial conversion feature and are reflected as additional paid in capital 
this million will be accreted to the preferred stock amount over the term of the initial year redemption period 
this accretion  along with the preferred stock dividend  increases the net loss reduces the net income available to common stockholders 
development and commercial introduction of our gene therapy and other products will require several years of research and development and clinical trials and must satisfy applicable government regulations 
all of our potential products currently are in research  preclinical development or the early stages of clinical testing  and commercialization of those products will not occur for at least the next several years  if at all 
moreover  some of our potential products are in the early stages of research and development  and we may abandon further development efforts on these potential products before they reach clinical trials 
gene therapeutics and pegylation technologies are new fields and may not lead to commercially viable pharmaceutical products 
prior to commercialization  a potential drug or biological product must undergo rigorous clinical trials that meet the requirements of the food and drug administration  or fda  in order to demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans 
we have limited experience in conducting clinical trials  and we may encounter problems that cause us  or the fda  to delay  suspend or terminate these studies and trials 
problems we may encounter include the unavailability of preferred sites for conducting the trials  an insufficient number of test subjects and other factors which may delay the advancement of our clinical trials  lead to increased costs or result in the termination of the clinical trials altogether 
furthermore  the fda may suspend clinical trials at any time if it believes the subjects participating in the trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or if it finds deficiencies in the clinical trial process or the conduct of the investigation 
while many of these risks are common to biotechnology companies in general  in light of the issues raised in when the fda stopped a gene therapy clinical trial due to the death of a patient  we may face greater risks in this area than other biotechnology companies because of our focus on gene based therapeutics 
even if we successfully complete the required preclinical testing and clinical trials  we may not be able to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to market our gene therapy and other products in the united states or abroad 
the approval procedures for marketing outside the united states vary among countries and can involve additional testing 
we and other gene therapy companies have limited experience with the regulatory process  which for our industry tends to be costly  time consuming and subject to unpredictable delays 
accordingly  we cannot predict with any certainty how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for manufacturing and marketing our gene therapy and other products or whether we will be able to obtain those regulatory approvals at all 
we must rely on our partners to demonstrate large scale manufacturing capabilities in order to be successful 
our limited manufacturing experience makes our ability to successfully introduce our potential products more difficult than it would be otherwise 
although we entered into the palliance  a strategic collaboration with dsm biologics dsm and qiagen nv  for manufacturing and supplying plasmid dna to the gene therapy industry  neither dsm nor any third party has successfully manufactured plasmid dna on a sustained large scale commercial basis 
either our current contract manufacturing organization cmo  cangene corporation cangene  another cmo or a future corporate partner will have full responsibility for manufacturing material for commercial sale 
we will depend on cangene and or our corporate partners for commercial scale manufacturing of our products 
cangene and or our corporate partners may be unable to develop adequate manufacturing capabilities for commercial scale quantities of gene products 
if cangene or third parties are unable to establish and maintain large scale manufacturing capabilities  we will be unable to introduce sufficient product to sustain our business 
problems in our partners manufacturing facilities may delay clinical trials or regulatory approval for del or future products 
drug manufacturing facilities regulated by the fda must comply with the fda s good manufacturing practice regulations 
such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and state authorities 
manufacturers of biologics also must comply with the fda s general biological product standards and also may be subject to state regulation 
we may be unable to ensure that our contract manufacturers attain or maintain compliance with current or future good manufacturing practice requirements 
as we have experienced  the failure of our contract manufacturer to comply with good manufacturing practice requirements could cause significant delay of important clinical trials 
for example  in august  we discovered manufacturing issues at our contract manufacturer that resulted in a delay in our del pad clinical trial 
when we discovered the issues  we postponed enrollment in the clinical trial until we could fully assess their impact 
we also informed the fda of the issues 
on september   the fda placed a clinical hold on our del pad clinical trial 
on february   the fda allowed us to proceed with our pad safety trial using newly manufactured material 
since that time  we have continued to manufacture new material at another manufacturing site 
if we were to discover other problems  the fda could suspend or further delay our clinical trials or place restrictions on our ability to conduct clinical trials  including the mandatory withdrawal of the product from the clinical trials 
this  or an unexpected increase in the cost of compliance  could hinder our ability to develop products for commercialization 
if the success of our potential products in animal models is not replicated in our human clinical trials  the development of our gene therapy or other products will be negatively impacted 
although a number of our potential products  including del  have shown successful results in early stage animal models  these results may not be replicated in our human clinical trials for those products 
in addition  human clinical results could be different from our expectations following our preclinical studies with large animals 
if results in our human clinical trials for a particular product are not consistent with the results in the animal models  then we may have to return the product to preclinical development or abandon development of the potential product 
the results of our early clinical trials are based on a small number of patients over a short period of time  and our success may not be indicative of results in a large number of patients or long term efficacy 
the results in early phases of clinical testing are based upon limited numbers of patients and a limited follow up period 
typically  our phase i clinical trials for indications of safety enroll less than patients 
our phase ii clinical trials for efficacy typically enroll less than patients 
actual results with more data points may not confirm favorable results from earlier stage trials 
in addition  we do not yet know if early results will have a lasting effect 
if a larger population of patients does not experience positive results  or if these results do not have a lasting effect  our products may not receive approval from the fda 
moreover  any report of clinical trial results that are below the expectations of financial analysts or investors would most likely cause our stock price to drop dramatically 
adverse events in the field of gene therapy may negatively impact regulatory approval or public perception of our potential products 
the death in of a patient undergoing a physician sponsored viral based gene therapy trial has been widely publicized 
following this death and publicity surrounding the field of gene therapy  the fda appears to have become more conservative regarding the conduct of gene therapy clinical trials 
this approach by the fda can lead to delays in the timelines for regulatory review  as well as potential delays in the conduct of our gene therapy clinical trials 
in addition  the negative publicity around the field of gene therapy appears to have affected patients willingness to participate in gene therapy clinical trials 
if fewer patients are willing to participate in our clinical trials  the timelines for recruiting patients and conducting the trials will be delayed 
the commercial success of our potential products will depend in part on public acceptance of the use of gene therapy for the prevention or treatment of human diseases 
negative public reaction to gene therapy in general could result in stricter labeling requirements of gene therapy products  including any of our products  and could cause a decrease in the demand for products we may develop 
intense competition in the biopharmaceuticals market may adversely impact our business 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are highly competitive 
we are aware of several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are pursuing gene therapeutics or are incorporating peg technologies into new pharmaceuticals 
for example  we are aware that vical inc  targeted genetics corp  genvec  inc  cell genesys  inc  avigen  inc and genstar therapeutics corp 
are also engaged in developing gene therapies  and enzon inc and inhale therapeutics systems  inc 
are developing peg technologies 
many of these companies are addressing diseases that have been targeted by us directly or through our corporate partners  and many of them may have more experience in these areas 
we also face competition from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies using more traditional approaches to treating human diseases 
for example  amgen  inc and ortho biotech  inc 
currently market erythropoietin for the treatment of anemia  a condition for which we are developing our eposwitch product 
our competitors may develop safer  more effective or less costly biologic delivery systems  gene therapeutics or chemical based therapies 
in addition  competitors may achieve superior patent protection or obtain regulatory approval or product commercialization earlier than we do 
many of our competitors have substantially more experience and financial and infrastructure resources than we do in the following areas research  development  including clinical trials  obtaining food and drug administration and other regulatory approvals  and manufacturing  marketing and distribution 
gene therapy and pegylation of biologics are new and rapidly evolving fields and are expected to continue to undergo significant and rapid technological change 
rapid technological development by our competitors could result in our actual and proposed technologies  products or processes losing market share or becoming obsolete 
we face intense competition and other obstacles in recruiting the limited number of qualified personnel for key management  scientific and technical positions 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain management  scientific and technical staff to develop our potential products and formulate our research and development strategy 
the san francisco bay area  where our corporate headquarters and clinical development center is located  is home to a large number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  and there is a limited number of qualified individuals to fill key scientific and technical positions 
our recruiting efforts are further hampered by the high cost of living in the bay area and the competing opportunities in academia that may attract individuals with advanced scientific degrees 
although we have programs in place to retain personnel  including programs to create a positive work environment and competitive compensation packages  competition for key scientific and technical employees in our field is intense  and it may be difficult for us to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees 
additionally  after the corporate reorganization announced in january that resulted in the termination of forty seven positions  it may be more difficult to recruit positions in the future 
if we do not attract and retain qualified personnel  our research and development programs could be delayed  and we could experience difficulties in generating sufficient revenue to maintain our business 
if we are unable to obtain rights to proprietary genes  proteins or other technologies  we will be unable to operate our business 
both our gene medicine products and our pegylated products involve multiple component technologies  many of which may be patented by others 
for example  our products use gene sequences and or proteins  some of which have been  or may be  patented by others 
as a result  we may be required to obtain licenses to those gene sequences  proteins or other technologies 
we may not be able to obtain a license to those technologies on reasonable terms  if at all 
as a consequence  we might be prohibited from developing potential products or we might have to make cumulative royalty payments to several companies 
these cumulative royalties would reduce amounts paid to us or could make our products too expensive to develop or market 
an inability to protect our patents and proprietary rights may adversely impact our business 
we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights  which may limit our ability to compete effectively 
our success will depend to a significant degree on our ability to obtain patents and patent licenses  preserve trade secrets  and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others 
we own or have licenses to patents on a number of genes  processes  practices and techniques critical to our existing and potential gene therapy or other products 
patent positions in the field of biotechnology are highly uncertain and involve complex legal  scientific and factual questions 
our patent applications may not result in issued patents 
even if we secure a patent  the patent may not afford adequate protection against our competitors 
if we fail to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technologies  our competitors may market competing products that threaten our market position 
in addition  the failure of our licensors to obtain and maintain patent protection for technology they license to us could similarly harm our business 
on april   we announced that our wholly owned subsidiary  polymasc pharmaceuticals  filed a lawsuit against alza corporation subsequently acquired by johnson and johnson inc for patent infringement  based on alza s manufacture and sale of its liposomal product  doxil and caelyx 
the lawsuit was filed in the us district court in delaware  and alleges infringement of polymasc s us patent number  entitled liposomes 
a trial is anticipated to begin in december  which  if resolved in alza s favor  will substantially harm our ability to enforce the patent 
on april   valentis wholly owned subsidiary  polymasc pharmaceuticals plc  was granted european patent number ep  b  covering pegylated liposomes liposomes having polyethylene glycol peg chains attached 
in addition  valentis announced that polymasc has initiated infringement proceedings in germany  against sp labo nv  sp europe and essex pharma gmbh  all members of the schering plough group 
the suit alleges infringement of this patent and patent ep  b  also owned by polymasc  based on the sales of caelyx  a pegylated liposome product encapsulating the drug doxorubicin 
patent ep  b  titled liposomes  is the european counterpart to us patent number  we have received notification that alza has filed a demand for an invalidation trial with the japanese patent office  requesting invalidation of claim five of japanese patent no 
 which is the japanese counterpart to the us patent described above 
with this action  alza is appealing the previous finding of the opposition division of the japanese patent office in favor of polymasc s patent 
this matter is still outstanding and if this appeal is successful  we will be unable to enforce the patent claim at issue in japan against alza or other parties 
in any event  these and other intellectual property disputes could be costly  could divert management s attention and resources away from our operations  and could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidation of our patent rights 
as the biotechnology industry expands  the risks increase that other companies may challenge our proprietary rights or claim that our processes and potential products infringe on their patents 
if we infringe on another company s patented processes or technology  we may have to obtain a license in order to continue manufacturing or marketing the affected product or using the affected process or have to pay damages 
we may be unable to obtain a license on acceptable terms or at all 
we also rely on unpatented trade secret technologies 
because these technologies do not benefit from the protection of patents  we may be unable to meaningfully protect these trade secret technologies from unauthorized use or misappropriation by a third party 
item properties valentis leases approximately  square feet in burlingame  california the burlingame facility and a  square foot building in the woodlands  texas the woodlands facility  both of which were occupied as of june  the facilities have been built to valentis specifications to accommodate our laboratory  support and administrative needs and include manufacturing facilities designed to supply material required for preclinical research and development and initial clinical trials 
the term of the lease for  square feet in use at the burlingame facility expires in  at which time we have the option to renew the lease for an additional period of five years 
an additional  square feet of the burlingame facility has been built out for use as a pilot manufacturing facility 
the term of the lease for this portion of the facility expires in  at which time we have the option to renew the lease for an additional period of five years 
the initial term of the lease for the woodlands facility  which began in january  is years  after which time valentis may renew the lease for an additional period of five years 
in january  valentis implemented a restructuring plan to better align the company s cost structure with current market conditions 
this plan significantly reduced its preclinical product development efforts and suspended its clinical programs in oncology in an effort to lower future expenditures and conserve cash 
a total of positions  primarily in preclinical and manufacturing research and development  and associated general and administrative staff  were eliminated 
as a result of the restructuring  the company has significantly reduced its presence in the woodlands 
we are currently evaluating our plans with regards to the woodlands facility 
based on market analysis  the company believes that its lease obligations for the woodlands facility can be assigned or subleased without material financial impact 
polymasc  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  leased three properties totaling approximately  square feet in london  england 
the initial terms of the leases for these facilities  which began between and  were from three to five years 
in april  valentis announced that it would close its london facilities and consolidate all of its pegylation research activities into the woodlands facility 
the closure and consolidation were substantially completed in september the company exited the facilities and withdrew from the remaining term of the lease in september without penalty or ongoing obligation 
valentis believes that its facilities are adequate to meet its needs for the foreseeable future 
should we need additional space  management believes it will be able to secure such space on reasonable terms 
item legal proceedings on april   valentis wholly owned subsidiary  polymasc pharmaceuticals  filed a lawsuit against alza corporation subsequently acquired by johnson johnson inc for patent infringement based on alza s manufacture and sale of its liposomal products  doxil and caelyx 
the lawsuit was filed in the us district court in delaware and alleges infringement of us patent number  titled liposomes 
the patent  issued october   is directed towards pegylated liposomes liposomes having peg chains attached

company overview valentis is converting biologic discoveries into innovative products 
valentis has three product platforms for the development of novel therapeutics the gene medicine  geneswitch and dna vaccine platforms 
the gene medicine platform includes a comprehensive array of proprietary nucleic acid delivery systems  including the broad cationic lipid portfolio  from which appropriate formulations and modalities may be selected and tailored to fit selected genes  indications and target tissues 
the del gene medicine therapeutic is the lead product for the gene medicine platform of non viral gene delivery technologies 
del is an angiogenesis gene that is being developed for peripheral arterial disease and ischemic heart disease 
the eposwitch therapeutic for anemia is the lead product for the geneswitch platform and is being developed to allow control of erythropoietin protein production from an injected gene by an orally administered drug 
valentis has developed synthetic vaccine delivery systems based on several classes of polymers and has proprietary pinc polymer based delivery technologies for intramuscular administration  which provide for higher and more consistent levels of antigen production 
the merger of megabios corp 
and genemedicine  inc in march formed valentis inc  a delaware corporation 
in august  valentis acquired uk based polymasc pharmaceuticals plc 
valentis currently has centers in two locations burlingame  california  which is the company s headquarters  as well as the center for manufacturing and clinical development  and the woodlands  texas  which houses personnel focused on preclinical development 
on april   the company announced that it would consolidate all of its pegylation research activities from its facilities in london  england into its preclinical center in the woodlands  texas 
the consolidation was substantially completed in september in january  valentis implemented a restructuring plan to better align the company s cost structure with current market conditions 
this plan significantly reduced its preclinical product development efforts and suspended its clinical programs in oncology in an effort to lower future expenditures and conserve cash 
a total of positions  primarily in preclinical and manufacturing research and development and associated general and administrative staff  were eliminated as a result of the restructuring 
gene medicine products valentis gene medicine products provide novel ways to achieve production of therapeutic proteins in their most natural and active form at specific sites within the body 
upon delivery  genes formulated with synthetic delivery systems enter targeted cells and produce the therapeutic proteins 
the fidelity  specificity and duration of expression within the target cells are controlled by valentis proprietary gene regulation systems 
synthetic gene delivery systems valentis has developed synthetic gene delivery systems based on several classes of delivery enhancing materials  including polymers and lipids 
our pinc polymeric  non condensing polymers are designed to provide efficient delivery to a variety of tissues  including muscle and solid tumors 
valentis cationic lipids provide efficient gene delivery after intravenous or intratumoral administration 
both delivery systems have been demonstrated to enhance the cellular distribution and uptake of plasmid based gene expression systems in vivo  resulting in therapeutic levels of gene expression 
valentis synthetic gene delivery systems can be used with a wide variety of genes  as evidenced by prior and ongoing preclinical efforts and clinical trials in cardiovascular disease  hematology  oncology and infectious disease 
in addition  valentis has an extended portfolio of proprietary synthetic gene delivery technologies 
gene regulation systems valentis inducible gene regulation system  the geneswitch system  controls therapeutic gene expression through an orally administered drug 
in addition  our extended portfolio of gene expression components includes tissue specific promoters  post transcriptional expression elements and multi gene cassettes 
the geneswitch gene regulation system is available for licensing as a functional genomics research tool 
licenses of the geneswitch system include american home products  genzyme corporation  glaxosmithkline  lexicon genetics  medigene ag and pfizer 
synthetic vaccine delivery systems valentis has developed synthetic vaccine delivery systems based on several classes of polymers 
our proprietary pinc polymer based delivery technologies provide consistent levels of gene expression and enhance transfection efficiency of plasmid dna delivered intramuscularly or intratumorally 
our formulation technologies have been used in various clinical candidates  and formulations can be optimized for specific dna vaccine delivery needs 
pegylation systems polymer based biopharmaceutical delivery valentis optipeg family of technologies is based on polymer modification using polyethylene glycol peg  a compound with a long and safe clinical history 
we have developed breakthrough methods to directly couple our proprietary peg optipeg to proteins  peptides  antibodies and antibody fragments  viruses and liposomes to retain high levels of biological activity of the material and potentially protect the biopharmaceutical from inactivation by the immune system 
optipeg technologies provide the potential to deliver products with improved safety  efficacy and dosing regimens 
optipeg is being developed through licensing to corporate partners 
current good manufacturing practices manufacturing valentis has developed proprietary scalable processes for the manufacture of plasmid dna and gene medicine biopharmaceuticals 
through a strategy of using a contract manufacturing organization cmo for production of our biopharmaceuticals  we are able to produce material from lab to commercial scale using the same process 
cangene corporation is our primary cmo 
valentis has also established manufacturing alliances for our proprietary  biologically optimized peg optipeg 
technology licenses valentis currently has technology out licenses with ark therapeutics formerly eurogene  ltd 
for cardiovascular diseases using gene therapy and ark s collar delivery system  cardion ag for the development of gene therapeutics for restenosis  epimmune inc for the license of valentis proprietary pinc gene delivery technology for hiv and hcv vaccines  genencor international for the license of valentis proprietary pinc gene delivery technology for hbv and hpv vaccines  heska corporation for gene immunotherapeutics for cancer and allergies in companion animals  and invitrogen corporation to sell valentis proprietary geneswitch gene regulation system to the research market 
valentis has licensed its proprietary geneswitch gene regulation technology on a non exclusive basis to wyeth ayerst laboratories  the pharmaceutical division of american home products  glaxosmithkline  lexicon genetics  medigene ag and pfizer inc for functional genomics research 
further  valentis has established a non exclusive cross license with genzyme corporation in which genzyme receives rights to geneswitch gene regulation technology for research use  and valentis receives certain rights to genzyme s plasmid dna manufacturing technology 
valentis also has a technology in license with genetronics biomedical corp 
for in vivo electroporation technology for use in the development of certain gene based products 
on august   valentis acquired polymasc pharmaceuticals plc 
at that time polymasc s pegylation research and development programs were in various stages of preclinical development 
currently  none of the products utilizing polymasc s proprietary optipeg technology has entered any stage of human clinical testing or has been approved for marketing 
initially  our strategy was to develop and commercialize peg products through alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
due to a prioritization of the company s research and development efforts  our strategy has shifted to developing optipeg through licensing to corporate partners 
to date  substantially all revenue has been generated by collaborative research and development agreements from corporate partners  and no revenue has been generated from product sales 
under the terms of our corporate collaborations  valentis generally receives research and development funding on a quarterly basis in advance of associated research and development costs 
we expect that future revenue will be derived in the short term from research and development agreements and milestone payments and in the long term from royalties on product sales 
we have incurred significant losses since inception and expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future  primarily due to the continuation of our research and development programs and because we do not expect to generate revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future  if at all 
we expect that operating results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
as of june   valentis accumulated deficit was approximately million 
potential delisting from the nasdaq national market the continued listing of our common stock on the nasdaq national market requires that we satisfy certain quantitative criteria  including  under nasdaq s maintenance standard  stockholders equity of million or net tangible assets of million and minimum price per share  or under nasdaq s maintenance standard  million market capitalization of listed securities and minimum price per share 
in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march   we disclosed that  as of march   we did not meet the stockholders equity or net tangible assets requirement under maintenance standard we also disclosed at the same time our intention to commence a tender offer to purchase for cash  shares  or  of the outstanding shares of our series a convertible redeemable preferred stock series a preferred stock and of the related common stock purchase warrants  class a and common stock purchase warrants  class b  which were issued to the holders of series a preferred stock in connection with their purchase of the series a preferred stock 
the purpose of the tender offer was to retire of the outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock 
our series a preferred stock has certain rights and privileges that preclude us from classifying the series a preferred stock within stockholders equity 
we stated that  in order to finance the tender offer  we planned to offer and sell shares of a newly created series of preferred stock  which would be designated series b convertible preferred stock  par value  per share and be convertible into shares of our common stock at a fixed conversion price that is based on the current market price of our common stock 
the series b preferred stock would have terms substantially similar to the existing series a preferred stock  except that it would not have the same redemption privileges and would be classified as equity 
accordingly  issuing shares of the series b preferred stock and retiring outstanding shares of the series a preferred stock would have the effect of increasing our stockholders equity 
on september   we announced that we are terminating and withdrawing the tender offer and pursuing other options with respect to restructuring the series a preferred stock 
on august   we received a letter from nasdaq advising us that our common stock market value of listed securities had been below the million market capitalization requirement for continued listing on the nasdaq national market  and that our common stock would be therefore subject to delisting from the nasdaq national market and such noncompliance had extended beyond the day grace period provided by nasdaq marketplace rules 
in response  we requested a hearing before a nasdaq listing qualifications panel the panel 
a hearing before a nasdaq listing qualifications panel has been scheduled for october  the company has been advised by nasdaq that the hearing request will stay the delisting of the company s common stock pending the panel s decision 
on september   we filed a submission with the listing qualifications panel requesting an extension of time to achieve compliance with the continued listing requirements 
our submission outlined plans that would enable the company to achieve such compliance  including the consummation of collaboration agreements for the joint development of our products  restructuring of our outstanding series a preferred stock  a reverse stock split  reduction of our monthly burn rate  sale of certain non strategic assets and securing additional financing through the sale of equity securities 
there is no assurance we can successfully execute any of those plans or that the panel will grant the company s request for additional time after the october  hearing date to achieve compliance 
if our securities are delisted from the nasdaq national market  the terms of the series a preferred stock permit the holders of the series a preferred stock to require us to redeem some or all of their shares of series a preferred stock  at a price of  per share  plus all accrued and unpaid dividends 
as of september   we do not have sufficient capital resources to satisfy our redemption obligations  which could aggregate million 
see further discussion in liquidity and capital resources below 
critical accounting policy valentis believes the clinical trial expense accounting policy represents its most significant estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
valentis accruals for clinical trial expenses are based in part on estimates of services received and efforts expended pursuant to agreements established with clinical research organizations and clinical trial sites 
we have a history of contracting with third parties that perform various clinical trial activities on behalf of valentis in the ongoing development of our biopharmaceutical drugs 
the financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations and may vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
the company determines its estimates through discussion with internal clinical personnel and outside service providers as to progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services 
the objective of valentis clinical trial accrual policy is to reflect the appropriate trial expenses in our financial statements by matching period expenses with period services and efforts expended 
in the event of early termination of a clinical trial  we accrue expenses associated with an estimate of the remaining  non cancelable obligations associated with the winding down of the trial 
results of operations fiscal years ended june   and revenue valentis revenue was approximately million for the year ended june  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the  and revenue contributions attributable to milestone achievements and collaborative research and development performed under our corporate collaborations  and grant revenues are in thousands year ended june  collaborative research and development revenue roche holdings  ltd 
   boehringer ingelheim eli lilly other  grant revenue total revenue    changes in revenue for each of the fiscal years ended june   and are explained below revenue from roche increased in fiscal over fiscal primarily due to the timing of recognition of million in accordance with the performance of contract research obligations over a twelve month period  approximately million of which was recognized in fiscal as compared to approximately million in however  this increase of approximately million was offset by the partial recognition of approximately million in research funding in fiscal this offset resulted in a net increase of approximately  in fiscal compared to fiscal revenue from roche decreased for fiscal as compared to due to a  milestone payment that was recognized in revenue from boehringer ingelheim decreased for fiscal compared to the prior year due to the completion of the agreement in november revenue from boehringer ingelheim was recognized under a month collaboration signed in september revenue and preclinical work under the eli lilly agreement was completed during fiscal other revenue in fiscal resulted primarily from several license agreements for valentis geneswitch technology of approximately  other revenue in fiscal resulted primarily from license revenue derived from an agreement with heska of approximately  revenue generated by several license agreements for valentis geneswitch technology of approximately  and revenue derived from the licensing of pegylation technology of approximately  other revenue in of approximately  resulted primarily from the revenue generated by polymasc  acquired by valentis in august grant revenue for fiscal decreased as compared to due to the completion of small business innovation research sbir grants in august grant revenue in fiscal increased slightly over due to the commencement of two sbir grants in in january  the company announced that it was suspending clinical development of its cancer immunotherapy products following release of clinical data from a phase ii clinical trial of an il genemedicine product 
consistent with these developments and a decision by partner roche holdings ltd 
not to initiate a phase iii clinical trial  the company s alliance with roche ended in accordance with terms of the agreement 
revenue derived from corporate collaborations and grants may increase in the future if we are successful in establishing new collaborations and are awarded additional sbir grants 
if we are unsuccessful in establishing new collaborations and grants  revenues will decline 
likewise  a reduction in funds for conducting our research and development  clinical trial  manufacturing  marketing and sales efforts will occur 
expenses research and development expenses were million for the year ended june   million in and million in the decrease for fiscal year as compared to was primarily attributable to staff reductions and savings resulting from the reduction of preclinical product development efforts and suspension of clinical programs in oncology 
the increase for fiscal year as compared to was primarily attributable to higher expenses for two new clinical trials that commenced during the period 
valentis expects research and development headcount expenses to decrease in the future reflecting the overall reductions in staff 
the company also expects clinical trial expenses to remain at or potentially to be below fiscal levels reflecting the company s overall cost reduction plans and prioritization of its research and development efforts 
however  research and development expenses may increase if the company is successful in securing additional new strategic partnerships and funding to support increased spending levels 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict at this time given the number of studies that will need to be conducted for any of our potential products 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps beginning with identification of a potential target and including  among others  proof of concept in animal studies and phase i  ii  and iii clinical studies in humans each of which is typically more expensive than the previous step 
our research and development expenses currently include costs for scientific personnel  animal studies  supplies  equipment  consultants  patent filings  overhead allocation  human clinical trials and sponsored research at academic and research institutions 
valentis develops products utilizing two key technology platforms i gene delivery and gene regulation products  and ii pegylation products 
for the years ended june   and  we estimated that the division of research and development expenses between the gene delivery and gene regulation products platform and the pegylation products platform was million and million  million and million  and million and million  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended june  from million in the decrease was attributable primarily to savings resulting from the reduction of general and administrative staff associated with our reductions in preclinical product development and suspended clinical programs in oncology 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended june  from million in primarily due to the additions of staff and facilities to support our increased research and development efforts 
we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease to reflect the company s overall cost reduction plans 
however  general and administrative expenses may increase due to the requirements of additions of staff and facilities to support increased research and development efforts if the company is successful in securing new strategic partnerships and funding to support increased research and development activities 
in fiscal  valentis recorded million of acquired in process research and development as part of the acquisition of polymasc 
details of the merger and acquisition are described below 
valentis recorded million  million and million for amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets in fiscal years  and  respectively  which is associated with the acquisitions of genemedicine in fiscal and polymasc in fiscal as of june   the company had approximately  of goodwill  which will no longer be amortized but will be subject to an impairment analysis on at least an annual basis in accordance with rules of sfas details of the mergers and acquisitions are described below 
corporate restructuring in conjunction with the company s announcement that it would suspend clinical development of its cancer immunotherapy products in january  valentis implemented a restructuring plan to better align the company s cost structure with current market conditions 
this plan significantly reduced its preclinical product development efforts and suspended its clinical programs in oncology in an effort to lower future expenditures and conserve cash 
a total of positions  primarily in preclinical and manufacturing research and development  and associated general and administrative staff  were eliminated as a result of the restructuring 
for the year ended june   we recorded restructuring and related charges of approximately million  of which million was recorded for employee severance 
of the million charge  approximately  has been paid and approximately  has been accrued as of june  all of the employees whose positions were eliminated have been terminated as of june  and the accrued employee severance of approximately  is expected to be paid by the second quarter of fiscal in addition  the company wrote off certain equipment and furniture located in the woodlands facility that would no longer be used due to the restructuring 
the net book value of these assets totaled approximately  and was recorded as an impairment charge associated with the company s restructuring plan 
in connection with the reduction in workforce  the company modified the terms of vested options to allow for an extended exercise period of months 
this modification did not result in the company recording any stock based compensation charges  as the exercise prices of the options exceeded the per share price of the company s common stock at the date of the modification 
as a result of its restructuring  the company has significantly reduced its presence in texas 
the company leases and currently occupies a  square foot building in the woodlands  texas 
the initial term of the woodlands facility lease  which began in january  is years  after which time valentis may renew for an additional period of five years 
the company plans to assign or sublease its woodlands facility 
based on market analysis  the company believes that its lease obligations for the woodlands facility can be assigned or subleased without material financial impact 
therefore  the company has not recorded  nor does the company anticipate recording  a charge related to exiting these facilities 
as a result of its restructuring  the company expects operating and depreciation expenses to decrease in fiscal interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net was million in  million in  and  in the increase in interest and other income expense  net in compared to resulted primarily from decreased interest expense derived form lower loan balances and favorable foreign currency exchange rates  partially offset by decreased interest income derived from lower investment balances 
the increase in interest and other income expense  net in compared to resulted primarily from increased interest income derived from higher investment balances

the accretion of class a and b warrants for the year ended june  and was approximately million and  respectively 
the accretion of the beneficial conversion feature for the years ended june  and was approximately  and  respectively 
the aggregate accretion value associated with the warrants and beneficial conversion feature was included in the calculation of net loss applicable to common stockholders 
the issuance costs of approximately million were accounted for as a discount on the redeemable preferred stock and are accreted over the year redemption period 
accretion of approximately  and  respectively  for the years ended june  and was included in the calculation of net loss applicable to common stockholders 
dividends on series a redeemable convertible preferred stock dividends on series a redeemable convertible preferred stock see note to consolidated financial statements are calculated at the rate of per annum and were approximately million and  for the year ended june  and  respectively 
these dividends were charged against additional paid in capital and included in the calculation of net loss applicable to common stockholders 
acquisition of polymasc research and development programs pegylation is the primary research and development technology that valentis acquired from polymasc in august valentis management is responsible for estimating the fair value of the purchased in process research and development 
the program has been valued based on a discounted probable future cash flow analysis using a discount rate of  which management believes adequately reflects the substantial risk of biologics delivery research and development 
in the valuation model  it was assumed that for product candidates based on polymasc s technology  preclinical studies and clinical trials are successfully completed  regulatory approval to market the product candidates is obtained  a marketing partner is secured and we are able to manufacture the product in commercial quantities 
each of these activities is subject to significant risks and uncertainties and no product utilizing the technology has been successfully developed to date 
the valuation resulted in million being charged as purchased in process research and development expenses in fiscal polymasc currently has licenses with onyx pharmaceuticals and transkaryotic technologies 
on april  the company announced that it would consolidate all of its pegylation research activities from its facilities in london  england into its research center in the woodlands  texas 
the consolidation was substantially completed in september the company currently has prioritized its resources on its gene medicine and geneswitch platforms and has suspended research and development efforts on pegylation therapies 
however  the company continues to hold its pegylation intellectual property and is actively pursuing licensing and asset sales opportunities 
likewise  valentis continues to pursue its patent infringement proceedings against alza corporation which has been acquired by johnson johnson inc in the united states and sp labo nv  sp europe and essex pharma gmbh  all members of the schering plough group  in europe 
before a product can be successfully marketed  we  or our corporate partners  must fund the completion of preclinical studies  clinical studies and  if successfully completed  the market introduction of the new pegylated therapies 
product efficacy and dose responsiveness must be proven in phase ii and phase iii human clinical trials and fda approval is required before market introduction 
acquisition of genemedicine research and development programs we acquired seven primary gene medicine research and development programs in march prior to the merger of genemedicine with megabios in march  over the previous five years  genemedicine  inc incurred approximately million of research and development expenses in the development of these research and development programs 
the company currently has prioritized its resources on its gene medicine and geneswitch platforms and has suspended research and development efforts on other genemedicine  inc research and development programs like oncology 
however  the company continues to hold all of the intellectual property acquired in the genemedicine  inc merger  including the pegylation  and is actively pursuing licensing opportunities 
the company estimates that the cost to complete the eposwitch program  the intellectual property lead product in the development of geneswitch  could aggregate to approximately million over the next two years 
as a result of the mergers with genemedicine inc and polymasc  valentis focus became one of transforming its technologies into products 
at june   valentis had one clinical trial in progress for cardiovascular gene therapy 
if this clinical trial and subsequent clinical studies for our gene medicine products are successfully completed and if our corporate collaborators subsequently market the products  valentis will be entitled to receive royalties on the resulting product sales 
other acquired technology in april  valentis acquired rights and intellectual property related to the del gene and protein 
del is a novel extracellular matrix protein involved in early growth and development of blood vessels and bone that has been demonstrated to have potential application in the treatment of certain vascular diseases by stimulating angiogenesis 
the acquisition of del strengthens our product development in the area of cardiovascular disease 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas prohibits the use of the pooling of interest method for business combinations initiated after june  and also applies to all business combinations accounted for by the purchase method that are completed after june  there are also transition provisions that apply to business combinations completed before july   that were accounted for by the purchase method 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under sfas  amounts assigned to assembled workforce will be reclassified to goodwill and goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to a test for impairment on at least an annual basis 
the company will adopt sfas on july  as of june   the company had approximately  of goodwill  which will be subject to the new accounting rules 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets that is applicable to financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   with transition provisions for certain matters 
sfas supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
although retaining many of the fundamental recognition and measurement provisions of statement  the new rules significantly change the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
the new rules also will supersede the provisions of apb opinion with regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business and will require expected future operating losses from discontinued operation to be displayed in discontinued operations in the period s in which the losses are incurred rather than as of the measurement date as presently required 
the company will adopt sfas on july  and does not believe such adoption will have a material impact on its results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement supercedes eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the statement further establishes fair value as the objective for initial measurement of the liability and that employee benefit arrangements requiring future service beyond a minimum retention period be recognized over the future service period 
this statement is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the company is in the process of evaluating the financial statement impact  if any  of adoption of sfas no 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   valentis had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments compared to million at june  and million at june  net cash used in operations was million in  million in and million in cash was used primarily to fund research and development and general and administrative activities 
our capital expenditures were  in   in and  in valentis expects its capital expenditures to remain at current spending levels or be potentially lower to reflect the company s overall cost reduction plans and prioritization of its research and development efforts 
as discussed elsewhere in this report  including further below  we have received a report from our independent auditors covering the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  that includes an explanatory paragraph which states that the financial statements have been prepared assuming valentis will continue as a going concern 
the explanatory paragraph states the following conditions which raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern i we have incurred recurring operating losses since inception  including a net loss of million for the year ended june   and our accumulated deficit was million at june   ii our cash and investment balance at june  was million  and we had a net capital deficiency of million at june   and iii we have been notified that we have not complied with certain listing requirements of the nasdaq national market  and holders of our series a redeemable convertible preferred stock may require us to redeem their shares for cash if our common stock ceases to be listed on the nasdaq national market 
such redemption could aggregate up to million 
since its inception  valentis has financed its operations principally through public and private issuances of its common and preferred stock and funding from collaborative arrangements 
on december   valentis completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of its common stock for a total public offering price of million in new financing 
the proceeds after underwriting discounts  commissions and offering costs were million 
we have used and expect to continue to use the net proceeds from the sale of the common stock for general corporate purposes  which may include funding research  development and product manufacturing  increasing our working capital  reducing indebtedness  acquisitions or investments in businesses  products or technologies that are complementary to our own  and capital expenditures 
on december   we completed the private placement of  shares of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock  at a purchase price of  per share  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
in connection with the sale of the preferred stock  we issued common stock purchase warrants exercisable for up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock as compensation to certain series a preferred stockholders who acted as placement agents or financial advisors in the private transaction 
additional details associated with our december  private placement of series a preferred stock and warrants can be obtained from the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  or from the registration statement on form s file no 
filed with the securities and exchange commission on january  on april   valentis completed a private placement of  shares of newly issued common stock at per share  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
in october  we entered into an equipment financing agreement with a financing company 
we financed  in equipment purchases under this agreement structured as loans 
the equipment loans are being repaid over months at an interest rate of and are secured by the related equipment 
as of june   the outstanding balance under this financing agreement was  which will be fully repaid during fiscal year valentis has fully utilized the borrowing capacity under this agreement 
valentis leases its facilities under operating leases 
these leases expire between october and october with renewal options at the end of the initial terms of the facilities leases 
minimal annual rental commitments under the operating leases  excluding amounts to be received under subleases  and future minimum payments under the equipment loan agreement at june  are as follows in thousands year ended june  operating leases equipment loan total thereafter the company has experienced operating losses since its inception through june   including a net loss of million for the year ended june   and its accumulated deficit was million at june  the company expects such losses to continue into the foreseeable future as it proceeds with the research  development and commercialization of its technologies 
the company s cash  cash equivalents and investments decreased from million at june  to million at june  in addition  the company has been notified in august by the nasdaq staff that it has not complied with the listing requirements of the nasdaq national market 
as a result  holders of the company s series a redeemable convertible preferred stock series a preferred stock may require that the company redeem their shares for cash prior to the mandatory redemption date of this preferred stock if the company s common stock ceases to be listed on the nasdaq national market see note to consolidated financial statements 
if the holders of one series a preferred stock exercise their redemption rights  we will not have sufficient financial resources to satisfy those redemption obligations  which could aggregate up to million 
these circumstances have adversely affected the company s liquidity and raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern through june  the company will be required to seek additional sources of funding to complete development and commercialization of its products 
based upon the company s current operating plan  it anticipates that its cash  cash equivalents and investments  and projected interest income  will enable it to maintain its current and planned operations at least through march   in the absence of additional financial resources and assuming it is not required to redeem the series a preferred stock prior to its mandatory redemption date 
management believes that it can modify the company s operating plan to further reduce its currently planned level of operating expenses in order to have sufficient cash resources to operate through june  this modification to the company s operating plan  which would include a reduction in personnel  would require the company to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of its research and development programs and commercialization efforts or to relinquish greater or all rights to products at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than it would otherwise seek to obtain 
management believes these actions would adversely affect valentis business and its financial condition and results of operations 
the company is currently seeking additional collaborative agreements with corporate partners and may seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing 
the company may not be able to enter into any such agreements  however  or if entered into  any such agreements may not reduce or eliminate the company s requirements to seek additional funding 
additional financing to meet the company s funding requirements may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if the company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
with respect to the redemption rights of the series a preferred stock holders  the company is pursuing a number of options including among other actions  requesting waivers of such rights from the holders of the series a preferred stock and seeking to amend the terms of the series a preferred stock to eliminate all terms providing for cash redemption 
there can be no assurance that sufficient additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms  if at all  or that the company will be successful in regaining and maintaining compliance with the nasdaq national market listing requirements in order to prevent the exercise of the holders redemption rights 
if the company is unable to secure needed financing to continue operations or is unable to prevent its series a preferred stockholders from exercising their redemption rights  management plans to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of its research and development programs and commercialization efforts  and may be forced to discontinue operations prior to june  if the company s efforts to prevent the exercise of redemption rights by the holders of the series a preferred stock are not successful  the company will not have sufficient financial resources to satisfy these obligations 
we are pursuing strategic alternatives which may include the sale or merger of our business  sale of certain assets  seeking protection under bankruptcy laws or other actions 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the matters discussed above
