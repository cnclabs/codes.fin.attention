recent developments financing on march   we entered into an agreement which we subsequently amended and restated on march   with a group of investors led by abry mezzanine partners  lp to sell  shares of a new series of convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock for million 
pursuant to this agreement  we received gross proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of preferred stock and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock on march  we expect to close the remaining million within days of the initial closing 
a copy of the amended and restated series b convertible preferred stock and warrant purchase agreement and the certificate of designations and form of warrants agreements were filed with the securities and exchange commission on march  as exhibits to a current report on form k 
the following is a description of the material terms of the preferred stock and warrants and is qualified in its entirety by reference to that current report on form k and the applicable agreements 
significant terms of the new preferred stock are as follows holders of the preferred shares will have a liquidation preference over holders of common stock 
the initial liquidation value per share will be  if the preferred stock is not converted or redeemed prior to the sixth anniversary of the date of issuance  the liquidation value will increase to  per share if stockholder approval has been obtained on certain matters 
if the stockholder approval has not been obtained  the liquidation value will increase to  per share 
dividends accrue at an annual rate of from issuance until year six unless stockholder approval is obtained on certain matters  at which time the rate will decrease to per annum

after the sixth anniversary  dividends accrue at an annual rate of 
upon certain triggering events  the dividend rate may increase by one percentage point per quarter up to a maximum increase of five percentage points 
the dividends are payable semi annually in cash only if declared by our board of directors and approved by no less than of the convertible preferred stock then outstanding 
the provisions of our debt instruments limit our ability to pay dividends in cash  and we have no present intention to pay dividends in cash 
shares of preferred stock will be convertible at any time at each investor s option into a number of shares of our common stock equal to the liquidation value plus accrued but unpaid dividends  divided by the conversion price 
the conversion price will initially be  and is subject to certain anti dilution and other adjustments 
subject to certain restrictions  we have the option to convert the preferred stock at any time 
if stockholder approval of certain matters is not obtained by june   the conversion price will automatically be reduced by 
thereafter  until such approval is obtained  every days the conversion price will be reduced by of the conversion price then in effect 
in no event will the conversion price reduction related to the failure to timely obtain stockholder approval exceed of the conversion price that would have been in effect had we obtained stockholder approval 
upon our receipt of the stockholder approval  the conversion price will be readjusted as if no adjustments had occurred for failure to timely obtain stockholder approval 
if we fail to comply with specific covenants contained in the purchase agreement  the conversion price will be reduced by adjusted for stock splits and similar transactions 
the conversion price will readjust to what it would have been absent such breach once the breach is cured 
we may redeem the preferred stock at any time  in whole or in part  provided that the redemption price is equivalent to the amount the holders would receive on an as converted basis using a trailing day period and subject to certain minimum share prices based on the year redeemed 
the preferred stock initially entitles the holders to three seats on our board of directors 
upon the occurrence of certain triggering events  the holders may appoint up to one less than a minimum majority of our board of directors or a minimum majority upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency 
see further discussion of these triggering events in risk factors 
the holders of the convertible preferred stock are entitled to vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our common stockholders 
we have agreed to register the common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible preferred stock and exercise of the warrants within days after closing and use our best efforts to have the registration statement declared effective within days 
the terms of the convertible preferred stock subject us to various covenants  which among other things  limits our ability to sell assets  make any restricted payments or restricted investments  enter into various agreements and grant certain options 
warrants will be issued to purchase an additional million shares of our common stock 
all warrants will have an initial exercise price of per share  subject to certain anti dilution and other adjustments that mirror those applicable to the convertible preferred stock 
the warrants are immediately exercisable and expire years after issuance 
we are currently studying the accounting for this transaction  including the provisions of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
net proceeds from the sale of the preferred stock  along with the net proceeds of million from our recent sale of our int media group  inc common stock and cash on hand from our million tax refund  will be used to repay million of amounts outstanding under our term loans 
on march   simultaneously with the payment discussed above  we also amended our credit facility 
if we were required to file our compliance certificate prior to the amendment of the credit facility  we would not have been in compliance with some of our financial covenants 
the amended and restated facility provides  among other things  the following the revolving credit facility was permanently reduced to million from million 
we were relieved of our financial covenants at december  and march  revised financial covenant requirements after march  have been established 
for example  our leverage ratio and fixed charge ratio covenants are not applicable until after june  and september   respectively 
the revolver is limited to million until the leverage ratio is less than x or the term loans have been prepaid in full 
an additional million will become available in the event that not less than million is raised from an equity issuance and the proceeds are used to prepay the term loans 
upon receipt of the second quarter compliance certificate  an additional million will become available 
in order to access the revolver  the company must not have more than million of cash and cash equivalents available and must be in compliance with the loan documents 
the amendment also increased the interest rate on the revolver as well as the term a and term b loans  places additional restrictions on certain payments  limits additional debt and contingent obligations  requires additional collateral  limits additional acquisitions and investments  limits our ability to sell assets and limits capital expenditures 
expense reduction and restructuring initiatives in  we implemented a number of expense reduction and restructuring initiatives to more closely align our cost structure with the current business environment 
the cost reduction initiatives included workforce reductions  elimination of unprofitable properties  significant reductions in capital spending  the shutdown and consolidation of certain facilities and other cost reductions 
specific actions taken  most of which occurred in the second half of  are as follows we reduced staffing by nearly positions through terminations 
we imposed a company wide hiring freeze  as well as a salary freeze for higher paid employees  until we return to profitability 
we shut down and consolidated more than offices worldwide 
we reduced benefit costs by increasing employee contributions for health care and temporarily suspending the company match for our defined contribution plan  and we eliminated year end discretionary bonuses 
we eliminated unprofitable properties  including seven magazines  more than events and nearly web sites 
we reduced the production cost of various under performing magazines through process improvements  automation of pre press work  new printing and paper supply contracts  and selective reduction in frequency and circulation levels 
we restructured various under performing events by either eliminating these events or by co locating with other events and realigning management structures 
we implemented a plan to centralize all information technology services 
we effectively outsourced various corporate and division functions 
as part of the expense reduction and restructuring initiatives  we recorded a restructuring charge in of approximately million 
the majority of the charge relate to office closings costs  such as future lease obligations  and employee severance costs 
impairment of assets in connection with an ongoing review of our portfolio of businesses and in conjunction with our policy to continually monitor events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying amount of our long lived assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  may not be recoverable  we recorded asset and goodwill impairment charges of million in this charge primarily consists of the following goodwill and other intangibles of million were written down to estimated fair value 
we recognized asset impairments of million on various web sites that were shut down during the year 
circulation software costs of million were written off subsequent to a management decision to discontinue the development of the software and to outsource that function 
segments during  we began to view and manage our business differently than we had in the past 
our new approach involves dividing our business into four media segments  technology  industry  lifestyle and other  and grouping our industry sectors within each segment 
during  we put a senior manager in charge of each segment 
these senior managers report directly to the chief executive officer and president and chief operating officer 
we have included segment information in our discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for on the same basis as it was not practicable to obtain similar segment information for as a result of refinements made to our accounting systems and procedures beginning in see further discussion in note segment information 
results of operations the following table sets forth our statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues operating expenses editorial  production and circulation selling  general and administrative impairment of internet assets impairment of other assets restructuring charge depreciation and amortization operating income loss other income expense interest expense  net of interest earned gain on sale of investments writedown of internet investments miscellaneous  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations income loss before extraordinary item extraordinary item early extinguishment of debt net income loss comparison of and total company in the analysis that follows  we have used adjusted ebitda  which we define as net income before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and unusual items  as the primary measure of profitability in evaluating our operations and we believe that investors find it to be a useful tool for measuring a company s ability to generate cash 
adjusted ebitda does not represent cash flow from operations  as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  and is not calculated in the same way by all companies 
in addition  you should not consider adjusted ebitda a substitute for net income or net loss  or as an indicator of our operating performance or cash flow  or as a measure of liquidity 
adjusted ebitda margin equals adjusted ebitda divided by total revenues 
our definition of adjusted ebitda is principally calculated in the same manner as ebitda under our credit facility  except that the loan covenant ebitda is on a rolling four quarter basis and allows for the shift in timing of events between quarters 
our revenues  net income loss  adjusted ebitda  diluted earnings per share and adjusted ebitda margins for the years ended december  and were as follows change revenues    net income loss    adjusted ebitda    earnings per common share diluted ebitda margins operating results for the year ended december  were severely impacted by the downturn in the us economy and  to a lesser extent  by the slowing of economies throughout europe and asia 
in particular  results for the fourth quarter of  during which four of our largest trade shows took place  were also adversely impacted by reductions in customers travel and marketing spending following the terrorist attacks of september  our technology and manufacturing media portfolios  particularly trade shows and publishing properties serving the internet broadband sector  experienced the deepest business decline throughout  particularly in the second half of the year 
our revenues decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in publishing revenues of million  or  from million in to million in  as well as a decrease in trade show and conference revenues of million  or  from million in to million in these decreases were offset in part by an increase in online media revenue of million  from million in to million in we reported a net loss for of million  or per diluted share  compared with income of million  or per diluted share  in excluding unusual items  our net loss was million  or per diluted share  in  compared with income of million  or per diluted share  in unusual items in included restructuring charges of million or per diluted share after tax related to the discontinuation of certain unprofitable media properties  staff reductions and facility closings  and non cash charges of million or per diluted share after tax related primarily to goodwill writedowns 
unusual items in included a pre tax gain of million per diluted share after tax on our sale of int media group inc common stock and investment writedowns and asset impairments of million per diluted share after tax 
total adjusted ebitda decreased million  or  from million in to million in adjusted ebitda margins decreased from in to in the decrease in both our adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margins was due primarily to a decrease in the adjusted ebitda for our publishing operations of million  or  from million in to million in  a decrease in the adjusted ebitda for our trade show and conference operations of million  or  from million in to million in  and an increase in our general and administrative costs of million  from million in to million in the decreases in the adjusted ebitda were somewhat offset by an increase in the adjusted ebitda for our online media operations of million  from a loss of million in to a loss of million in a reconciliation of our net income loss to our total adjusted ebitda is as follows in thousands year ended december  net income loss   interest expense  net of interest earned   gain on sale of investments  restructuring charge  provision benefit for income taxes   impairment of internet assets  depreciation and amortization   writedown of internet investments  impairment of other assets   discontinued operations  net of taxes miscellaneous  net  adjusted ebitda   operating expenses editorial  production and circulation total editorial  production and circulation expenses grew to million in compared with million in  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase was due primarily to a full year of operations for the acquisitions completed in  including professional trade shows  streaming media  duke and communic  as well as the acquisitions completed in  including hillgate and dwr 
these increases were somewhat offset by the shutdown of our healthwell 
com exchange in february  and our decision not to hold internet world summer and internet world canada shows in editorial  production and circulation expenses increased as a percentage of revenues from in to in the increase was due largely to lower revenues for both magazines and trade shows 
selling  general and administrative total selling  general and administrative expenses grew million  or  from million in to million in  primarily due to higher selling costs 
during the first half of  our spending on marketing and selling increased at a higher rate for trade shows than in the previous year 
general and administrative costs increased due to the impact of professional trade shows  duke and streaming media acquisitions in september and higher health benefit costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues from in to in the increase was due largely to lower revenues for both magazines and trade shows 
impairment of assets triggered by the continued decline in the economy and the negative impact of the september  events which further weakened an already deteriorating business climate  we recorded asset and goodwill impairment charges of million million after tax  or per diluted share in the second half of in addition to goodwill writedowns of million  the remaining charge primarily represents assets of million related to various web sites that were shut down and million related to abandoned circulation software costs 
asset impairment charges of million in the third quarter included the writedown of goodwill by million on five small acquisitions  million for various web sites that were shut down  and million of abandoned circulation software costs 
asset impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter included primarily the writedown of goodwill related to eight acquisitions 
in december  we wrote off million of impaired assets related to certain internally funded internet media initiatives 
the impaired assets related to certain abandoned projects 
in addition  we recorded approximately a million non cash charge in to write down the carrying value of certain leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  and computer equipment to fair value 
restructuring charge in the second half of  we implemented a number of expense reduction and restructuring initiatives to more closely align our cost structure with the current business environment 
as a result  in the third quarter  we recorded restructuring charges of million million after tax  or per share on a diluted basis and in the fourth quarter  we recorded restructuring charges of million million after tax  or per share on a diluted basis 
the restructuring charge resulted primarily from strategic decisions to restructure a number of businesses and support departments  including reducing our overhead infrastructure by consolidating and closing several branch offices  centralizing information technology and outsourcing certain corporate functions 
of the total charges  million related to employee termination benefits and the remaining million related to non cancelable obligations under continuing contracts 
see note business restructuring and other charges for additional information on related cash payments 
the following sets forth additional detail concerning the principal components of the charge personnel costs of million are associated primarily with the elimination of nearly positions  of which positions and payments of million were completed at year end 
approximately of the positions eliminated or to be eliminated are in the us  with the remaining positions predominantly in the united kingdom and germany 
personnel costs include payments for severance  outplacement services and a provision for continued benefits to personnel 
office closure costs of million relate to the closure of over penton offices worldwide and include costs associated with existing office spaces under lease 
in february  we announced a restructuring program with the intent of discontinuing online media operations that have not demonstrated revenue growth  customer acceptance and near term opportunity for profit 
the charge of million million after tax  or per share on a basic and diluted basis included the write off of capitalized software development costs associated with the discontinuance of the industry exchange component of new hope natural media s healthwell 
com  personnel costs  including the reduction in workforce of approximately employees at healthwell 
com  and a reduction in workforce related to a number of other internet initiatives throughout penton  and exit costs associated with existing office spaces under lease and other contractual obligations 
in the third quarter of  we determined that some first quarter restructuring initiatives would not require the level of spending that had been originally estimated and approximately million was reversed 
the majority of the remaining costs incurred in connection with the first quarter restructuring plan have been paid 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million  or  from million in to million in the higher expense was primarily the result of a full year of amortization of goodwill and other intangibles associated with pts  duke and streaming media  which were all acquired in september of  as well as increased depreciation associated with capital expenditures related to the corporate headquarters relocation in the fourth quarter of other income expense interest expense increased million to million due to a higher average debt balance outstanding in compared with  as well as a significant decrease in interest earned on available cash in compared with the increase was somewhat offset by lower overall interest rates in compared with in february  penton sold million shares of int media group inc common stock as part of a million share secondary offering 
penton received cash of million and recognized a pre tax gain of approximately million 
in july  penton sold approximately million shares of int media group inc common stock and recognized a pre tax gain of approximately million 
in  the company invested million in cayenta inc  a total service provider of end to end e commerce systems  and million in leisurehub 
com  an online business to business trading community for the global leisure industry 
during  the company determined that its investments in these internet related companies had suffered declines in value that were other than temporary 
as a result  the company recognized losses totaling million  reducing its investment in cayenta inc and leisurehub 
com to zero 
in  we received partial liquidation proceeds from leisurehub of million 
miscellaneous net expense increased to million in  due primarily to minority equity interests and various professional fees related to unsuccessful potential acquisitions that were written off during the year 
effective tax rates the effective tax rates from continuing operations were a benefit of and provision of for and  respectively 
the decrease in our effective tax rate is due primarily to our writedown of non deductible goodwill in segments we manage our business based on four operating segments technology media  industry media  lifestyle media and other media 
all four segments derive their revenues from the production of publications  trade shows and conferences  and online media products  and serve customers in industry sectors 
adjusted ebitda for segments is calculated as previously defined except that segment adjusted ebitda also excludes corporate level costs 
corporate level costs include costs for centralized functions  such as finance  accounting and information systems  which cannot be reasonably allocated to each segment 
see note segment information  for a reconciliation of segment total adjusted ebitda to consolidated income loss before taxes

total revenues for the industry media segment decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was due primarily to year over year declines across much of the segment s portfolio  which was primarily affected by the slowing economy  with industryweek  machine design  american machinist  new equipment digest  contracting business and material handling managementmagazines showing the largest revenue decreases 
these declines were somewhat offset by i revenue generated by medical design news magazine  which we launched during the year  ii added revenues from contractor magazine  which we acquired in the second quarter of the year  iii the first full year of results of professional trade shows  which was acquired in september  and iv year on year revenue growth in the segment s online media business

the industry media segment s online media portfolio experienced a modest decline in compared with technology media our technology media segment serves customers in the electronics  information technology and internet broadband industry sectors 
total revenues for technology media decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was due primarily to declines in our internet world spring  ispcon spring  streaming media west and internet world fall trade shows  which were caused by the slowdown in the us economy and the events of september  revenue declines were offset in part by i added results of the streaming media and communic trade show properties  which were acquired in  ii added results of duke publications and online media products  which were acquired in  iii several events launched in the year and iv added results of the wireless developer conference  which was acquired in total adjusted ebitda for technology media decreased million  or  from million in to million in adjusted ebitda margins decreased from in to in adjusted ebitda declines mirrored revenue trends for technology media publishing  trade shows and conferences and online media products 
overall  results were severely impacted by the decline in the technology market and the events of september  the internet world fall show  originally scheduled for early october at the jacob k 
javits convention center in new york city  had to be rescheduled to december  which impacted attendance 
other fourth quarter shows were impacted by the slowdown in travel and fear of additional attacks 
lifestyle media our lifestyle media segment serves customers in the natural products industry sector 
total revenues for lifestyle media decreased million  or  from million in to million in lifestyle media incurred revenue declines in its publishing and online media products  which were offset in part by increases from trade show events and added properties 
revenues from the natural foods merchandiser  new product review and nutrition science news declined year over year 
these declines were offset in part by the added results from nutrition business journal  which we acquired in february trade show and conference revenues grew compared with for natural products expo west and natural products expo europe  however  revenues for nhm expo east  held in early october in washington  dc  were impacted by travel slowdowns and fear of additional attacks after the events of september  total adjusted ebitda for lifestyle media increased million  or  from million in to million in adjusted ebitda margins increased from in to in the increase was due primarily to the shutdown in of the healthwell 
com industry exchange 
other media our other media segment serves customers in the food retail and leisure hospitality industry sectors 
total revenues for other media decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was due primarily to year over year declines for convenience store decisions  restaurant hospitality and lodging hospitality magazines and for the international leisure industry week show caused primarily by the slow down in the global economy 
total adjusted ebitda for other media decreased million  or  from million in to million in adjusted ebitda declines followed revenue declines for the publications noted 
results of the international leisure industry week show held in october were impacted by the economic slowdown in european markets and travel concerns caused by the september terrorist attacks 
products we publish specialized trade magazines  produce trade shows and conferences  and maintain a variety of online media products  including web businesses and more than electronic newsletters  which serve each of the industries in our four business segments 
adjusted ebitda for products is calculated as previously defined except that product adjusted ebitda also excludes general and administrative costs 
general and administrative costs include corporate level costs as defined above and other general and administrative costs related to product offerings which cannot be reasonably allocated 
our calculation of adjusted ebitda by product is as follows in thousands year ended december  publishing   trade shows and conferences   online media   general and administrative   adjusted ebitda   adjusted ebitda for our publishing operations decreased million  or  from million in to million in adjusted ebitda decreases for our publishing operations were due primarily to the general slowdown in the us economy  which most heavily impacted magazines in our technology  electronics and manufacturing sectors

javits convention center in new york city in early october  but had to be rescheduled to december because of the events of september  other shows held during the fourth quarter of were also impacted by the slowdown in travel and fear of additional attacks

these improvements were offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization related to acquisitions and the impairment of internet and other assets 
editorial  production and circulation total editorial  production and circulation expenses grew to million in compared with million in  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase was due primarily to a full year of operations for the acquisitions completed during  including new hope  stardust and nutracon  as well as the acquisitions of professional trade shows  streaming media and duke in september increases were also due to costs associated with trade shows held for the first time in  such as the internet everywhere ceo summit and the clec expo fall show  as well as costs related to the biennial fluid power handbook directory  which was published in and not in as a percentage of revenues  editorial  production and circulation expenses decreased from in to in the decrease was due largely to higher margins earned from trade shows

the decrease in operating cash flows in compared with was due primarily to the decrease in operating income by million  after excluding non cash charges 
the most significant working capital changes in were attributable to accounts receivable  income taxes receivable  accounts payable  accrued expenses  and unearned income 
the accounts receivable decrease reflects lower fourth quarter sales in compared with and the timing of payments received 
the receivable for income taxes reflects the losses incurred in and our ability to carry these losses back to previous years to obtain a refund 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses was due primarily to the timing of vendor and other payments  which can fluctuate based on when particular shows are held  and the decrease in unearned income is due primarily to the timing of vendor payments and related shows  and the decrease in the volume of expected business in the decrease in operating cash flows in compared with was due primarily to an increase in operating income of million offset by changes in working capital items and to increases in income tax payments required in these payments were attributable largely to the increase in operating income and the million gain realized in from the sale of int media group inc stock

investing activities used million in  primarily for acquisitions including new hope and capital expenditures  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of our printing segment and the sale of approximately million shares of int media group  inc stock 
financing activities provided million in  primarily from the issuance of our senior subordinated notes and amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility

the company had a working capital deficit of million at december  we expect that consummation of the sale of the convertible preferred stock and warrants as described below and the subsequent paydown of debt  along with proceeds from operations  will be sufficient to overcome this deficit 
set forth below  in tabular form  is information as of december  for the periods indicated concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments under long term obligations in thousands less than after total year years years years long term debt      capital lease obligation operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations     total      in may  we completed the sale of million shares of common stock and received net proceeds of approximately million  which were used to repay senior debt and for general corporate purposes  including the acquisition of new hope 
on september   we entered into a million credit agreement with several banks 
the agreement provided for a revolving credit facility of up to million  a term loan of million and a term loan b of million 
the proceeds of this credit agreement were used to repay our debt outstanding under the million credit facility obtained when we purchased mecklermedia 
at december   we had million outstanding under our term loans and million available under our revolving credit facility 
on april   we amended our credit facility to give us the flexibility to sell assets of up to million and to monetize our joint venture investments 
in october  we amended our credit facility to give us the ability to increase our term loan a facility  term loan b facility and or revolving credit facility up to an aggregate of million prior to september  at that time  we increased the commitment under the revolving credit facility by million to million 
the remaining million could not be requested on more than three separate occasions  and any increase had to take place by september  we did not exercise this option 
as described in the following paragraphs  we have entered into an amendment to our credit facility 
if we were required to file our credit facility compliance certificate prior to the amendment of the credit facility  we would not have been in compliance with our financial covenants 
in june  we issued million of senior subordinated notes due june  to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a of the securities act 
interest is payable on the notes semi annually  on june and december of each year 
the notes are guaranteed  on a senior subordinated basis  by our domestic subsidiaries  and may be redeemed on or after june  in addition  we may redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes before june  with the proceeds of certain equity offerings 
the notes were offered at a discount of million to be amortized over the term of the notes 
amortization of the discount was not material in costs representing underwriting fees and other professional fees of million will be amortized over the term of the notes 
net proceeds of million were used to pay down the million outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility  million of the term loan a facility and million of the term loan b facility 
the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
the notes are our unsecured senior subordinated obligations  subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness  including the credit facility 
the notes contain covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to borrow money  pay dividends on or repurchase capital stock  make investments  sell assets  or enter into mergers or consolidations 
in january  we received million in net proceeds from the sale of our remaining investment in int media group  inc common stock 
in february  we received a tax refund of approximately million 
for federal income tax purposes we were allowed to carry back losses we incurred in to previous tax years 
on march   simultaneously with the receipt of million of proceeds from the convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock as noted in the next paragraph  we amended our credit facility 
as amended  the credit facility consists of a revolving credit facility with a maximum availability of million 
the amendment also eliminates the financial covenant requirements for december  and march  and provides revised covenants for the remainder of and on march   we entered into an agreement  which was subsequently amended and restated on march   with a group of investors led by abry mezzanine partners  lp to sell  shares of a new series of convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock for million 
we received gross proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of preferred stock and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock on march  we expect to close the remaining million within days of the initial closing 
net proceeds from the sale of the preferred stock  along with the net proceeds of million from our recent sale of our int media group  inc common stock and cash on hand from our tax refund of million  were used to repay million of amounts outstanding under our term loans 
based upon current and anticipated levels of operations  we believe that cash on hand and cash flow from operations  combined with the borrowing capacity under our credit facilities  will be sufficient to enable us to meet current and anticipated cash operating requirements  including scheduled interest and principal payments  capital expenditures and working capital needs 
however  actual capital requirements may change 
our ability to meet current and anticipated operating requirements will depend upon our future performance  which  in turn  will be subject to general economic conditions and to financial  competitive  business and other factors  including factors beyond our control 
if we are unable to meet our debt obligations or fund our other liquidity needs  we may be required to raise additional capital through additional financing arrangements or the issuance of private or public debt or equity securities 
we cannot assure you that such additional financing will be available at acceptable terms 
in addition  the terms of our convertible preferred stock and warrants issued  including the conversion price  dividend and liquidation adjustments provisions that could result in substantial dilution to stockholders  the redemption price premiums and board representation rights  could negatively impact our ability to access the equity markets in the future 
seasonality the majority of our trade shows and conferences are held in the second and fourth quarters and  accordingly  the majority of our revenue is recognized in these quarters 
we may also experience seasonal fluctuations as trade shows and conferences held in one period in the current year may be held in a different period in future years 
inflation the impact of inflation on our results of operations has not been significant in recent years 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are allowance for doubtful accounts  asset impairment and income tax accounting 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our review of our long lived assets and goodwill and other intangibles requires us to initially estimate the undiscounted future cash flow of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
if such analysis indicates that a possible impairment may exist  we are required to then estimate the fair value of the asset  principally determined either by third party appraisals  sales price negotiations or estimated discounted future cash flows  which includes making estimates of the timing of the future cash flows  discount rates and reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk 
the determination of fair value includes numerous uncertainties  unless a viable  actively traded market exists for the asset  which is not always the case 
significant judgments are made concerning future growth rates  interest and discount rates  terminal values  continued consumer demand for particular products  and any future effects of governmental regulations or competition 
our estimated cash flows are based on historical results and transactions adjusted to reflect the best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
if these estimates or their underlying assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for these assets 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
it is our policy to record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
increases in the valuation allowance result in additional expenses to be reflected within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
different assumptions as to the future expected results of our operation could lead to additional charges 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
we were required to adopt this statement in the first quarter of in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas deferred the effective date of adoption of sfas to all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas was subsequently amended by sfas  accounting for certain derivative and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
we adopted this statement effective january  see note hedging activities 
in july  the fas board issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
in addition  this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination at acquisition 
the statement also provides criteria for the separate recognition of intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
sfas no 
is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for intangible assets acquired individually or with a group of other assets at acquisition 
sfas no 
presumes that goodwill and certain intangible assets have indefinite useful lives 
accordingly  goodwill and certain intangibles will not be amortized  but rather will be tested at least annually for impairment 
sfas no 
also addresses accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we anticipate that the adoption of this statement will lead to the elimination of approximately million of goodwill amortization in we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the other provisions of this statement 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
although retaining many of the fundamental recognition and measurement provisions of sfas no 
 there are a number of changes including the removal of goodwill from its scope 
the statement also retains the basic provision of abp opinion no 
however  for long lived assets held for sale  this statement introduces the components of an entity rather than a segment of a business approach to determine discontinued operations 
a component of an entity has clearly distinguishable operating and financial reporting practices 
we do not expect this statement to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
euro conversion on january   the introduction of the single european currency  the euro  was completed with the launch of euro bank notes and coins as legal currency within of the member states of the european union 
businesses in participating countries will conduct transactions in the euro and must convert their financial records and reports to be euro based 
although we generate revenues in some of the participating countries  we do not anticipate that the conversion to the euro will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in the normal course of business  we manage fluctuations in interest rates through interest rate derivative agreements and  at a minimum  hedge of the current outstanding term loans maintained as floating rate borrowings 
our objective in managing this exposure is to reduce fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in interest rates 
see note fair value of financial instruments 
we maintain assets and operations in europe and asia and  as a result  may be exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency rates relative to the markets in which we sell 
for  a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar relative to the currencies of foreign countries in which we operate created only an immaterial impact on our financial results
