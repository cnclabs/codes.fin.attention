item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are primarily engaged in the research  development  manufacture and commercialization of targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases 
in february  we received fda approval to market our second product  zevalin  in the united states 
we will market zevalin as one product which will be comprised of two components  an imaging component for use with indium and a therapeutic component for use with yttrium we have retained all us marketing and distribution rights to zevalin and have granted marketing and distribution rights outside the us to schering ag 
in january  the emea accepted for filing the zevalin maa  submitted by schering ag in the european union 
in march  the summary of product characteristics was approved by the european cpmp for the treatment of adult patients with rituximab relapsed or refractory cd follicular b cell nhl 
the cpmp s final approval is pending and subject to a gmp inspection at dsm pharmaceuticals 
our product rituxan is being copromoted in the united states under a joint business arrangement with genentech  where we receive a share of the pretax copromotion profits 
under the copromotion arrangement we share responsibility with genentech for the sale and continued development of rituxan in the united states 
continued development of rituxan includes conducting supportive research on rituxan  post approval clinical studies and obtaining potential approval of rituxan for additional indications 
genentech provides the support functions for the commercialization of rituxan in the united states including marketing  customer service  order entry  distribution  shipping and billing 
since september  genentech has been responsible for all worldwide manufacturing of rituxan 
since the transfer of the manufacturing of rituxan to genentech  we have been using our manufacturing capacity for production of specification setting lots and pre commercial inventory of zevalin antibodies and production of other proteins for clinical trials 
under the terms of separate agreements with genentech  roche is responsible for the commercialization of rituxan outside the united states  except in japan where it continues development and copromotes rituxan in collaboration with zenyaku 
we receive royalties on rituxan sales outside the united states 
our revenues include revenues from unconsolidated joint business  contract revenues and license fees 
until the commercialization of rituxan  a substantial portion of our revenues had been derived from contract revenues and license fees 
however  since the commercialization of rituxan in november  our revenues have depended primarily upon the sale of rituxan 
we have incurred increasing annual operating expenses and  with the commercialization of rituxan and zevalin  we expect these trends to continue 
since our inception in  through  we incurred annual operating losses 
our ongoing profitability will be dependent upon the continued commercial success of rituxan  the commercial success of zevalin  if successful  product development  revenues from the achievement of product development objectives and licensing transactions 
as of december   we had retained earnings of million 
critical accounting principles and estimates in response to the securities and exchange commission s release numbers cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies and  commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for income taxes including the related valuation allowance  accruals for compensation and related benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we explain these accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from unconsolidated joint business include our share of the pretax copromotion profits generated from our copromotion arrangement with genentech  revenue from bulk rituxan sales to genentech through march  reimbursement from genentech of our rituxan related sales force and development expenses and royalty revenue from roche on sales of rituximab outside the united states 
revenue from bulk rituxan sales was recognized when genentech accepted the bulk rituxan 
under the copromotion arrangement  all us sales of rituxan and associated costs and expenses are recognized by genentech and we record our share of the pretax copromotion profits on a quarterly basis  as defined in our collaborative agreement with genentech 
pretax copromotion profits under the copromotion arrangement are derived by taking us net sales of rituxan to third party customers less cost of sales  third party royalty expenses  distribution  selling and marketing expenses and joint development expenses incurred by genentech and us 
contract revenues include nonrefundable research and development funding under collaborative agreements with our strategic partners and other funding under contractual arrangements with other parties 
contract research and development funding generally compensates us for discovery  preclinical and clinical expenses related to our collaborative development programs for our products and is recognized at the time research and development activities are performed under the terms of the collaborative agreements 
license fees include nonrefundable fees from product development milestone payments and nonrefundable fees from the sale of product rights under collaborative development and license agreements with our strategic partners 
nonrefundable up front fees from the sale of product rights are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and recognized as revenue over future periods as required by the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab no 
included in license fees are nonrefundable product development milestone payments which are recognized upon the achievement of product development milestone objectives as stipulated in agreements with our strategic partners 
product development milestone objectives vary in each of our agreements 
the achievement of product development milestone objectives that may lead to the recognition of license fee revenues include the achievement of preclinical research and development objectives  the initiation of various phases of clinical trials  the filing of an ind application  bla or nda  the filing of drug license applications in foreign territories  and obtaining united states or foreign regulatory product approvals 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we may include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating loss carryforwards  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
our estimates of taxable income are derived from  among other items  our estimates of deductions related to stock options 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  was million  net of a valuation allowance of million 
results of operations revenues from unconsolidated joint business revenues from unconsolidated joint business for the years ended december   and  consist of the following table in thousands copromotion profits    bulk rituxan sales   reimbursement of selling and development expenses   royalty revenue on sales of rituximab outside the us   during the first quarter of  we recognized the remaining revenues and related manufacturing costs from bulk rituxan sales to genentech 
under our agreement with genentech  our pretax copromotion profit sharing formula has two tiers 
we earn a higher percentage of the pretax copromotion profits at the upper tier once a fixed pretax copromotion profit level is met 
the profit sharing formula resets annually at the beginning of each year to the lower tier 
we began recording our profit share at the higher percentage during the first quarter of compared to the beginning of the second quarter of in  we began recording our profit share at the higher percentage during the second quarter 
rituxan net sales to third party customers in the united states recorded by genentech for amounted to million compared to million in and million in the increase in was primarily due to increased market penetration in treatments of b cell nhl and ccl and a three percent increase in the wholesale price of rituxan in march the increase in was primarily due to increased market penetration in treatments of b cell nhl and a five percent increase in the wholesale price of rituxan in may our royalty revenue on sales of rituximab outside the us is based on roche s end user sales and is recorded with a one quarter lag 
contract revenues contract revenues totaled million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in contract revenues in resulted primarily from decreased funding under our collaboration and license agreement with schering ag  partially offset by increased funding under our collaborative development agreement with mitsubishi 
the increase in contract revenues in compared to was primarily the result of funding under our collaboration and license agreement with schering ag and our collaborative research and development agreement with taisho  partially offset by the decreased funding under a collaborative agreement with eisai 
license fees license fees totaled million in compared to million in and million in license fees in consist primarily of payments received from eisai and revenue from schering ag that was previously recognized in  see cumulative effect of accounting change below  for the achievement of product development milestone objectives  and the receipt of a million milestone payment from schering ag when the emea accepted for filing the submission of a maa for approval of zevalin in europe 
license fees in consisted solely of revenue from schering ag that was previously recognized in  see cumulative effect of accounting change below 
license fees in consisted primarily of a million up front licensing fee from schering ag for the development and commercialization of zevalin outside the united states 
contract revenues and license fees may vary from year to year and are  in part  dependent upon achievement of research and development objectives or the consummation of new corporate alliances 
the magnitude and timing of contract revenues and license fees may influence our achievement and level of profitability 
we continue to pursue other collaborative and license arrangements  however  we cannot assure you that any of these arrangements will be realized 
manufacturing costs there were no manufacturing costs recorded for compared to million in and million in our manufacturing costs recorded in related to production of bulk rituxan sold to genentech and were recognized when genentech accepted the bulk rituxan inventory 
the decrease in manufacturing costs in from was due to the transfer of all worldwide manufacturing responsibilities for bulk rituxan to genentech in september the final lots of bulk rituxan manufactured by us during the third quarter of were accepted by genentech during the first quarter of since the transfer of all worldwide manufacturing responsibilities for bulk rituxan to genentech  and prior to receiving fda approval for zevalin in february  we used our manufacturing capacity for production of specification setting lots and pre commercial inventory of zevalin antibodies and production of other proteins for clinical trials 
those manufacturing expenses have been recorded as research and development expenses 
manufacturing costs are expected to increase in the future due to commercialization of zevalin 
research and development research and development expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in the increase in research and development expenses in is primarily due to increased clinical testing of our various products under development  development costs for zevalin  personnel expenses and expansion of our facilities 
the increase in research and development expenses in from was primarily due to zevalin related manufacturing and process development expenses  technology in licensing and expansion of our facilities 
in the future we expect to continue incurring substantial additional research and development expenses due to continuing development programs for zevalin  the expansion or addition of research and development programs  technology in licensing  regulatory related expenses  the expansion of clinical manufacturing capabilities  facilities expansion  and preclinical and clinical testing of our various products under development 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in selling  general and administrative expenses increased in primarily due to increased marketing and administrative expenses related to the commercialization of zevalin  sales expenses to support rituxan  legal expenses to defend zevalin patent issues and general increases in general and administrative expenses to support overall organizational growth 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in primarily due to increased legal and patent filing fees and increases in sales and marketing expenses resulting from the commercialization of rituxan 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in the foreseeable future to support the following expanded growth of our sales force  marketing and administration related to the commercialization of zevalin  manufacturing capacity  clinical trials  research and development  and legal fees to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights for zevalin and our product candidates 
interest income expense interest income totaled million in compared to million in and million in the increase in interest income in and is primarily due to higher average balances in cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale resulting from the sale of million shares of common stock in november  cash provided by operations and cash provided from the issuance of common stock under employee stock option and purchase plans 
the average interest rates earned on our investments in decreased from the average interest rates earned on our investments in as a result of declining market interest rates 
interest expense totaled million in compared to million in and million in the increase in interest expense in and is primarily due to noncash interest charges relating to the convertible promissory notes offering in february interest expense is expected to increase in the future due to noncash interest charges from our convertible promissory notes 
income tax provision our effective tax rate in was approximately compared to percent in and five percent in the increase in our effective tax rate for primarily resulted from changes in the valuation allowance that resulted in a lower tax rate in our tax rate for differed from a normal statutory rate due to the generation of research and development tax credits 
the tax rate of in is higher than the comparable tax rate of five percent in due to greater changes in valuation allowance in than in our net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income at december  were approximately million for federal income tax purposes and begin to expire in the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be subject to an annual limitation under the internal revenue code due to a cumulative change of ownership of more than in prior years 
however  we anticipate this annual limitation to result only in a slight deferral in the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
cumulative effect of accounting change in the fourth quarter of  we implemented sab no 
 which became effective as of january  sab no 
established new guidelines in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
provides that nonrefundable up front fees received under collaborative agreements be recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and recognized as revenue over future periods 
prior to the implementation of sab no 
 we recognized certain nonrefundable up front fees upon receipt as license fee revenue 
the cumulative effect of this accounting change on years prior to resulted in a charge of million net of a million income tax effect  that was reflected effectively in the first quarter of  of which million and million was recognized as license fee revenue in and  respectively 
this accounting change is directly related to the million up front license fee received from schering ag and recognized as license fee revenue in liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operating and capital expenditures since inception principally through sales of equity securities  profits from our copromotion arrangement with genentech related to the sales of rituxan  license fees  contract revenues  lease financing transactions  debt financing transactions and interest income 
we expect to finance our current and planned operating requirements principally through cash on hand  anticipated funds from our copromotion arrangement with genentech  anticipated funds from commercial sales of zevalin and with funds from existing collaborative agreements and contracts 
we believe that these funds will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
existing collaborative research agreements and contracts  however  could be canceled by the contracting parties 
in addition  we may  from time to time seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements  strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources 
additional funds may not be obtainable through these sources on acceptable terms if at all 
if adequate funds are not available from the copromotion arrangement  operations or additional sources of financing  our business could be harmed 
our working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the continued commercial success of rituxan  the commercial success of zevalin  timing and expense of obtaining regulatory approvals  financing alternatives available for the construction of our large scale manufacturing facilities and corporate headquarters and research and development campus  the progress of our preclinical and clinical testing  fluctuating or increasing manufacturing requirements and research and development programs  levels of resources that we devote to the development of manufacturing  sales and marketing capabilities  including resources devoted to the commercial launch of zevalin  technological advances  status of competitors  and our ability to establish collaborative arrangements with other organizations 
until required for operations  we invest our cash reserves in bank deposits  certificates of deposit  commercial paper  corporate notes  foreign and united states government instruments and other readily marketable debt instruments in accordance with our investment policy 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale compared to million at december  sources of cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale during the year ended december  included million from operations and million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock option and purchase plans 
uses of cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale during the year ended december  included million used to purchase property and capital equipment and million used to pay notes payable 
under the terms of our agreement with mds canada  we are obligated to make periodic payments into an escrow account 
these funds secure certain obligations we have under the agreement regarding minimum annual purchases and mds canada s establishment of a new facility to supply us with yttrium in general  our required escrow deposits will decrease over time if we satisfy portions of our minimum annual purchase commitment 
as of march   we have paid million into this escrow fund 
in april  we purchased a  square foot facility to house our future clinical manufacturing area 
we anticipate that we will have to invest approximately million in to fund construction of building improvements for this new facility and expect to pay for these costs through our working capital 
in september  we purchased approximately acres in san diego for a proposed corporate headquarters and research and development campus 
additional costs we expect to incur in connection with this campus include design  development and construction costs  as well as the purchase and installation of equipment and furnishings for the campus 
we estimate these costs at approximately million over a two year period 
we expect to pay for these costs in part from our working capital and we presently are evaluating financing the remaining costs for this campus through any number of financing arrangements  including a sale of equity or debt securities  financings with banks or other financial institutions or an off balance sheet lease arrangement that will likely involve using cash on hand as collateral 
we cannot assure you that financing for this campus will be obtained on acceptable terms  if at all 
in the third quarter of  we began preliminary site engineering preparations for the campus  which could potentially expand to over  square feet of facilities 
the first phase of construction is expected to be completed in early in september  we purchased a acre site in oceanside for approximately million in cash 
we plan to build a large scale manufacturing facility at the location  which we anticipate using to commercialize our products currently in clinical trials if they are approved by the fda 
additional costs we expect to incur in connection with this facility include design  development  construction  validation and start up costs  as well as the purchase and installation of equipment and furnishings for the facility 
we estimate these costs at over million over a four year period 
we expect to pay for these costs in part from our working capital and we are presently evaluating financing alternatives including a sale of equity or debt securities  financings with banks or other financial institutions or an off balance sheet lease arrangement that will likely involve using cash on hand as collateral 
we cannot assure you that financing for this facility will be obtainable on acceptable terms  if at all 
in the first quarter of  we began preliminary site engineering preparations for the first phase of development  which is anticipated to be approximately  square feet of facility space for manufacturing  warehousing  utilities  maintenance  laboratories and offices 
we expect the first phase of the new facility to be mechanically completed in  followed by commissioning and validation in and this expansion will allow us to better control the manufacture of our products  reducing our reliance on contract manufacturers  as well as to reduce commercial risk 
in february  we raised through the sale of convertible promissory notes approximately million  net of underwriting commissions and expenses of million 
the convertible promissory notes are zero coupon and were priced with a yield to maturity of annually 
upon maturity  the convertible promissory notes will have an aggregate principal face value of million 
each  aggregate principal face value convertible promissory note is convertible at the holders option at any time through maturity into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of 
we are required under the terms of the convertible promissory notes  following a change in control occurring on or before february   to purchase any convertible promissory note at the option of its holder at a price equal to the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of purchase 
additionally  the holders of the convertible promissory notes may require us to purchase the convertible promissory notes on february   or at a price equal to the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of purchase with us having the option to repay the convertible promissory notes plus accrued original issue discount in cash  our common stock or a combination thereof 
we have the right to redeem the convertible promissory notes on or after february  in october  we entered into a collaborative research and license agreement with glaxosmithkline related to the development and commercialization of compounds based on our primatized anti cd antibodies 
in february  we amended and restated our agreement with glaxosmithkline which resulted in all anti cd program rights  including those for idec  being returned to us 
we will receive no further funding from glaxosmithkline under the restated agreement 
as part of the restated agreement  glaxosmithkline has the option to negotiate commercialization and copromotion rights with us for the first compound based on our primatized anti cd antibodies to complete a phase ii study 
if we do not commercialize and copromote the compound with glaxosmithkline  we will pay glaxosmithkline royalties on sales and licensees by us or our affiliates on products emerging from the rights returned to us under the restated agreement 
we had future minimum lease payment obligations under our operating leases of million as of december  additionally  in february  we entered into a lease agreement in which we will pay million over the next four years 
at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties other than what is disclosed in item financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements note new accounting standards in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  or statement no 
 which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and for the associated asset retirement costs 
the standard applies to tangible long lived assets that have a legal obligation associated with their retirement that results from the acquisition  construction or development or normal use of the assets 
we are required and plan to adopt the provisions of statement no 
effective january  it is not anticipated that the financial impact of this statement will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or statement no 
 which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  including discontinued operations 
while statement no 
supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that statement 
statement no 
also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  or opinion no 
 for the disposal of a segment of a business 
statement no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  it is not anticipated that the financial impact of this statement will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and the cost of our debt 
at december   we maintained a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
we also maintained an investment portfolio containing financial instruments in which the majority have original maturities of greater than three months but less than months 
these financial instruments  principally comprised of corporate obligations and to a lesser extent foreign and us government obligations  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
a hypothetical ten percent change in interest rates during the year ended december   would have resulted in approximately a million change in pretax income 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our long term debt totaled million at december  and was comprised solely of the convertible promissory notes which bears interest at a rate of 
due to the fixed rate nature of the convertible promissory notes  an immediate ten percent change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
underlying market risk exists related to an increase in our stock price or an increase in interest rates may make conversion of the convertible promissory notes to common stock beneficial to the convertible promissory notes holder 
conversion of the convertible promissory notes would have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share and book value per common share
