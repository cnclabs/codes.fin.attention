item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition at the end of fiscal  the company had working capital of million and a current ratio of to compared with million and to at the end of fiscal the fiscal balance sheet reflects the writedown of assets of the discontinued manufacturing and marketing segment to their estimated net realizable value 
fiscal balances have been reclassified to segregate the net assets of the discontinued business  including million of current assets and million of noncurrent assets 
receivables decreased million in the year  and receivable days outstanding improved from to current liabilities reflect the reclassification of notes payable to insurance companies and bank debt from long term to current maturities  discussed further below 
accounts payable decreased million due mainly to a decrease in inventory levels in fiscal compared with the prior year 
other accrued liabilities rose million  primarily related to additional liabilities for severance  lease termination and closing costs associated with the sale of manufacturing and marketing  additional self insurance reserves and restructuring costs at life retail 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow provided by operations in fiscal was million versus million in the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to the reduction in inventories in the discontinued manufacturing and marketing segment 
cash flow provided by operating activities in the continuing operations decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due mainly to increases in accounts payable and other accruals relating to the loss on sale of the manufacturing and marketing segment and the restructuring and other charges in the life retail segment 
net cash used in investing activities was million  an increase of million over the prior year 
included in that increase was an increase in capital expenditures of million this year over last year  primarily to support productivity improvements and energy efficiency in the textile services segment and for investments in new life retail stores and supporting information systems 
an additional million of the change is attributable to cash flow provided in fiscal from plant closings in the textile services and manufacturing and marketing segments  and the sale of an office facility in that year 
the million increase in cash flow used in financing activities in fiscal reflects the repayment of million of insurance company debt  offset by the million proceeds from issuance of bank debt and by a reduction in dividend payments 
the loan agreements with insurance companies and bank require the company to comply with certain financial covenants 
the most restrictive of these covenants requires that the company maintain a minimum of million in consolidated net worth  as defined 
due to the writedown of assets and related loss on disposal of the manufacturing and marketing segment  the company is not in compliance with that net worth covenant 
as a result  all of the notes to insurance companies and bank have been reclassified to current liabilities 
the company expects to obtain covenant waivers during the day cure period from the existing lenders pending the sale of the manufacturing and marketing segment 
the company also expects to use approximately million of the proceeds from the sale to pay down a significant portion of the debt 
management of the company and its outside financial advisors are engaged in discussions with current and prospective lenders regarding refinancing alternatives for the remaining debt 
although the company expects to pay down the debt and refinance the remainder as described  there is some risk that the sale of the manufacturing and marketing segment will not be consummated as expected 
therefore  the company and its advisors are simultaneously pursuing negotiations for a bank line of credit of sufficient size to allow the company to pay off all of its existing debt should that become necessary 
it is management s opinion that the company s financial condition is such that internal and external resources are sufficient and available to satisfy the company s requirements for debt repayment  as well as future requirements for capital expenditures  dividends and working capital 
analysis of fiscal continuing operations compared to combined sales and revenues in fiscal were million  an increase of million or percent from the prior year 
textile services segment revenues increased percent  from million to million 
for the second consecutive year  this segment generated a record amount of net new business additions new business additions less lost business 
sales at life retail stores declined percent  from million to million 
same store sales in fiscal decreased by percent  the result of a weak retail market during the last three quarters of the year 
the largest sales decline occurred in the segment s hospitality business  which the company has decided to exit as part of its restructuring plan 
sales in the catalogue and e commerce distribution channels increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  but the increase was more than offset by the decline in sales from the retail stores 
the gross profit percent to combined sales and revenues in fiscal was percent  up slightly from percent in the prior year 
an increase in gross margins in the textile services segment more than offset a decrease in gross margins at life retail stores 
gross margins in the textile services segment were positively affected by better pricing  continuing improvements in plant productivity and linen cost management and effective management of energy costs 
as a result  earnings in this segment rose percent from the prior year 
in the life retail stores segment  gross margins and earnings were negatively affected by the restructuring and other charges discussed below 
excluding the restructuring charges  gross margins at life retail were up slightly in fiscal  and earnings for the segment declined from million in fiscal to a loss of 
million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or percent in fiscal compared with fiscal this also represented an increase as a percentage of combined sales and revenues to percent from percent in the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to increased selling expenses and incentive compensation payments in the textile services segment and a full year of expenses relating to catalogue operations at life retail in fiscal interest expense decreased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal due to prepayment during the year of million of debt that was originally due to be paid in december  the company s overall effective tax rate for fiscal was percent compared with percent in the prior year 
the effective rate for continuing operations in fiscal was percent due to the high amount of permanent differences in relation to the low level of income in that year 
this compares with a rate of percent for continuing operations in fiscal analysis of fiscal continuing operations compared to in fiscal  combined sales and revenues of million were flat compared to the prior year 
in the textile services segment  revenues decreased percent for the year but increased in both the third and fourth quarters  as this segment essentially completed its recovery from the loss of business in fiscal to an aggressive competitor in the marketplace 
a record amount of net new business additions was generated in this segment 
life retail stores sales improved million or percent  the result of a percent same store sales increase partially offset by having fewer stores in operation at the end of the year compared to the prior year 
the gross profit percent to combined sales and revenues in fiscal was percent  up from percent in the prior year 
gross margins in the textile services segment were up due to better management of linen costs and productivity improvements from installation of labor saving equipment 
although earnings of this segment increased percent from the prior year  they were negatively affected by sizable increases in energy costs in the second half of the year 
in the life retail stores segment  gross margins were essentially unchanged from the prior year as the selective discounting and markup cancellations initiated in fiscal were completed 
earnings of this segment declined percent as the sales increase was insufficient to overcome increases in wages and other costs  including the initial costs of entering the catalogue and e commerce distribution channels in the third quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or percent in fiscal as a percentage of combined sales and revenues  these expenses increased to percent from percent in the prior year  reflective of the investments made to revitalize sales efforts in the textile services segment and the relocation of the textile services administrative offices 
consolidated earnings in fiscal benefited from lower interest expense as a result of lower debt balances and from increased interest income due to higher cash balances 
the total effective tax rate of percent in fiscal was unchanged from the prior year 
discontinued operations results from discontinued operations represent the activity of the manufacturing and marketing segment  including the estimated loss on sale and discontinuation of the segment 
this business was adversely affected in fiscal by weakness in the economy during the year and by the aftermath of the september terrorist attacks on sales to certain market segments  such as lodging  food service  gaming and recreation 
in fiscal  sales suffered from lower than expected demand for certain products and delays in large customer program rollouts 
however  gross margins and earnings for the segment in fiscal improved over the prior year as efforts to lower costs through increased non domestic contract sourcing continued to prove successful 
on january   the company s board of directors approved a plan to discontinue the manufacturing and marketing segment 
assets of the segment have been written down and a loss on disposal of the segment has been recorded based on the estimated net realizable value from the pending sale  as well as estimates of the cost of disposal and transition 
negotiations continue with two prospective buyers  one of which would purchase certain assets of the non healthcare business of the segment and the other of which would purchase certain assets of the healthcare business 
management believes its estimates used to record the loss on disposal and related asset writedown are reasonable 
however  there is risk that the value received upon ultimate disposition of the segment  including actual costs of disposal and transition  may differ significantly from amounts recorded in the financial statements for fiscal restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company developed plans to close underperforming stores and exit the hospitality line of business in the life retail stores segment 
the underperforming stores produced a collective operating loss of 
million in fiscal the company recorded restructuring and other charges in fiscal of million relating to these activities 
of that amount  million is included in cost of goods sold and primarily represents a writedown of the remaining inventory in the hospitality line and in stores to be closed 
the remaining million is included in restructuring charge and represents the estimated cost for lease terminations and a writedown of fixed assets and other assets related to the closed stores 
certain estimates were used in the development of costs included in the restructuring and other charges 
actual results may differ from these estimates  which could result in additional costs 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of the accounting policies as discussed below require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating amounts to record in the financial statements 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
self insurance liabilities the company self insures liabilities for non union employee medical coverage and liabilities for casualty insurance claims  including workers compensation  general liability and vehicle liability  up to certain levels 
the company purchases insurance coverage for large claims over the self insured retention levels 
in fiscal  the company negotiated a buyout of all casualty claims occurring prior to february  the liability for casualty claims as of january  includes losses for claims since the buyout date 
self insurance liabilities are developed using actuarial methods and historical data for payment patterns  cost trends and other relevant factors 
while management believes that the recorded liabilities for casualty and employee medical claims as of january  are adequate  and that appropriate judgment has been applied in determining the estimates  such estimated liabilities could differ materially from actual liabilities resulting from the ultimate disposition of the claims 
deferred income taxes the company recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities 
balances in the deferred income tax accounts are regularly reviewed for adequacy and recoverability by analyzing the expected income necessary to realize the deferred assets  the anticipated tax rates applicable when the deferred items are expected to be recognized and the ability to utilize carryforward items 
it is management s opinion that adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods presented  that all deferred tax assets will be fully recovered and that no valuation allowance is required
