item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview revenue in was impacted by economic weakness in the us and global economies 
spending patterns for information technology services in each quarter of were sequentially worse than the previous quarter 
as a result  demand for information technology services was lower than initial estimates 
the results of our operations are affected by general economic conditions as well as the level of economic activity and change in the industries we serve 
our business is also driven by the pace of technological change and the type and level of spending by our clients in the areas in which we provide services 
many factors can result in a deferral  reduction or cancellation of services requested by our prospective or current clients including budget constraints  economic conditions and perceived project progress  success or value 
in addition  during economic downturns  there can be pricing pressures encountered as companies try to minimize costs and negotiate lower prices for these services 
our ability to successfully identify and prepare for these changes early in their cycles is a key driver of our performance 
therefore  our strategy is to anticipate these trends and identify cost management initiatives that will allow us to manage costs relative to expected revenues 
project personnel costs constitute the majority of our operating costs 
because project personnel costs are driven primarily by the cost of billable personnel  mainly compensation and benefits  maintaining these costs at a reasonable and predictable percentage of revenue is critical to our financial performance 
project personnel costs as a percentage of revenues are driven by utilization and average billing rates 
utilization represents the percentage of our billable professionals time spent on billable work 
it is our strategy to match our project personnel supply with demand 
at times this requires us to reduce headcount and reassign employees to other active projects when they are no longer needed on a particular project 
however  because of the mix of skills needed and project duration  implementing this strategy may be delayed at times 
in furtherance of this strategy  we made significant staff reductions over the course of to address the decreased demand for the types of services that we offer  and the corresponding reduction in our revenues 
however  any unexpected decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in staffing  or a staffing increase that is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in revenues  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition estimating the allowance for doubtful receivables accounting for income taxes these policies are discussed further in this section under revenues  bad debt and income taxes 
presentation on february   we distributed the common stock of eloyalty corporation eloyalty owned by the company to the company s stockholders the spin off 
accordingly  the consolidated statements of operations for are discussed and analyzed with eloyalty s operations presented on a discontinued operations basis 
for the year ended december   there were no discontinued operations reported in our results of operations  as we had provided for the net loss on distribution in our results of operations for segments prior to june  we were organized into two business segments  digital enterprise consulting and peer effective june   we terminated the investment in and closed our peer software development operation within the peer segment and now we report entirely within one business segment 
revenues we derive our revenues from a variety of information technology services  including systems integration  packaged software integration and implementation services  programming  strategic business and management consulting and extended support services 
for most of our engagements  we recognize revenues on contracts on a time and materials basis as work is performed primarily based on hourly billing rates 
for our limited number of fixed price contracts  we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method  which is based on the percentage of work performed in the period compared to the total estimated work to be performed over the entire contract 
revenues are subject to revision as the contract progresses to completion 
any revisions in the estimate are charged to operations in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
contracts are performed in phases 
losses on contracts  if any  are reserved in full when determined 
contract losses are determined by the amount by which the estimated cost of the contract exceeds the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract 
extended support revenues are recognized as services are rendered 
out of pocket expenses are presented net of amounts billed to clients in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
costs and expenses project personnel project personnel costs consist primarily of professional salaries and benefits 
other project expenses other project expenses consist of nonbillable expenses incurred for client projects and business development 
these expenses include recruiting fees  selling expenses  personnel training and software development costs 
bad debt expense we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  on a client by client basis  when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful receivables and records any necessary bad debt expense based on the best estimate of the facts known to date 
should the facts regarding the collectability of receivables change  the resulting change in the allowance would be charged or credited to income in the period such determination is made and could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
management and administrative support management and administrative support costs consist of practice area costs and infrastructure costs 
practice area costs include support personnel and practice area selling  marketing and recruiting costs 
infrastructure costs include senior corporate management  accounting  financial reporting  finance  tax  legal  treasury  human resources  employee benefits  marketing  public and investor relations  office operations  recruiting  training  internal communications  internal technology applications  planning  quality assurance  and risk management 
goodwill amortization goodwill the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets of businesses acquired is amortized on a straight line basis  typically over a five year period 
the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment has occurred to assess recoverability based on undiscounted cash flows 
incentive compensation incentive compensation is accrued at a set percentage of base salary  which varies by level of employee  and adjusted to reflect the amounts needed for active employees and for performance against targets  goals and objectives 
payments of incentive compensation are performance based and are determined by both objective financial based and subjective measures 
income taxes we use an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities 
we do not provide us deferred income taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are expected to be indefinitely reinvested 
judgement is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have not provided a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets as we believe it is more likely than not that they will be fully utilized 
while we have considered future taxable income in determining whether these deferred tax assets will be fully utilized  should actual results differ from these estimates  or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance 
this resulting valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination is made and could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
calendar compared with calendar revenues consolidated net revenues were million for  a decrease of percent from we believe that this decline in revenue was primarily due to negative economic conditions throughout however other factors played a role in the decline  including a decline in corporate information technology capital expenditures as large and small companies reassessed their goals and budgets 
costs and expenses project personnel costs were million in  a decrease of percent from this decrease was largely attributable to staff reductions driven by our ongoing efforts to keep headcount in line with associated demand for our services  as described earlier in this item 
notwithstanding this reduction  project personnel costs as a percentage of net revenues were percent for versus percent for  mainly due to a lower utilization during the first half of the staff reductions taken during improved utilization during the second half of other project expenses were million for  a decrease of percent from this decrease was mainly due to improved company wide cost controls  reduced travel costs associated with lower average headcount  decreased international expenditures  and reduced software development costs as a result of the closure of our peer software development operation 
other project expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to percent for from percent for as a result of the items mentioned above 
bad debt expense was million for compared to million for this increase was largely attributable to financial problems at several clients 
management and administrative support costs were million for  a decrease of percent 
this decrease consisted of a decrease in practice area management and administrative costs of million  offset by an increase in infrastructure costs of million 
the decrease in practice area management and administrative costs of million included decreases in selling and marketing expenses and recruiting costs 
in tsc and eloyalty entered into a shared services agreement between tsc and eloyalty pursuant to which tsc provided to eloyalty certain administrative services 
we charged these services to eloyalty and  as a result  net infrastructure costs were reduced by million during there was no such offset during however  the infrastructure cost base was reduced by million in  excluding amounts billed to eloyalty 
this decrease included a reduction in domestic office costs  corporate marketing expenses and internal systems and human resources areas 
goodwill amortization of million was recorded in compared to million for these amounts were in addition to the million goodwill impairment charge that was recorded during for the closure of our peer software development operations as discussed further in this section 
as a result of this impairment charge  we have no goodwill on the balance sheet as of december during  we recorded million in restructuring and other charges comprised of million relating to the closure of our peer software development operation and million in non peer severance related costs 
the peer charge included million in goodwill impairment  million in asset write offs  million in costs associated with lease terminations  million in severance costs  million in professional fees and million in computer lease terminations  commitments and other costs 
as of december   we had used million of this charge for the following asset write offs of million  goodwill impairment of million  and cash payments of million related to peer severance costs of approximately employees  million in professional fees  million in lease costs and million in other costs 
the remaining accrual balance relates to lease terminations and is expected to be utilized by february the non peer severance charge of million included million in severance costs  million in asset write offs and million in other costs 
as of december   we had used million of this charge for cash payments of million related to the severance of approximately employees  other cash payments of million and million in asset write offs 
we expect that the remaining accrual balance will be utilized by the second quarter of during  we also reversed restructuring and other charges of million related to certain lease terminations recorded in during  we recorded restructuring and other charges of million for the closure of our latin american operations 
subsequent to the recording of the charge we collected million of accounts receivables previously written off and  as a result  the cumulative charge was reduced to million in as of december   we had used million of this charge for the following cash payments of million related to the severance costs for approximately employees  lease terminations and professional fees million paid in  million in asset write offs  and the offset of the accounts receivable collections of million 
the remaining accrual balance represents professional fees and various other closure costs and is expected to be utilized by the second quarter of during  we also reversed restructuring and other charges of million related to certain lease terminations and severance charges recorded in incentive compensation of million was accrued for compared to million for incentive compensation as a percentage of net revenues remained unchanged at percent for both and we expect to continue to accrue incentive compensation in operating loss consolidated operating loss was million for compared to a loss of million for our operating losses for and included certain restructuring and other charges and credits as described above 
excluding these charges and credits  our operating loss for was million compared to a loss of million for this increase in operating loss was mainly due to an increase in the bad debt expense and the decline in revenues  offset by a decrease in other project expenses 
other income and expense other income and expense for was million compared to million for this decrease is a result of lower interest rates and average cash and cash equivalent balances throughout as compared to income tax benefit the effective tax rate for was a tax benefit of percent compared to a tax benefit of percent for the tax benefit for was less than the federal statutory rate mainly due to nondeductible goodwill  partially offset by state tax benefits on the loss for the year 
shares outstanding weighted average number of common shares outstanding and weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding decreased slightly due to significant purchases of our stock under our previously announced stock repurchase program  offset by the exercise of stock options and the issuance of shares under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
calendar compared with calendar revenues consolidated net revenues were million for  a decrease of percent from this decrease was mainly due to a decline in the demand for erp solutions  as well as a decline in the demand for certain of our other services as a result of client budgetary constraints relating to year issues 
costs and expenses project personnel costs were million for  a decrease of percent from this decrease was mainly due to a decrease in average professional headcount as we streamlined and refocused our business to respond to the reduced demand for our services 
due to this streamlining  project personnel costs as a percentage of net revenues remained relatively constant at percent for versus percent in the prior year  even as revenue declined year over year 
other project expenses were million for  a decrease of percent from this decrease was largely comprised of reductions in our domestic hiring  training  communication and computer expenses related to a decrease in our average headcount and reductions in our international costs related to the closure of our latin american operations and the restructuring of our european operations as discussed further in this section 
these decreases were partially offset by costs associated with increased selling and business development efforts 
notwithstanding this overall decline  other project expenses as a percentage of net revenues rose to percent for from percent for due to a year over year decline in revenues and increased selling and business development efforts 
bad debt expense was million for compared to million for this increase was primarily due to cash flow problems at certain of our dot com clients 
management and administrative support costs were million for  a decrease of percent from the decrease was due to a decrease of million in infrastructure costs  offset by an increase in practice area management and administrative costs of million 
the decrease in infrastructure costs were mainly due to reductions in costs associated with  internal systems  human resources  corporate recruiting  domestic offices  legal  marketing  finance  accounting  investor relations and international operations 
the increase in practice area management and administrative costs included increased practice area support personnel costs and various other costs due to increased selling efforts 
of the decrease in infrastructure costs discussed above  million reflects a credit associated with the services we provided to eloyalty in connection with the spin off and pursuant to the shared services agreement as more fully discussed earlier in this item 
goodwill amortization was million for versus million for this increase was attributable to our acquisition of coursenet systems  inc coursenet in the fourth quarter of during  we recorded restructuring and other charges of million for the closure of our latin american operations  as more fully described earlier in this item 
during  we also reversed restructuring and other charges of million related to certain lease terminations and severance charges recorded in during  we recorded million in restructuring and other charges associated with lease terminations of million  former executive severance costs of million  coursenet acquisition costs of million  asset write offs of million and changes to business operations and related severance costs of million 
incentive compensation of million was accrued for compared to million for incentive compensation as a percentage of net revenues was percent for versus percent for this increase resulted from our decision to retain certain staff with the necessary expertise that we believed was needed in operating loss consolidated operating loss from continuing operations was million for compared to a loss of million for our operating loss for included certain restructuring and other charges and credits  as described above  as well as million in administrative costs with respect to the period prior to the spin off that would have been allocated to eloyalty 
our operating loss for included certain restructuring and other charges as described above as well as million in administrative costs with respect to the period prior to the spin off that would have been allocated to eloyalty 
excluding these charges and credits  operating loss for was million compared to operating income of million for this was mainly due to the reduction in revenues offset by a reduction in overall costs 
other income and expense other income and expense was million for compared to million for the decrease is a result of lower cash and cash equivalent balances during compared to the decrease in cash and cash equivalent balances mainly resulted from the spin off of eloyalty and the costs associated therewith 
income tax benefit our effective tax rate for was a tax benefit of percent compared to a tax benefit of percent for this increase resulted from foreign tax rate differences having minimal impact on the tax rate and non taxable investments having a larger impact on the tax rate during compared to shares outstanding weighted average number of common shares outstanding and weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding increased from to this increase was due to the exercise of stock options  the issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and the purchase of our common stock by two venture capital firms in august see note in notes to consolidated financial statements  partially offset by our repurchase of some of some outstanding shares 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in and net cash used in operating activities was million in for  the net loss  before bad debt expense  restructuring and other charges  depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes contributed million to cash provided by operations 
in addition  tax refunds of million  a decrease in receivables of million and other working capital improvements of million contributed an additional million 
partially offsetting these amounts were payments made for restructuring and other charges of million 
cash commitments relating to remaining restructuring and other charges are million in severance related costs and million of other commitments 
these amounts are expected to be paid through estimated future cash commitments also include various office facilities  property and office equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates 
the minimum cash commitments net of the amount included in restructuring charges under these non cancelable operating leases with terms in excess of one year are as follows million in  million in  million in  million in and million in in addition  we have minimum annual commitments for telecommunications of million in and million in the company has no guarantees of third party debt as of december   nor any other off balance sheet commitments 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for we received million from the sale of available for sale securities 
the proceeds from available for sale securities were transferred to cash and cash equivalents 
capital expenditures for were million 
we currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities was million for during the year  we purchased  treasury shares under our share repurchase program for million and received million from the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million in and million in as a result of the eloyalty spin off and costs associated with the spin off 
since the spin off we increased our cash from million in to million in our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and anticipated operating cash flows 
we believe that these sources are sufficient to meet our current cash requirements 
however  operating results and liquidity  including our ability to raise additional capital if necessary  may be adversely affected by a decrease in demand for the company s services 
while it is our strategy to reduce costs in order to match our capacity with demand  this may not achieve any necessary cost savings 
in addition  a number of other factors  including change in general economic conditions  technological changes  competition  and the suspension or cancellation of a large project could have an adverse effect on future results and liquidity 
these aforementioned factors  as well as other factors  are discussed further in this section under assumptions underlying certain forward looking statements and factors that may affect future results 
we have a million unsecured line of credit facility the facility with bank of america national trust and savings association bank of america 
the agreement expires december  at our election  loans made under the facility bear interest at either the bank of america reference rate or the applicable eurodollar interest rate plus percent 
the unused line fee is percent of the unused portion of the commitment 
the facility requires  among other things  that we maintain certain financial ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with these financial ratio requirements 
there was no borrowing under the line of credit during impact of inflation and backlog inflation should not have a significant impact on our income to the extent we are able to raise our billing rates to commensurate with our staff compensation rates  which we have done successfully in the past 
because the majority of our contracts may be terminated on relatively short notice  we do not consider backlog to be meaningful 
if we are unable to raise our billing rates  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
new accounting standards on july   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
is effective for any business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for under a single method  the purchase method of accounting 
use of the pooling of interests method is no longer permitted 
sfas no 
was effective for tsc january  under sfas no 
 goodwill should no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis 
we anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
will not have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position 
on august   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas no 
is required for adoption for fiscal years beginning after june  we anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position 
on october   the fasb issued sfas no  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the objectives of sfas no 
are to address the significant issues relating to the implementation of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and to develop a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas no 
 for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
we anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
the eitf concluded that reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred should be characterized as revenue in the income statement 
this consensus is to be applied in financial reporting periods beginning after december  historically  we presented reimbursed out of pocket net of amounts billed to clients 
accordingly  beginning in calendar year  we will include reimbursed out of pocket expenses as a separate component of revenues and expenses in our statements of operations 
this change in presentation will not affect reported net income or loss 
assumptions underlying certain forward looking statements and factors that may affect future results this form k contains or may contain certain forward looking statements concerning our financial position  business strategy  budgets  projected costs and plans and objectives of management for future operations as well as other statements including words such as anticipate  believe  plan  estimate  expect  intend  and other similar expressions 
these forward looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  readers are cautioned that no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove correct and that actual results and developments may differ materially from those conveyed in such forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements in this form k include  among others  the pace of technological change  our ability to manage growth and attract and retain employees  our ability to accommodate a changing business environment  general business and economic conditions in our operating regions  market conditions and competitive and other factors  all as more fully described below 
such forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this form k 
if we do update or correct one or more forward looking statements  investors and others should not conclude that we will make additional updates or corrections with respect thereto or with respect to other forward looking statements 
the cautionary statements provided below are being made pursuant to the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the pslra and with the intention of obtaining the benefits of the safe harbor provisions of the pslra for any such forward looking information 
many of the factors discussed below  as well as other factors  have also been discussed in our prior filings 
factors which could cause our actual financial and other results to differ materially from any results that we might project  forecast  estimate or budget in the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the following rapid technological change the systems consulting and implementation market has experienced rapid technological advances and developments in recent years including the development and issuance of new software products and applications 
our failure to stay abreast of such advances and developments could materially adversely affect our business 
we utilize a number of different technologies in developing and providing it solutions for our customers 
the technologies we use are developing rapidly and are characterized by evolving industry standards in a wide variety of areas 
while we evaluate technologies on an ongoing basis and endeavor to utilize those that are most effective in developing it solutions for our customers  there can be no assurance that the technologies we utilize and the expertise we gain in those technologies will continue to be applicable in the future 
there can be no assurance that new technologies will be made available to us or that we can economically apply such technologies 
the inability to apply existing technologies and expertise to subsequent projects could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
management of change in demand from time to time  our business has experienced significant increases and decreases in the demand for our services and thus  our revenues 
our ability to successfully manage such fluctuations in demand is key to our future success 
an unexpected decline in demand without a corresponding and timely reduction in staffing and other expenses  or a staffing increase that is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in demand  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
additionally  any future increase in demand without a corresponding increase in staffing may render us unable to maintain or improve our market share and or strain or overwhelm existing management resources  operational resources  financial resources and management information systems and controls 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage future fluctuation in demand successfully 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will grow or achieve the rates of growth we have experienced during certain periods in the recent past 
we expect that we may need to further develop our financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures to accommodate future growth or changes in the structure of our business 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to develop such controls  systems or procedures effectively or on a timely basis  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
ability to attract and retain employees our business consists mainly of professional services and is inherently labor intensive 
our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees  particularly project managers and other senior personnel  for our domestic and international operations 
qualified project managers are in particularly great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource during certain periods in the future 
several attributes of our work environment pose challenges to our ability to attract and retain employees  including i extensive travel requirements  ii our intense work environment and culture  iii our standards for employee technical skills and job performance  and iv our practice of adjusting the number of technical personnel to reflect active project levels 
although we expect to continue to attract sufficient numbers of highly skilled employees and to retain its existing project managers and other senior personnel for the foreseeable future  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
growth by acquisition we may acquire existing businesses 
the success of any such acquisition will depend upon  among other things  the ability of our management and employees to integrate acquired personnel  operations  products and technologies into our organization effectively  to retain and motivate key personnel of acquired businesses and to retain customers of acquired firms 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities  consummate acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired personnel and operations 
in addition  any acquisitions we undertake may involve certain other risks  including potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns 
entry into new lines of business we may enter into new lines of businesses 
our success in any such endeavor will depend upon  among other things  the ability of our management to identify suitable opportunities  successfully implement sound business strategies and avoid the legal and business risks of any new line of business in which we may operate 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to do any of the foregoing 
in addition  any such undertaking may divert management s attention from the operation and growth of our core business 
dependence on key personnel the loss of some or all of our management personnel or project managers could have a material adverse impact on the company  including its ability to secure and complete engagements 
we have employment agreements with our senior management employees that contain non competition  non disclosure and non solicitation covenants 
our employment agreements with our senior management employees generally do not have fixed expiration dates and may be terminated by either the company or the employee 
our employment agreements with lower tier vice presidents generally have a fixed initial term but are automatically renewed for successive one year periods unless terminated by either the company or the employee 
other senior employees also have employment agreements that are generally terminable by the company or the employee upon to days written notice 
cyclicality certain of our customers and potential customers are in industries that experience cyclical variations in profitability  which may in turn affect their willingness or ability to fund systems projects such as those for which we may be engaged 
our experience indicates  however  that competitive pressures in cyclical industries sometimes compel businesses to undertake systems projects even during periods of losses or reduced profitability 
litigation from time to time  we have been subject to litigation 
where we can make a reasonable estimate of the probable liability relating to pending litigation  we record a related liability 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability and revise estimates as appropriate 
however  because of uncertainties relating to litigation  the amount of our estimates could be wrong 
in addition to the potential cost and use of cash  pending or future litigation could divert management s attention and resources causing a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
quarterly results may fluctuate our results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of various factors such as differences in the number of billing days and or holidays between quarters  the number of vacation days and sick days taken by our employees in a particular quarter  and varying weather conditions 
these and other factors can reduce revenues in a given quarter with a corresponding adverse impact on our margins 
project risks because of the project based nature of our work and the fact that many of the projects we undertake are large  there is a risk of a material adverse impact on operating results because of the unanticipated suspension or cancellation of a large project or a client s refusal or failure to pay fees and expenses when due 
a project cancellation or suspension or a refusal or failure to pay can be based on any number of causes  many of which are beyond our control 
these include  but are not limited to  financial difficulties of a client  personality disputes between client and project personnel  a change in client priorities and a change in client ownership 
the suspension or cancellation of a project or a failure or refusal to pay fees and expenses when due could result in a decrease or adjustment in revenues  the need to reassign staff and damage to our reputation 
because many of our projects are high profile  mission critical projects for major clients  a failure or inability to meet a client s expectations for the amounts budgeted  timing and deliverables for the projects we undertake could damage our reputation and affect our ability to attract new business 
third party products and services are integral to the success of many of our projects 
to the extent that third parties do not deliver effective products and services on a timely basis  our project results could be negatively impacted 
although we attempt to limit this risk in its engagement arrangements with clients and maintain errors and omissions insurance  the failure of a project could expose us to significant incremental financial exposure 
competition the systems consulting and implementation market comprises a large number of participants  is subject to rapid changes and is highly competitive 
we compete with and face potential competition from a number of companies that have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than do we 
we also compete with smaller service providers whose specific  more narrowly focused service offerings may be more attractive to potential clients than our multi dimensional approach 
our clients primarily consist of fortune and other large corporations and there are an increasing number of professional services firms seeking systems consulting and implementation engagements from that client base 
we believe that our ability to compete depends in part on a number of factors outside our control  including the ability of our competitors to hire  retain and motivate a significant number of senior project managers  the ownership by our competitors of software used by potential clients  the development by others of software that is competitive with our products and services  and the price at which others offer comparable services 
in addition  our clients could develop or acquire in house expertise in services similar to those we provide  which would significantly reduce demand for our services 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain our existing client base  maintain or increase the level of revenue generated by our existing clients or be able to attract new clients 
susceptibility to general economic conditions our revenues and results of operations are subject to fluctuations based on the general economic conditions of the united states as well as the foreign countries in which we operate 
the united states is currently experiencing a general economic downturn or recession 
during these periods of general economic downturn or recession  businesses typically reduce or eliminate their spending on discretionary items such as the services that we provide 
therefore  in the event that this economic downturn continues or is not reversed  there can be no assurance that our business  operating results and financial condition will not be materially adversely affected 
cost overruns although our engagements are generally billed on a time and materials basis  some of our projects are contracted on a not to exceed or fixed price basis 
our failure to complete these projects within the not to exceed or fixed price requirement exposes us to unrecoverable cost overruns  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
intellectual property rights many of our clients have required that we grant to them all proprietary and intellectual property rights with respect to the work product resulting from our performance of services  including the intellectual property rights to any custom software that we have developed for them 
each grant of proprietary and intellectual property rights limits our ability to reuse work product components and work product solutions with other clients 
in a limited number of such situations  we have obtained  and in the future may attempt to obtain  ownership interest or a license from our clients to permit us to market custom software for the joint benefit of the client and the company 
these arrangements may be nonexclusive or exclusive  and licensors to the company may retain the right to sell products and services that compete with ours 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to negotiate future software licenses upon terms acceptable to us 
we also develop certain foundation and application software tools  methodologies and products that we own and licensed to our clients 
we regard these software tools  methodologies and products as proprietary and intend to protect our rights  where appropriate  with registered copyrights  patents  registered trademarks  trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure and transferring title 
however  there can be no assurance that any of these steps will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary rights or independent third party development of functionally equivalent products 
tsc and technology solutions company are registered service marks of the company 
in addition  our success is dependent upon our specialized expertise and methodologies 
to protect our proprietary information  we rely on a combination of trade secret and common law employee non disclosure policies and third party confidentiality agreements 
however  there can be no assurance that any of these steps will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our specialized expertise and methodologies 
although we believe that our services and products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  there can be no assurance that others will not assert infringement claims against us in the future 
risks of conducting international operations we engage in international operations 
because the cost of doing business abroad is typically higher for united states businesses than the cost of doing business domestically  we could experience a decline in our operating margins if the significance of our international operations increases 
international operations and the provision of services in foreign markets are subject to a number of special risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade barriers  exchange controls  national and regional labor strikes  political risks  additional security concerns and risks of increases in duties  taxes and governmental royalties  as well as changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies 
in addition  any success we experience internationally may depend upon our ability to attract  develop and retain a sufficient number of highly skilled  motivated local professional employees in each of those foreign countries where we conduct operations 
competition for such local personnel qualified to deliver our services is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to recruit  develop and retain a sufficient number of highly skilled  motivated local professional employees to compete successfully in the international market
