critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect its reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  warranty obligations  intangible assets  income taxes  revenue recognition and contingencies and litigation 
the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to the company and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title has transferred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company accrues for estimated sales returns and other allowances at the time of recognition of revenue  which is typically upon shipment  based on historical experience 
if different assumptions were employed in making these estimates  the amount of reported revenue could be affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments  which results in bad debt expense 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances in which it is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation  it records a specific reserve of the bad debt against amounts due 
in addition  the company must make judgments and estimates of the collectibility of accounts receivables based on historical bad debt  customers credit worthiness  current economic trends  recent changes in customer payment trends  and deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position 
if circumstances change adversely  additional allowances may be required 
inventory inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and with cost determined by the first in  first out method

table of contents the company may be required write down inventory it is carrying at higher value due to changes in competitive conditions  new product introductions by the company or its competitors  or rapid changes in customer demand 
goodwill the company uses assumptions in establishing the carrying value of its goodwill 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in goodwill include significant changes in the asset s ability to generate positive cash flow  a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends and significant changes in the company s strategic business objectives 
warranty the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized 
the amount of this provision is determined by using actual historical expenses and potential risks associated with the company s different products 
should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty provision would be required

in addition  any statements that refer to expectations  projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward looking statements 
the company is not obligated to update or revise these forward looking statements to 
table of contents reflect new events or circumstances 
factors that could cause actual results  events or circumstances to differ from forward looking statements made in this report include those set forth in the following risk factors section 
risk factors the company is dependent on a concentrated line of products the company s future financial performance will be dependent on its patient monitor product line  which includes a limited number of products 
in the mri monitoring market  the growth of the market for its mri monitors is heavily dependent on the continued acceptance of mri technology as a diagnostic tool 
in the general patient monitoring market  future growth of the company s millennia and m monitors is dependent on its ability to further penetrate an already competitive market 
in addition  the recent consolidation in the medical care provider market has resulted in a number of very large purchasers of medical devices 
these large purchasers typically prefer to establish relationships with medical device manufacturers that have broad and diverse product lines 
the failure of the company s products to continue to gain market acceptance or a continued consolidation of the medical care provider market could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
the company faces substantial levels of competition the company has encountered and will continue to encounter significant competition in the sale of its products 
the company s general patient monitoring competitors include a number of large multinational corporations 
some of these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than the company can 
in the mri patient monitoring market  the company has enjoyed a significant first to market advantage over its competitors 
however  competitors have introduced products designed to compete with its mri vital signs monitoring products 
in addition  as the market for mri vital signs monitoring products expands it may attract competitors with greater resources 
additionally  competition may increase if new companies enter the company s markets or if existing competitors expand their product lines or intensify efforts within existing product lines 
the introduction of competitive products may result in a decrease in the company s market share and in a decrease in the prices at which the company is able to sell its products 
the company s market share could also be adversely affected by increasing concentration in the medical care provider market 
any decrease in the company s market share or decrease in the prices at which the company is able to sell its products could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
the company s financial results may fluctuate the company s financial results may fluctuate significantly from period to period because of a variety of factors  many of which is beyond its control 
these factors include increased competition  including possible future competition in the mri monitor market changes in the company s pricing policies and those of its competitors changes in the company s operating expenses or capital expenditures timing and market acceptance of new and upgraded product introductions by the company and its competitors introduction of alternative technologies by the company and its competitors effect of potential acquisitions other general economic factors 
table of contents fluctuations caused by these and other factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company is subject to a significant risk of new laws related to health care changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have a significant effect on the company s costs of doing business and the amount of reimbursement the company receives from both government and third party payors 
in addition  economic forces  regulatory influences and political initiatives are subjecting the health care industry to fundamental changes 
federal  state and local government representatives are likely to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems and payment methods 
the company expects ongoing public debate on these issues 
any of these efforts or reforms could have a material adverse affect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s business is subject to technological change and introduction of new products technological change  evolving industry standards and new product introductions and enhancements characterize the markets for the company s products 
many of the company s products and products under development are technologically innovative  and therefore require significant planning  design  development and testing 
these activities require the company to make significant capital commitments and investments 
in addition  industry standards may change on short notice and new products and technologies may render existing products and technologies uncompetitive 
additionally  the products that the company is currently developing  and those that the company develops in the future  may not be technologically feasible or accepted by the marketplace or they may not be completed in an acceptable time frame 
technological change could prevent the company from achieving the benefits it expects form research initiatives and could also result in a loss from existing products 
the company currently is involved in a legal proceeding the company s medical device subsidiary  invivo research  was one of two third party defendants named in a lawsuit in june of by southern nevada surgical center and surgex southern nevada  inc in nevada state district court 
the underlying action in this matter stemmed from an incident involving a surgical patient undergoing a procedure at the southern nevada surgical center 
the patient suffered a serious permanent brain injury 
a lawsuit was filed on behalf of the patient against the surgical center and the anesthesiologist who monitored the patient 
the defendants in that action made a substantial settlement to the patient 
southern nevada surgical center snsc and surgex were seeking indemnity and contribution of approximately million from the manufacturer of the anesthetic gas machine and invivo research  which manufactured the vital signs monitor used in this procedure 
snsc and surgex alleged that both the anesthetic gas machine and the vital signs monitor were defective 
the company believes that the vital signs monitor operated properly and was properly designed for its intended function 
on august   the nevada district court granted the company s motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute 
the order granted dismissal of the snsc and surgex contribution claims  without prejudice  based upon nevada law that provides that an action must be brought to trial within five years of the date of the filing of the original action 
the dismissal is being appealed 
in april of  the plaintiff s insurer  cna  filed an action with identical causes in the same nevada state court 
this second action was removed by the company to us district court 
the action by cna was dismissed by the district court on january  as the district court found cna did not have standing as the real party of interest 
cna appealed the decision to the ninth circuit court of appeals 
a three member panel of the ninth circuit reversed the dismissal and remanded the case back to federal district court on july  the company appealed this decision and requested a decision from the full panel of the ninth circuit 
the ninth circuit  without issuing an opinion  unanimously voted to deny the petition for rehearing in this matter 
the action has been remanded to the us district court for further proceedings 
any judgment against the company that exceeds the amount that its insurer is required to pay could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
the company faces product liability and product recall risks 
table of contents with respect to all of its products  and particularly its medical devices  the company faces the risk of potentially large product liability claims 
the malfunction or misuse of its products could potentially result in serious harm to a patient 
in addition  the company may be required to indemnify its distributors and customers for similar claims made against them 
claims could be made against the company even if its products did not contribute to the injury that was sustained 
frequently  the company s products are used with products developed by other manufacturers 
even if its products are not the cause of the injury  the company may not be able to prove that some other product malfunction or human error caused a claimant s injury 
the company has had product liability claims made against it in the past and may have further claims made against it in the future 
while the company is insured for certain product liability claims  not all claims will be covered and the level of its insurance may not be sufficient to protect it from the full amount of a successful claim 
in addition  the company may not be able to obtain adequate amounts of insurance at an acceptable cost 
claims made against the company that are not insured  or that exceed the amount of the company s coverage  could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
similarly  the company s products are subject to the potential of being recalled by government agencies for actual or potential deficiencies or problems 
any such recall would likely be expensive and would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company faces increased risks of international operations international sales have accounted for over of the company s sales for each of the past three years and may increase over time 
international sales are subject to a number of risks  including the following fluctuations in exchange rates may affect the demand for products and services the company provides in foreign markets adverse changes in local economic conditions could depress the demand for the company s products agreements may be difficult to enforce and receivables difficult to collect through a foreign country s legal system foreign customers may have longer payment cycles foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax the company s foreign income  impose tariffs  or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade us export licenses may be difficult to obtain the protection of intellectual property in foreign countries may be more difficult than in the united states any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s sales are primarily denominated in us dollars and as a result  the company has relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to its sales 
the company does not currently hedge against exchange foreign currency rate fluctuations 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on the company s future operating results or cash flows
