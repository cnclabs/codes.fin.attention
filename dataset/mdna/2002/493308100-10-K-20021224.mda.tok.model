a majority of our subscription revenue comes from our web performance benchmarking services which includes our perspective services 
subscription revenue also includes our red alert and netmechanic monitoring and alarm services  and our private agent application performance management services

we believe that consulting and support services revenue may increase in the future somewhat as a percentage of total revenue  as we introduce additional services that require consulting expertise and as our keynote diagnostic services are more widely used 
however  we cannot assure you that this revenue will increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
we had total revenue of million for the year ended september   million for the year ended september   and million for the year ended september  we incurred net losses of million for the year ended september   million for the year ended september   and million for the year ended september  during fiscal  we continued to experience a reduction in revenue from internet service provider customers  e commerce and other internet businesses

the increase in revenue in absolute dollars resulted primarily from an increased number of large testing and consulting engagements during fiscal and our new product offering  keynote diagnostic services  that was introduced in november the increase as a percentage of total revenue was due to the decrease in subscription services revenue

for the years ended september  and  no single customer accounted for more than of total revenue 
at september   one customer accounted for more than of total accounts receivable  which receivable was collected subsequent to year end

critical accounting policies and judgments in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  our management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in 
table of contents our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates

for consulting projects that span more than one month  we recognize revenue on a percentage of completion basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable accounts receivable is recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable of approximately million and million as of september  and  respectively 
our accounting policy for our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical trends  experience and current market and industry conditions 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the accounts receivable aging  the age of each invoice  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review all invoices greater than days old to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the receivable balance 
in addition  we maintain a reserve for all other invoices  which is calculated by applying a percentage to the outstanding accounts receivable balance  based on historical collection trends 
based on the amount of accounts receivable written off in prior periods  management believes that it has adequately reserved for doubtful accounts as of the date of each balance sheet presented herein 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents management s best estimate  but changes in circumstances  in the future  relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances or reductions in the allowances due to recoveries in the future

the lease  which was due to expire in  provided for a residual guarantee of a total of million due at the end of the lease term or upon lease termination 
our obligation was fully collateralized with restricted cash of million 
after we entered into the lease in july  real estate market conditions worsened  including significant increases in available space for lease and significant declines in corresponding lease rates for commercial property 
accordingly  a loss on the termination of this lease was recognized in connection with the purchase of the building 
the loss was calculated by comparing the purchase price of the building to its fair value 
to determine the fair value of the building  we had an independent real estate appraisal conducted  which indicated that the fair value of the property was approximately million 
the calculated loss of approximately million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal the million loss on termination was 
table of contents adjusted for the reversal of the remaining excess facility charge accrual and costs associated with the acquisition of the building  resulting in a net charge to the consolidated statements of operations of approximately million 
excess facility costs on september   we recorded an accrual for excess facility costs of approximately million for certain costs related to the unoccupied portion of our headquarters building in san mateo  california 
the accrual included certain direct lease costs such as lease expense  insurance  and property taxes 
other operating costs associated with the unoccupied space was reported as incurred as operating expenses in their respective periods 
the accrual was determined by estimating the lease costs for unleased space over the life of the lease 
management s assumptions and estimates included in determining the excess facility charge were based on expected libor rates for establishing lease rates  expected insurance and property tax costs  and expected sublease rates 
the excess facility accrual did not include any sublease income since we did not have any significant sublease income and did not expect any significant sublease income in the foreseeable future 
the remaining accrual for the unoccupied space was reviewed quarterly including updates to management s assumptions and estimates based on current real estate market conditions 
as mentioned above  on september   the remaining accrual of million for the unoccupied space was reversed as a result of the termination of the synthetic lease arrangement 
impairment assessments of goodwill and identifiable intangibles effective october   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
with our adoption of sfas no 
 we reassessed the useful lives and residual values of all acquired intangible assets to identify any necessary amortization period adjustments and to determine if any amount of identifiable intangible assets should be reclassified to goodwill 
based on that assessment  no adjustments were made to the amortization periods or residual values of identifiable intangible assets 
sfas no 
provides a six month transitional period from the effective date of adoption for us to perform an assessment as to whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired 
to accomplish this  we identified our reporting units and determined the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
we determined that we had one reporting unit 
sfas no 
requires us to determine the fair value of our one reporting unit as of october   and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent that the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we performed the first step of the transitional impairment test required under sfas no 
 and obtained an indicator of impairment in our single reporting unit 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we performed the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  in accordance with sfas no 
 we compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation to its carrying amount  both of which could be measured as of the date of adoption 
we determined the fair value of our single reporting unit using our market capitalization value after adjusting for a control premium and compared it to our carrying value 
we determined our market capitalization value based on the number of shares outstanding and the stock price as of october   adjusting for a premium that is assumed to represent additional value that an acquirer would be required to pay for a controlling interest in the company 
this evaluation indicated that goodwill associated with acquisitions completed prior to fiscal year was impaired as of october  accordingly  we recorded a million non cash impairment charge as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the write off of the remaining goodwill as of october  the charge is reflected in the results for the year ended september  currently  there is no goodwill remaining on our balance sheet 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit of disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting associated with exit or disposal activities 
under sfas no 
 costs associated with an exit or disposal activity shall be recognized and measured at their fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
for all exit and disposal activities initiated after december  we are evaluating the provisions of sfas no 
 but do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt 
accordingly  gains or losses from extinguishment of debt shall not be reported as extraordinary items unless the extinguishment qualifies as an extraordinary item under the criteria of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb no 

gains or losses from extinguishment of debt that do not meet the criteria of apb should be reclassified to income from continuing operations in all prior periods presented 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
in our fiscal year beginning october  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on our financial position and results of operations  but the statement is not expected to have a material impact on reported results since we currently do not have any debt 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
sfas no 
requires companies to separately report discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted sfas no 
on october   and the adoption of sfas no 
did not have any material impact on our financial position or results of operation 

table of contents factors that may impact future operating results we have introduced new products and services  and we have an unproven business model  which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects 
we have introduced many new products and services and released updated versions of existing products since the beginning of fiscal we have only a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of our current business and future prospects 
our recent new product offerings include in october  we acquired the assets of ondevice and introduced our wireless perspective service 
in november  we introduced our keynote diagnostic services and custom perspective service 
in march  we introduced our latest versions of keynote web site perspective service 
in may  we acquired netmechanic  inc  which enhanced the monitoring services that we currently provide through our red alert division 
in july  we released an updated version of our transaction perspective 
in october  we acquired the assets of enviz corporation which we expect will enhance our ability to provide services for testing the total quality of the user experience 
the revenue and income potential of our current business and services and the related markets are unproven 
in addition  because of our new products and services and because the market for web performance management and web performance testing services is rapidly evolving  we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business 
companies such as ours that are in rapidly changing markets  such web performance management and web performance testing services  frequently encounter risks  expenses  and problems 
we have incurred and may in the future continue to incur losses  and we may never achieve profitability 
we have experienced operating losses in each quarterly and annual period since inception and we expect to incur operating losses in the future 
we incurred net losses of million for the year ended september   and as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
in addition  we are required under generally accepted accounting principles to review our identifiable intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as of september   we had approximately million of identifiable intangible assets 
if we complete acquisitions in the future  we may have additional goodwill and or identifiable intangibles and  accordingly  may incur expenses in connection with a write down of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets due to changes in market conditions as we did in the quarter ended june  when we recorded an impairment charge for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of million in connection with our acquisitions of velogic and digital content 
we believe that our operating expenses could continue to increase as they have in certain past periods 
as a result  we will need to increase our revenue to initially achieve and then to sustain profitability 
we may not sustain a sequential quarterly increase in revenue and may never be able to regain our historic revenue growth rates 
the success of our business depends on customers renewing their subscriptions for our services and purchasing additional services 
to maintain and grow our revenues  we must achieve and maintain high customer renewal rates for our services 
our customers have no obligation to renew our services and therefore  they could cease using our services at any time 
in addition  our customers may renew for fewer services 
further  our customers may reduce their use of our services during the term of their subscription 
we cannot project the level of renewal rates 
our customer renewal rates may decline as a result of a number of factors  including consolidations in the internet industry or if a significant number of our customers cease operations 

table of contents further  we depend on sales to new customers and sales of additional services to our existing customers 
renewals by existing customers or purchases of our services by new customers may be limited as companies limit or reduce their technology spending in response to uncertain economic conditions 
during fiscal and fiscal  we experienced a reduction in revenue from internet service providers and internet e commerce web sites 
we may continue to experience a reduction in revenue from this particular type of customer 
we have experienced an increase in cancellations and non renewals in the past and may continue to experience an increased amount of cancellations and or non renewals 
we increased the prices for our perspective services during the third quarter of fiscal as a result  we may experience cancellations and or reduction in service 
if we continue to experience reduced renewal rates or if customers renew for a lesser amount of our services  or if customers  at any time  reduce the amount of services they purchase from us  our revenue could continue to decline unless we are able to obtain additional customers or sources of revenue  sufficient to replace lost revenue 
continued reductions and or cancellations could also result in our inability to collect amounts due 
our quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations  and if our future results are below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the price of our common stock may decline 
results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
if revenues fall below our expectations  we may not be able to reduce our spending rapidly in response to the shortfall 
other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include those described below and elsewhere in this report the rate of new and renewed subscriptions to our services  the amount and timing of any reductions by our customers in their usage of our services  our ability to increase the number of web sites we measure and the scope of services we offer for our existing customers in a particular quarter  our ability to attract new customers in a quarter  particularly larger customers  our ability to successfully introduce new products and services to offset reductions in revenue  the timing and amount of consulting and support services revenue  the timing and amount of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion or contraction of our domestic and international operations infrastructure  the timing and amount  if any  of impairment charges related to potential write down of acquired assets in acquisitions  and the timing and amount  if any  of restructuring costs if we are required to further restructure our operations  due to these and other factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of our future performance 
it is possible that in some future periods  our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock may decline 
our operating results depend on sales of our web performance benchmarking services 
sales of our web performance benchmarking services  primarily our web site perspective business edition services  and  to a lesser degree  transaction perspective have generated the substantial majority of our total revenue 
therefore  the success of our business currently depends  and for the immediate future will continue to substantially depend  on sales and renewals of our benchmarking services 
we have recently increased the prices of all of our perspective services  which could reduce demand for these services 
this could result in decreased sales  which would cause our revenues to decline 

table of contents if one of our competitors internet performance measurement service is adopted as the industry standard for measuring the speed and reliability of web sites  we may lose existing customers or encounter difficulties in attracting new customers 
to date  no internet performance measurement service has been adopted as an accepted industry standard for measuring the speed and reliability of web sites 
as a result  if one of our current or potential competitors develops an internet performance measurement product or service that is adopted as the industry standard  our customers may turn to the products or services provided by these competitors 
in addition  it would be more difficult for us to attract the additional customers for our internet performance measurement services that are necessary for our business to grow 
if this were to occur  our business would be harmed 
improvements to the infrastructure of the internet could reduce or eliminate demand for our internet performance measurement services 
the demand for our internet performance measurement services could be reduced or eliminated if future improvements to the infrastructure of the internet lead companies to conclude that the measurement and evaluation of the performance of their web sites is no longer important to their business 
because the inherent complexity of the internet currently causes significant quality of service problems for e business companies  the vendors and operators that supply and manage the underlying infrastructure are continuously seeking to improve the speed  availability  reliability and consistency of the internet 
if these vendors and operators succeed in significantly improving the performance of the internet  which would result in corresponding improvements in the performance of companies web sites  demand for our services would likely decline which would harm our operating results 
the inability of our services to perform properly could result in loss of or delay in revenues  injury to our reputation or other harm to our business 
we offer complex services  which may not perform at the level our customers expect 
we have  from time to time  given credits to customers as a result of past problems with our service 
despite our testing  our existing or future services may not perform as expected due to unforeseen problems  which could result in loss of or delay in revenues  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  increased insurance costs or increased service costs 
these problems could also result in tort or warranty claims 
although we attempt to reduce the risk of losses resulting from any claims through warranty disclaimers and liability limitation clauses in our customer agreements  these contractual provisions may not be enforceable in every instance 
furthermore  although we maintain errors and omissions insurance  this insurance coverage may not adequately cover us for claims 
if a court refused to enforce the liability limiting provisions of our contracts for any reason  or if liabilities arose that were not contractually limited or adequately covered by insurance  we could be required to pay damages 
if we do not continually improve our services in response to technological changes  including changes to the internet  we may encounter difficulties retaining existing customers and attracting new customers 
the ongoing evolution of the internet requires us to continually improve the functionality  features and reliability of our web performance management and web performance testing services  particularly in response to offerings of our competitors 
if we do not succeed in developing and marketing new services that respond to competitive and technological developments and changing customer needs  we may encounter difficulties retaining existing customers and attracting new customers 
we must also introduce any new internet services as quickly as possible 
the success of new services depends on several factors  including proper definition of the scope of the new services and timely completion  introduction and market acceptance of our new services 
if new internet  networking or telecommunication technologies or standards are widely adopted or if other technological changes occur  we may need to expend significant resources to adapt our services to these 

table of contents our services and brand name might not attain the brand awareness necessary for our business to succeed 
we believe that maintaining and strengthening the keynote brand in a cost effective manner is an important aspect of our business and an important element in attracting new customers 
in the past  our efforts to build our brand have involved significant expense 
we may not be successful in building our brand in a cost effective manner 
if our brand building strategy is unsuccessful  we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand building efforts 
we face competition that could make it difficult for us to acquire and retain customers 
the market for web performance benchmarking  testing  and application performance management services is rapidly evolving 
our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services that they offer 
we face competition from companies that offer software and services with features similar to our services such as mercury interactive  gomez advisors  segue software  watchfire and a variety of small companies that offer a combination of testing  market research capabilities and data 
while we believe these services are not as comprehensive as ours  customers could still choose to use these services or these companies could enhance their services to offer all of the features we offer 
as we expand the scope of our products and services  we expect to encounter many additional market specific competitors 
we could also face competition from other companies  which currently do not offer services similar to our services  but offer software or services related to web performance benchmarking  testing  and application performance management  such as webcriteria  mids matrix iq service  and ins insoft division  an unit of lucent technologies  and free services that measure web site availability  including internet weather report  a unit of mids matrix iq service 
in addition  companies that sell systems management software  such as bmc software  compuware  ca unicenter  hp openview  quest software  netiq  precise software and ibm s tivoli unit  with some of whom we have strategic relationships  could choose to offer services similar to ours 
in the future  we intend to expand our service offerings and to continue to measure the impact of new internet technologies such as internet telephony  wireless networking  and web services  and as a result  could face competition from other companies 
some of our existing and future competitors have or may have longer operating histories  larger customer bases  greater brand recognition in similar businesses  and significantly greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources 
in addition  some of our competitors may be able to devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns  to adopt more aggressive pricing policies  and to devote substantially more resources to technology and systems development 
increased competition may result in price reductions  increased costs of providing our services and loss of market share  any of which could seriously harm our business 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenues  and the loss of a major customer could harm our operating results 
ten customers accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues for the years ended september    and  respectively 
one customer accounted for approximately of our total revenue for the year ended september  this concentration may continue in the future 
we cannot be certain that customers that have accounted for significant revenues in past periods  individually or as a group  will renew  will not cancel or will not reduce their services and  therefore  continue to generate revenue in any future period 
in addition  our customers that do not have written contracts may terminate their services at any time with little or no penalty 
if we lose a major customer  our revenues could decline 

table of contents to grow our business  we must expand our direct sales force and establish and maintain relationships with other companies to help market our web performance management and web performance testing services 
to increase sales of our web performance management and web performance testing services worldwide  we must expand and complement our direct sales force with relationships with companies to market and sell our services to their customers 
if we are unable to maintain our existing marketing and distribution relationships  or fail to enter into additional relationships  we will have to devote substantially more resources to the direct sale and marketing of our services 
we would also lose anticipated revenues from customer referrals and other co marketing benefits 
for example  in fiscal  we terminated relationships with two of our international resellers 
as a result  we are investing time and resources in evaluating replacements for these resellers and are committing resources to the expansion of our direct sales effort in the united kingdom 
our success depends in part on the ultimate success of these relationships and the ability of these companies to market and sell our services 
our existing relationships do not  and any future relationships may not  afford us any exclusive marketing or distribution rights 
therefore  they could reduce their commitment to us at any time in the future 
many of these companies have multiple relationships and they may not regard us as significant for their business 
in addition  these companies generally may terminate their relationships with us  pursue other relationships with our competitors or develop or acquire products or services that compete with our services 
even if we succeed in entering into these relationships  they may not result in additional customers or revenues 
to grow our business  we must retain qualified personnel in a competitive marketplace 
we may be unable to retain our key employees  namely our management team and experienced engineers  or to attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees 
although we  and a number of other technology companies  have implemented workforce reductions  there remains substantial competition for highly skilled employees 
our key employees are not bound by agreements that could prevent them from terminating their employment at any time 
if the market does not accept our professional services  our results of operations could be harmed 
we formed our application performance management services organization in january and have expanded our service offerings to include additional consulting and support services 
we have limited experience in delivering consulting and support services and we may not be able to successfully introduce additional consulting and support services 
consulting and other support services represented approximately of total revenues for the year ended september  in addition  our cost of consulting and support services has exceeded our consulting revenue for all periods except for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal we expect that the costs of consulting and support services as a percentage of consulting and support services revenue will be greater than the costs of subscription services as a percentage of subscription services revenue 
we also expect that costs of consulting and support services in absolute dollars could increase slightly in subsequent quarters for the foreseeable future 
we will also need to successfully market these services to potential customers in order to increase revenue 
there are many experienced firms which offer computer network and internet related consulting services 
these consulting services providers include consulting companies  such as accenture and ernst young  as well as consulting divisions of large technology companies such as ibm 
because we do not have an established reputation for delivering consulting services  because this area is very competitive  and due to our limited experience in delivering consulting services  we may not succeed in selling these services 
because we have expanded our operations  our success will depend on our ability to manage our growth  improve our existing systems and implement new systems  procedures and controls 
we intend to continue to expand our operations by deploying additional measurement computers  both domestically and internationally  hiring new personnel and implementing and integrating new accounting and control systems to manage this expansion 
in addition  we have completed several acquisitions of businesses and 
table of contents assets since the beginning of fiscal  including the acquisition of certain assets of enviz  inc in october we may encounter difficulties in managing this growth and integrating the operations of these and additional services and personnel we may acquire 
our ability to compete effectively and to manage any future expansion of our operations will require continual improvement of our financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures on a timely basis 
we may not succeed in these efforts and a disruption could impair our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers 
the success of our business depends on the continued use of the internet by business and consumers for e business and communications 
because our business is based on providing web performance management and web performance testing services  the internet must continue to be used as a means of electronic business  or e business  and communications 
in addition  we believe that the use of the internet for conducting business transactions could be hindered for a number of reasons  including  but not limited to security concerns including the potential for fraud or theft of stored data and information communicated over the internet  inconsistent quality of service  including well publicized outages of popular web sites  lack of availability of cost effective  high speed services  limited numbers of local access points for corporate users  delay in the development of enabling technologies or adoption of new standards  inability to integrate business applications with the internet  the need to operate with multiple and frequently incompatible products  and a lack of tools to simplify access to and use of the internet 
our network infrastructure could be disrupted by a number of different occurrences  which could impair our ability to serve and retain existing customers or attract new customers 
all data collected from our measurement computers are stored in and distributed from our operations center  which we maintain at a single location 
therefore  our operations depend upon our ability to maintain and protect our computer systems  most of which are located at our corporate headquarters in san mateo  california  which is an area susceptible to earthquakes and possible power outages 
if we experience power outages at our operations center  we would not be able to receive data from our measurement computers and we would not be able to deliver our services to our customers on a timely basis 
we plan to develop a redundant system for computer network and other services at an alternate site  and have begun a generator project to provide our own source of long term uninterruptible power 
however  we do not currently have and may never develop a redundant system  and we now currently have only short term power back up capability 
various factors could cause us to not be able to ever develop such systems 
therefore  our operations systems are vulnerable to damage from break ins  computer viruses  unauthorized access  vandalism  fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures and similar events 
although we maintain insurance against fires  earthquakes and general business interruptions  the amount of coverage may not be adequate in any particular case 
if our operations center is damaged  causing a disruption in our services  this could impair our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers 
if our computer infrastructure is not functioning properly  we may not be able to deliver our services in a timely or accurate manner 
we have occasionally experienced outages of our service in the past  the last of which occurred in october the outages that we have experienced have lasted no more than a few hours 
these outages have been caused by a variety of factors including electrical distribution equipment malfunctions  
table of contents operator error  the failure of a back up computer to operate when the primary computer ceased functioning and power outages due to our previous facility s being inadequately equipped to house our operations center 
any outage for any period of time or loss of customer data could cause us to lose customers 
individuals who attempt to breach our network security  such as hackers  could  if successful  misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services 
although we have recently had a breach of our security through what appears to be unauthorized access to certain data belonging to one of our customers  we have not yet experienced any breaches of our network security or sabotage that has prevented us from serving our customers 
we might be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against  or to alleviate  problems caused by hackers 
we may not have a timely remedy against a hacker who is able to breach our network security 
in addition to intentional security breaches  the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could expose us to litigation or to a material risk of loss 
our measurement computers are located at sites  which we do not own or operate  and it could be difficult for us to maintain or repair them if they do not function properly 
our measurement computers are located at facilities that are not owned by our customers or us 
instead  these computers are installed at locations near various internet access points worldwide 
although we operate these computers remotely from our san mateo  california operations center  we do not own or operate the facilities  we have little control over how these computers are maintained on a day to day basis 
we do not have long term contractual relationships with the companies that operate the facilities where our measurement computers are located 
we may have to find new locations for these computers if we are unable to develop relationships with these companies or if these companies cease their operations as some have done due to bankruptcies or are acquired 
in addition  if our measurement computers cease to function properly  we may not be able to repair or service these computers on a timely basis  as we may not have immediate access to our measurement computers 
our ability to collect data in a timely manner could be impaired if we are unable to maintain and repair our computers should performance problems arise 
others might bring infringement claims against us or our suppliers that could harm our business 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
we could become subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and our services overlap with competitive offerings 
these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive and divert management s attention from operating our company 
if we become liable to others for infringement of their intellectual property rights  we would be required to pay a substantial damage award and to develop noninfringing technology  obtain a license or cease selling the services that contain the infringing intellectual property 
we may be unable to develop non infringing technology or to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
as we expand our international activities  our business will be susceptible to additional risks associated with international operations 
we believe we must expand the sales of our services outside the united states and hire additional international personnel 
to date  we have little experience with direct sales outside the united states  and we may not succeed in these efforts 
international sales were approximately of our total revenue for both the years ended september  and  respectively 
we intend to expand the sales of our services by selling directly to our customers in the united kingdom 
therefore  we expect to commit resources to expand our international sales and marketing activities 
conducting international operations would subject us to risks we do not face in the united states 
these include currency exchange rate fluctuations  
table of contents seasonal fluctuations in purchasing patterns  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  maintaining and servicing computer hardware in distant locations  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  difficulties in managing and staffing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 
the internet may not be used as widely in other countries and the adoption of e business may evolve slowly or may not evolve at all 
as a result  we may not be successful in selling our services to customers in markets outside the united states 
we may face difficulties assimilating our acquisitions and may incur costs associated with any future acquisitions 
we have completed several acquisitions  and as a part of our business strategy  we may seek to acquire or invest in additional businesses  products or technologies that we feel could complement or expand our business  augment our market coverage  enhance our technical capabilities or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
future acquisitions could create risks for us  including difficulties in assimilating acquired personnel  operations and technologies  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  adverse effects on existing business relationships with resellers of our service and our customers  difficulties in managing geographically dispersed businesses  the need to integrate or enhance the systems of an acquired business  impairment charges related to potential write down of acquired assets in acquisitions  failure to realize any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition  and use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition and or operate the acquired business 
our future operating results could be harmed if we are unable to lease a major portion of the space in our corporate headquarters building or if the fair value of this property decreases further 
we estimate that we will need to lease the unoccupied portion  or approximately  of our headquarters building in san mateo  california 
we may be unable to lease all or a part of the available space  and if it is leased  we may not receive sufficiently high rental rates to cover our building operating costs 
in addition  we have previously incurred a charge for the write down of the building  and  if the real estate market continues to deteriorate  we may incur charges for future write downs 
any such charge could harm our results of operations 
compliance with new rules and regulations concerning corporate governance may be costly and could harm our business 
the sarbanes oxley act  which was signed into law in july  mandates  among other things  that companies adopt new corporate governance measures and imposes comprehensive reporting and disclosure 
table of contents requirements  sets stricter independence and financial expertise standards for audit committee members and imposes increased civil and criminal penalties for companies  their chief executive officers and chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations 
in addition  the nasdaq stock market  on which our common stock is listed  is also considering the adoption of additional comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance 
these laws  rules and regulations will increase the scope  complexity and cost of our corporate governance  reporting and disclosure practices  which could harm our results of operations and divert management s attention from business operations 
we also expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
further  our board members  chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  we may have difficultly attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers  which would adversely affect our business 
terrorist attacks and threats  and government responses thereto  may negatively impact all aspects of our operations  revenues  costs and stock price 
the terrorist attacks in the united states  the us retaliation for these attacks  the threats of war in iraq and the related decline in consumer confidence and continued economic weakness have had a substantial adverse impact on our retail sales 
recent consumer reports indicate that consumer confidence has reached its lowest level since if consumer confidence continues to decline or does not recover  our revenues and results of operations may be adversely impacted for the remainder of fiscal and beyond 
any escalation in these events or similar future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers and suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers 
in addition  these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular  which could harm our sales 
any of these events could increase volatility in the us and world financial markets  which could harm our stock price and may limit the capital resources available to us and our customers or suppliers

interest rate sensitivity 
our interest income and expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because most of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are invested in short term debt instruments
