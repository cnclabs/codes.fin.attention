liquidity and sources of capital because of the seasonal nature of the toy business  the company normally requires a substantial build up in working capital from the beginning of the year to a seasonal peak during the third quarter 
extended payment terms are in general use in the toy industry to encourage earlier shipments of merchandise required for selling during the christmas season 
as a result  the company s working capital requirements typically increase with seasonal shipments as collection of a substantial portion of accounts receivable is deferred until the fourth quarter 
this increased working capital requirement has been financed in recent years by borrowings under a revolving line of credit

the company was not in compliance with the minimum tangible net worth covenant included in its loan and security agreement at january  this event of default was subsequently waived by the lender unconditionally

while successful in reducing risk  the company s overall claims experience has continued to rise along with the general increase in the cost of health related services 
insurance premiums for fiscal are expected to be higher than in fiscal in recent years a higher percentage of component parts used in the company s products have been purchased from sources outside of the united states 
changes in product mix in   and resulted in only a small portion of these purchases being committed in foreign currencies and therefore only minor exposure to exchange risk 
some of the primary raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s products are petrochemical derivative plastics 
costs of these raw materials are closely tied to the price of oil 
costs rose substantially in fiscal  but were relatively constant throughout fiscal during a period of rapidly rising costs the company is not able to fully recover cost increases through price increases due to competitive conditions and trade practices 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings and cash flow are not directly affected by foreign currency exchange since nearly all purchases and sales are made in us currency 
however  the company could be affected indirectly  either positively or negatively  since the majority of its toy products are manufactured by unrelated vendors overseas and the price of the products is influenced by the foreign exchange rate 
the company s interest expense is sensitive to the level of the us prime rate as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is not a party to any material derivative financial instruments
