item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we commenced our restaurant operations in may with the acquisition of four tgi friday s restaurants in arizona and nevada 
during the past eleven years  we have grown through acquisitions and development of new restaurants 
we currently own restaurants and manage an additional five restaurants 
during  we had a change in management and implemented a long term business strategy to enhance our financial position  to place more emphasis on our casual dining business in certain designated areas  and to dispose of underperforming assets 
the first step was to strengthen our financial position 
this was accomplished by i the sale of  shares of common stock for  through a private placement transaction in january  ii the sale of five restaurants in northern california in january for  of which  in proceeds were used to repay debt  and iii new borrowings of  with a repayment period of years 
proceeds from the new borrowings were used primarily to pay off debt with shorter repayment periods 
we also renegotiated our development agreements with carlson restaurants worldwide  inc to reduce the number of tgi friday s restaurants we were required to build with the intent to focus on those development territories that were most economically favorable 
in addition  we recorded net restructuring and reorganization gains of  in and  in related to the disposition of various non core assets and the write down of certain core assets to realizable values 
after these steps  we strengthened our operation and commenced expansion plans  principally through developing tgi friday s restaurants 
this expansion was financed by borrowings from various lenders 
the next step was taken in with the acquisition of our redfish restaurants and concept and in with the acquisition of the bamboo club restaurants and concept 
the bamboo club acquisition was financed in part by our rights offering to stockholders in in  we entered into a new loan with bank of america in the amount of  which we believe will be sufficient to fund all of the tgi friday s restaurants we plan to complete by june we executed an interest rate swap and locked in our interest rate on  of the loan total 
we believe that this is a favorable rate  as our existing financing is at a higher rate  and that this portion of the loan will be sufficient to fund our current construction and expansion of tgi friday s restaurants for the next months 
the interest rate is performance based and indexed to the libor rate plus a predetermined spread based upon our adjusted senior funded debt as defined in the loan documents to ebitda 
the interest rate is currently 
the interest rate swap qualifies as a cash flow hedge in accordance with sfas no 
on a periodic basis  we will adjust the fair market value of the swap on the balance sheet and offset the amount of the change to other comprehensive income 
in  operations were impacted by soft economic conditions  especially in the fourth quarter and subsequent to the september th attacks on america 
these conditions halted our positive same store sales increase record at consecutive quarters and predicated the fourth quarter impairment write down of five company owned restaurants and the management agreement impairment write down for six stores we manage in northern california and el paso  texas 
the total impairment charges were  of which  related to company owned assets and  related to the management agreement impairment 
we also faced two distinctive challenges in our tg i 
friday s california market  which affected operational profitability  a per hour minimum wage increase effective january  and controlling the escalating utility prices 
to effectively combat these challenges  we implemented a new labor program for our top store managers to manage multiple locations  where it was geographically efficient  and we implemented utility programs to measure optimum usage and to ensure cost efficiency 
we opened seven new restaurants in  including three tgifriday s  one redfish and three bamboo club locations 
the new tg i 
friday s restaurants are located in west albuquerque  new mexico  roseville  california sacramento area  and porter ranch  california los angeles area 
the new redfish restaurant is located in north scottsdale  arizona  and the new bamboo club restaurants are located in tampa  florida  wellington  florida west palm beach area  and tempe  arizona phoenix area 
we closed an under performing tg i 
friday s restaurant in el paso  texas 
we will convert an underperforming redfish restaurant in cleveland  ohio to another concept in the new concept is alice cooper stown  a rock n roll sports themed restaurant  will debut to coincide with the opening of the major league baseball season in april the restaurant is located near jacobs field  home of the cleveland indians and the rock n roll hall of fame 
our strategy is to continue reducing operating costs and expand our restaurant operations 
this will entail continuing to build tgi friday s  redfish  and bamboo club restaurants and evaluating other concepts in the casual dining segment 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different future conditions 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of the our financial condition and results of operations  in that they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical to our operations 
these critical accounting policies relate to the valuation and amortizable lives of long lived assets  goodwill and to other identifiable intangible assets  valuation of deferred tax assets and reserves related to self insurance 
we periodically perform asset impairment analysis of long lived assets related to our restaurant locations  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we use an actuarial based methodology utilizing historical experience factors to periodically adjust self insurance reserves 
we believe estimates and assumptions related to these critical accounting policies are appropriate under the circumstances  however  should future events or occurrences result in unanticipated consequences  there could be a material impact on our future financial condition or results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentages that certain items of income and expense bear to total revenue fiscal year ended december  december  december  revenue restaurant operating expenses cost of sales payroll and benefits depreciation and amortization other operating expenses reduction of disputed liabilities total restaurant operating expenses income from restaurant operations amortization of intangibles general and administrative expenses preopening expenses new manager training expenses impairment charges and other management fee income operating income interest expense and other  net income loss before income taxes  extraordinary loss  and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue for the fiscal year ended december  increased to million compared with million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of opening seven new restaurants in and seven new restaurants in same store sales increased for fiscal as compared with an increase in same store sales of for the comparable period in revenue from alcoholic beverages accounted for of revenue in and in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from in this decrease from the comparable period in resulted from multiple factors 
food costs were higher in because we were required to find alternative food suppliers to replace ameriserve  our primary food supplier who declared bankruptcy in the first quarter of additionally  we experienced increased food costs in due to sales mix changes and increases in meat and cheese costs 
we offset these increases through improved operations  better margins on alcohol sales and maturing relationships with our suppliers that have led to more favorable contract terms 
payroll and benefit costs increased as a percentage of revenue to in from for the comparable period in this increase was primarily due to the per hour minimum wage increase in our california market effective january  and higher management labor and benefits resulting from lower turnover 
in total  depreciation and amortization increased as a percentage of revenue to in from for the comparable period in the increase was due primarily to the number of new restaurants we have opened in and other operating expenses include rent  real estate taxes  common area maintenance charges  advertising  insurance  maintenance  and utilities 
in addition  the franchise agreements between carlson restaurants worldwide  and our company require a of net sales royalty and a of net sales marketing contribution 
each year we contribute to a tgi friday s national marketing pool 
in  the pool contribution was of net sales 
in  the pool contribution was of net sales for the first three fiscal quarters and of net sales for the fourth quarter 
the pool contribution percentage decreased because carlson restaurants worldwide cancelled its tgi friday s national advertising campaign for the entire fourth quarter 
this contribution offsets a portion of our general marketing requirement 
other operating expenses increased as a percentage of revenue to in from for the comparable period in the increase was due primarily to additional unit level advertising efforts  store rent increases  and additional energy and workers compensation costs  especially in california 
reduction of disputed liabilities in represents the one time settlement proceeds paid to us for the ameriserve bankruptcy claim 
ameriserve was our primary food supplier until they declared bankruptcy in the first quarter of amortization of intangible expenses include amortization on capitalized liquor licenses  loan financing fees  franchise fees  and goodwill 
these amortization expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue to in from for the comparable period in the decrease in was primarily due to spreading a small increase in fixed expenses over a larger revenue base 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue to in from compared with the comparable period in the decrease was primarily due to reduced legal fees and recruiting expenses as we hired both an in house attorney and recruiter during in addition  reduction in travel expenses related to postponing all non mandatory travel during the fourth quarter after the events of september contributed to the overall decrease 
pre opening expenses of  or of revenue  were charged to operations during the year ended december  as compared to  or of revenue  being charged to operations during the year ended december  the increase was due to opening of two bamboo clubs outside of our phoenix  arizona market central florida that resulted in additional travel expenses for our new store opening teams 
new manager training expenses are those costs incurred in training newly hired or promoted managers  as well as those costs incurred to relocate those managers to permanent management positions 
these expenses decreased to  or of revenue  for the year ended december  as compared to  or of revenue  for the year ended december  primarily as a result of lower turnover 
in and  impairment charges and other included the impairment of certain leasehold improvements and other operating assets in accordance with sfas no 
the charges amounted to  and  in and  respectively to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value 
in addition  we recorded an impairment expense of  in the fourth quarter of against a management agreement with cnl for six under performing locations we manage in northern california and one location in el paso  texas 
other charges in included the final settlement proceeds of  net  received from the city and county of san francisco  california in connection with condemnation proceedings against a company owned restaurant 
management fee income represents of store gross revenue charged to five tgi friday s locations we manage in northern california and one location in el paso  texas for cnl 
based on the impairment of the management agreement in the fourth quarter of  we did not record any management fee income for the fourth quarter of interest expense and other  net was approximately  in compared with  in the net expense decreased as a percentage of revenue to in from for the comparable period in although we incurred additional debt and a subsequent increase in interest expense in  the increased expenses compared with were offset by more favorable interest rate conditions on our variable interest rate debt 
as of december   approximately of our total debt is tied to variable interest rates 
an income tax benefit of  was recorded in because we offset net operating loss carryforwards against taxable income 
we were in a taxable income situation in due to the recognition of various timing differences from in  we recorded a  expense related to state income taxes due in certain states where net operating loss carryforwards are no longer available to us 
at december   we had approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards including capital loss carryforwards available to offset future income for federal income tax purposes 
fiscal compared with fiscal revenue for the fiscal year ended december  increased to million compared with million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of opening new restaurants in and seven new restaurants in same store sales increased for fiscal as compared with an increase in same store sales of for the prior year 
additionally  we purchased the two bamboo club restaurants in july revenue from alcoholic beverages accounted for of revenue for both the fiscal years 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenue increased to in from in this increase was due primarily to supply interruption of our food and related items 
we replaced our major supplier during the year 
much of our loss was recouped from the past supplier 
labor costs decreased as a percentage of revenue to in from in this decrease was primarily due to a maturing of the restaurants we opened in once a restaurant has reached operating maturity  labor costs  as a percentage of revenue  are normalized 
additionally  during we implemented a program to increase our restaurant management staff in many of our restaurants from four to five managers 
this increase in management staff has had the effect of reducing turnover by improving the quality of life of our managers  which we believe has ultimately led to lower labor costs 
other operating expenses include rent  real estate taxes  common area maintenance charges  advertising  insurance  maintenance  and utilities 
in addition  the franchise agreements between carlson restaurants worldwide  and our company require a of net sales royalty and a of net sales marketing contribution

other operating expenses increased as a percentage of revenue to in from in the increase was due primarily to additional energy and workers compensation costs  especially in california 
in total  depreciation and amortization increased as a percentage of revenue to in from in the increase was due primarily to the number of new restaurants we opened in and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue of in is the same as the percentage 
we have made a significant effort to keep this expense in line 
improved expense control  tight control on head count  and a larger revenue base over which to spread some fixed expenses helped us maintain this expense  as a percentage of sales  at last year s level 
pre opening expenses of  or of revenue  were charged to operations during the year ended december  as compared to  or of revenue  being charged to operations during the year ended december  new manager training expenses are those costs incurred in training newly hired or promoted managers  as well as those costs incurred to relocate those managers to permanent management positions 
these expenses increased to  or of revenue  for the year ended december  as compared to  or of revenue  for the year ended december  in  we concluded by either payment or settlement the legal and condemnation issues that were reserved for in our provision for non recurring and projected losses 
concluded items created the net decrease in the reserve for losses account of  leaving a balance of  on december  to cover three minor contingencies 
interest expense was approximately  in compared with  in this increase was due to debt incurred in the development of new restaurants and generally higher interest rates for much of an income tax provision of  was recorded in because of the potential income tax exposure in several of the states in which we operate 
in  we recorded a  expense related to state income taxes due in certain states where net operating losses are no longer available to us 
at december   we had approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards as well as capital loss carryforwards and tax credits available to offset future income for federal income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources our primary use of funds over the past five years has been for the acquisition of existing tgi friday s restaurants  the development of new tgi friday s restaurants  and the acquisition and development of the redfish and bamboo club restaurants and concepts 
these acquisitions were financed principally through new stock issuance and the issuance of long term debt and internally generated cash 
in  we entered into a  development facility financing agreement with bank of america 
for a period of months  bank of america will provide construction and permanent financing for certain tgi friday s units and equipment 
in  we purchased the remaining minority interest in redfish america  llc for  in cash and two bamboo club restaurant operations and the bamboo club name and concept for approximately  in cash 
we financed the acquisition of the bamboo club restaurants with approximately million from available cash resources and million of short term debt from one of our lenders 
on october   we completed our stockholder rights offering by issuing  additional shares  or the maximum number available to our qualified stockholders 
the net proceeds of  were used to repay the million short term debt and the remaining million is being used to fund future new restaurant development 
net cash flows from operating activities were  in  and  in these were supplemented by net cash flows from financing of  in   in  and  in  which we used to fund our acquisitions and development of new restaurants 
net cash used in investing activities was  in   in and  in  which we used primarily to fund property and equipment purchases for our new restaurants and to acquire franchise rights and goodwill related to both the purchase and opening of new restaurants 
these amounts were offset by cash received from the sale of assets related to our sale leaseback transactions 
our current liabilities exceed our current assets due in part to cash expended on our development requirements and because the restaurant business receives substantially immediate payment for sales  while payables related to inventories and other current liabilities normally carry longer payment terms  usually to days 
at december   we had a working capital deficit of approximately  at december   we had a cash balance of  monthly cash receipts have been sufficient to pay all obligations as they become due 
at december   we had long term debt of  and current portion of long term debt of  approximately  of this debt is a term loan comprised of five notes payable to one lender 
three of the notes bear interest at per annum and two of the notes bear interest at the one month libor rate plus basis points 
the notes are payable in equal monthly installments of principal and interest that total approximately  per month 
the notes mature on may  during april  we obtained a million revolving line of credit with another lender 
the line of credit is available to finance construction and other costs associated with developing new restaurants 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at bank prime plus basis points 
the line of credit includes covenants related to our net worth  fixed charge coverage ratio  profitability  and access to capital 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  the line of credit matures on july  at december   we had no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit 
during november  we entered into two working capital revolving loan agreements with another lender 
one agreement provides for a maximum of  to finance of the costs to develop seven tgi friday s restaurants 
borrowings under this agreement will mature in years 
these borrowings are secured by the assets financed with the borrowings and are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries 
the other agreement provides for a maximum of  to finance of the costs to furnish and equip seven tgi friday s restaurants 
borrowings under this agreement are secured by the assets financed with the borrowings and will mature in seven years 
borrowings under both agreements bear interest at over the day dealer commercial paper rate  as defined in the agreements  or a combined rate of at december  at december   we had outstanding borrowings of  under these agreements 
these agreements include covenants related to our fixed charge coverage ratio and debt to adjusted cash flow ratio 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  and december  the remainder of our long term debt consists of notes payable to various lending institutions 
these notes bear interest at rates ranging from to and mature at various times over the next years 
we plan to develop at least eleven additional restaurants during fiscal subsequent to december   we borrowed an additional  under the  facility financing agreement with bank of america described above  but we have not entered into any new credit arrangements after december  as of march   we have permanent debt financing commitments totaling approximately  that we will use to fund restaurant development activity and working capital requirements through the remainder of the previously discussed  bank of america development line makes up this remaining commitment 
we lease all of our restaurants with terms ranging from to years 
minimum payments on our existing lease obligations are approximately million in and million per year through the company s future debt and lease obligations are summarized by year as follows debt minimum lease total cash maturities commitments obligations thereafter    we believe that our current resources  our lines of credit  and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our capital needs during the next months at our anticipated level of new restaurant development 
we may be required to obtain additional capital to fund our planned growth after april potential sources of any such capital may include bank financing  strategic alliances  and additional offerings of our equity or debt securities 
we cannot provide assurance that such capital will be available from these or other potential sources  and the lack of capital could have a material adverse effect on our business 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after june  statement also specifies criteria intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
upon its initial adoption  statement eliminates the amortization of all existing and newly acquired goodwill on a prospective basis and requires companies to assess goodwill impairment  at least annually  based on the fair value of the reporting unit 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of statement immediately 
as of the date of adoption  the company will have unamortized goodwill in the amount of  that will be subject to the transition provisions of statements and accumulated amortization related to goodwill is  as of december  because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting statements and  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these statements on the company s financial statements at the date of this report  including whether any transitional impairment losses will be required to be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
on october   the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while statement no 
supersedes statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that statement 
statement no 
also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  it retains the requirement in opinion no 
to report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
by broadening the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions  the fasb has enhanced managements ability to provide information that helps financial statement users to assess the effects of a disposal transaction on the ongoing operations of an entity 
statement no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  at the current time  management does not believe that the adoption of this statement on january  will have a material impact on the company s financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we were participating in a derivative financial instrument for which fair value disclosure is required under sfas no 
from inception  we have reduced the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements to a liability of  using hedge accounting per sfas no 
as a result of the recent decline in interest rates 
we have no other derivative financial instruments 
our market risk exposure is limited to interest rate risk associated with our credit instruments 
we incur interest on loans made at variable interest rates of prime less  over prime  over libor  over libor  over day dealer commercial paper rates  and over day dealer commercial paper rates 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings on these loans of approximately  our net interest expense for was  a one percent variation on any of variable rates would have increased or decreased our total interest expense by  for the year
