table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain of the company s accounting policies are critical to understanding its financial statements because their application places significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management believes that the critical accounting policies described in the following paragraphs affect the most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
for these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as estimated  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
credit risk the company sells products to a variety of customers and extends credit based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition  generally without requiring collateral 
exposure to losses on receivables varies by customer principally due to the financial condition of each customer 
the company monitors its exposure to credit losses and maintains allowances for anticipated losses 
impairment of long lived assets all long lived assets  excluding goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization  are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair market value based on the best information available 
estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting future cash flows 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or sooner in accordance with sfas no 
and an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is greater than its fair value 
income taxes the company s effective income tax rate and the tax bases of its assets and liabilities are based on management s estimate of taxes which will ultimately be payable 
deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
valuation allowances are established when it is deemed  more likely than not  that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
insurance programs the company maintains self insured and deductible programs for certain liability  medical and workers compensation exposures 
the company accrues for known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance  based on actuarial assumptions and historical claim experience

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks to which the company is exposed are commodity prices and interest rates 
commodities the company purchases various raw materials that fluctuate based on commodity market conditions 
these include aluminum cans  high fructose corn syrup  and various juice concentrates
