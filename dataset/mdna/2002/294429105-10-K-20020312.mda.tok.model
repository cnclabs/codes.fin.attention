the company  through its consumer direct business  provides credit reporting and identity theft monitoring services direct to consumers enabling them to proactively manage their credit health and safeguard against identity theft 
the company is the market leader for credit information services in north america 
equifax inc s financial reporting was significantly impacted by the spin off of its payment services business certegy  divestitures of non core businesses divested operations  and restructuring and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of excluding these transactions  equifax reported record revenues  earnings and cash flow for its core business  largely attributable to performance in its north american information services businesses

us consumer reporting volumes grew 
the consumer direct business more than tripled revenues 
free cash flow grew to million  a increase over significant transactions on july   equifax completed the spin off of certegy into a separate  publicly traded company 
the spin off permitted both companies to focus on growth in their core businesses with dedicated resources  and the continued creation of shareholder value 
as a result of the spin off  the company s financial statements have been prepared with certegy s net assets  results of operations and cash flows classified as discontinued operations  with all historical financial statements restated to conform to this presentation

the operating results of these businesses are classified in divested operations for segment reporting purposes 
in the fourth quarter of  restructuring and other charges were recorded in connection with efforts to properly size and configure our post spin business and to align our cost structure in our international operations 
the charge totaled million million after tax or per diluted share and consisted of approximately million for employee severance and facilities consolidation and million to write down several technology investments

adjustments to reconcile the as reported results for each of the three years in the period ended december  to the core business results and the associated impact on diluted earnings per share are as follows exclude the operating results and disposition gains and losses of divested operations exclude the restructuring and other charges adjust other income and interest expense to reflect the impact of the proceeds from divested operations adjust the effective income tax rate  which reflects the above adjustments see exhibit to this report for a more detailed analysis of the reconciling adjustments for core business results of operations

the sale of the risk management and vehicle information businesses generated pre tax losses of million in in  the company sold three risk management offices located in the us that resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
interest expense interest expense decreased million in and increased million in  as compared with prior years 
the decrease in from was due to lower average debt outstanding and lower effective borrowing rates 
the increase in resulted from higher average debt outstanding associated with acquisition activity and treasury stock purchases

changes in the levels of non deductible goodwill associated with divestitures and in the levels of foreign earnings accounted for the changes in effective tax rates between periods 
the effective rate in is expected to decline to approximately  due to the elimination of goodwill amortization and the effects of tax planning strategies

segment revenues increased in and in excluding the impact of the may cis acquisition  north america s revenue increased in and in us credit information services revenue increased compared to growth in  with growth driven by a record credit reporting volume increase of 
the key industry growth drivers were mortgage  telecommunications  financial services and automotive 
lower interest rates helped generate record volumes in mortgage refinancing  cellular usage increased  and automakers zero rate financing incentives drove consolidated volumes with consecutive quarterly growth in in  volumes increased 
volume growth was partially offset by average unit price declines of in and in average pricing is impacted by mix of business  with many of our large customers driving increased volumes at lower average unit prices 
us credit information services compounded annual volume growth since is approximately 
in  we expect volume growth to return to levels more indicative of historical performance 
canadian revenue increased in on strong consumer credit volume growth compared to almost flat growth in during  increasing demand for information from mortgage industry customers  caused by a declining interest rate environment  resulted in growth in mortgage services revenue to million  compared with a decrease in in  we expect this business to decline from levels  as refinancing activity moderates 
our credit marketing services and direct marketing services businesses generated combined revenue of million  or growth  compared to million in excluding the direct marketing services incremental revenues of million from the may acquisition  revenues declined largely due to the economic impact of companies reducing advertising and marketing expenditures 
in credit marketing services  which includes pre screening  portfolio review  database and other marketing products  revenues declined versus a record year of growth 
lower revenues in were principally due to product mix shifts to lower priced risk management products  some price compression due to customer consolidation  and fewer marketing campaigns

financial condition cash provided by operations increased to million in  and free cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures increased to million 
the improvement over was largely influenced by higher operating income from core businesses  aggressive management of receivables days sales outstanding declined from days in to days in  and a million reduction in capital expenditures 
cash provided by operations in was million 
operating cash flow has been sufficient to fund capital expenditures  dividend payments and scheduled maturities of long term debt 
during  the company s cash used in investing activities totaled million compared to million in the company was less acquisitive in versus as its major focus was the spin off of certegy

the company continued its year history of paying dividends  which totaled million in dividends were million lower than as the company reduced its quarterly dividend after the certegy spin off from to per share 
at december   million was available to the company under its new million revolving credit facility 
should csc exercise its option to sell its credit reporting business to the company note  additional sources of financing would be required 
however  management believes the company has sufficiently broad access to the capital markets to enable it to arrange alternative sources of financing 
alternative sources of funding available would include the public debt markets and additional bank lines of credit 
inflation we do not believe that the rate of inflation has had a material effect on our operating results 
however  inflation could adversely affect our future operating results if it were to result in a substantial weakening in economic conditions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of complexity and warrant specific description 
valuation of long lived assets the company regularly evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of long lived assets principally goodwill  purchased data files  systems development and other deferred costs  and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries may be impaired or not recoverable 
the significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include changes in business strategy  market conditions  or the manner of use of an asset  underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results  and negative industry or economic trends 
in evaluating an asset for possible impairment  management estimates that asset s future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the asset is recoverable 
if it is determined that the asset is not recoverable  the company measures the impairment based on the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life 
while the company believes that its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect these evaluations 
in  the fasb issued statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which among other things  eliminates the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets and requires that goodwill be evaluated annually for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
the company adopted the standard effective january  for acquisitions prior to june   and  in accordance with the standard  will complete its first fair value based impairment tests by june  deferred tax assets the company estimates levels of future taxable income and utilizes prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in establishing and maintaining deferred tax assets see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
if the company is unable to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  the company s effective tax rate could increase 
certain factors affecting forward looking statements the management s discussion and analysis  and other portions of this form k  include forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements may include  among others  statements concerning the company s outlook for  volume and pricing trends  cost control measures and their results  effective income tax rates  the company s expectations as to funding its capital expenditures and operations  and other statements relative to future plans and strategies 
these statements are based on a number of assumptions that are inherently subject to significant uncertainties  many of which are beyond equifax s control 
important factors that either individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the following a change in the growth rate of the economies within which the company conducts business  particularly in the us  such that consumer spending and related consumer debt are impacted  a decline or change in the marketing techniques of credit card issuers  unexpected pricing pressures above and beyond the levels experienced in the past  us and international regulatory or legislative changes which may adversely affect the businesses conducted by the company  successful integration of acquisitions  risks associated with investments and operations in foreign countries  including regulatory environments  exchange rate fluctuations  and local political  social and economic factors  successful development and marketing of new products and services to existing and new industries  protection and validity of patent and other intellectual property rights  successful incorporation of technological change  control and reduction of cost and expense  interest rate fluctuations  changes in us and global financial and equity markets  including market disruptions and significant interest rate fluctuations  which may impede the company s access to  or increase the cost of  external financing  increased competitive pressures both domestically and internationally  and other risks or unforeseen factors including those described below 
we depend on our customers requirements for consumer credit information 
if these requirements decrease  our business might be adversely affected 
our core product is our consumer credit reports 
in general  the usage of credit reports and related services is driven by consumer demand for credit via new credit cards  automobile loans  home mortgages and refinancings and other consumer loans and lenders efforts to develop new  and monitor existing  credit relationships 
consumer demand for credit tends to increase during periods of economic expansion 
on the other hand  lenders efforts to monitor existing credit relationships tend to increase during periods of economic contraction 
consequently  revenue from consumer credit information products is influenced by cyclical economic trends related to consumer spending and debt 
we rely on demand for consumer information services 
our business might be negatively affected by a decline in demand 
we provide value added consumer information services including direct marketing products and services to our traditional customers  as well as to catalog  publishing  high tech  travel and manufacturing clients 
direct marketing products also include data capture  database management  and registration card programs for consumer durable goods manufacturers 
in the event that consumers begin to buy fewer of the types of products and services that have in the past been marketed and sold through direct marketing  or if direct marketing loses effectiveness in comparison to other methods of advertising  use of our direct marketing products and services could lessen and  consequently  our revenues and profits could decline 
we rely on external data sources 
loss of access to credit and other data from external sources could negatively impact our business 
we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and non proprietary databases  including data received from customers and various government and public record services 
the continued availability of such data sources cannot be assured 
although we have no reason to believe that access to current data sources will become restricted  loss of access to  or the availability of  data in the future due to government regulation or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in government regulation could increase our costs or otherwise affect our profits 
our business involves collection of consumer and business data and distribution of such information to businesses making credit and marketing decisions 
consequently  certain of our activities and services are subject to regulation under various federal laws  including the fair credit reporting act and the gramm leach bliley act  as well as similar state laws 
we are also subject to privacy and consumer credit laws and regulations in foreign countries where we do business 
we have no reason to believe that additional regulations will be imposed that will have a material adverse effect on our business 
however  further federal  state and local data use regulations may affect our operations with increased compliance requirements and potential loss of revenue or decrease in profits 
competition could hurt our business 
equifax operates in a number of geographic  product and service markets  which are highly competitive 
we primarily compete with two global consumer credit reporting companies  experian information solutions  inc and trans union llc  which offer credit reporting products that are similar to those we offer 
we also compete with these and other companies that offer marketing information products and services  including acxiom corporation and infousa  inc in each of our markets  we compete on the basis of responsiveness to customer needs as well as the quality and range of products and services offered 
although we believe that we offer a broader range of products and services in more geographic markets than our competitors  we face strong competition in certain geographic  product and service markets which  if successful  may have adverse effects on our operations 
the above factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward looking statements are illustrative and by no means exhaustive 
all forward looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
in the normal course of business  the balance sheets and results of operations of the company s foreign subsidiaries can be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s position is to not hedge translational foreign currency exchange risks 
however  the company does hedge material transactional foreign currency exchange risks  and at december   the exchange risks associated with the company s intercompany advances to its uk operations  as well as the intercompany balances associated with funding its italy acquisition were hedged by having a portion of the borrowings under its revolving credit facility denominated in those respective currencies 
the company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by maintaining an appropriate weighted average debt maturity and controlling the mix of fixed and variable rate debt  in part by using interest rate swap agreements 
the company s earnings can be affected by the impact that changes in interest rates have on its variable rate obligations 
at december   approximately million of the company s short term and long term debt was in variable rate facilities 
at this level  if market interest rates increased  interest expense would increase approximately million per year pre tax
