item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to the other information in this report  certain statements in the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a are forward looking statements 
when used in this report  the word expects  anticipates  estimates  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
such risks and uncertainties are set forth below under factors affecting future operating results 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we manufacture and market service verification equipment to pre qualify  verify  and diagnose telecommunications  cable  and internet networks 
we design our products to increase technicians effectiveness in the field and to provide realistic network simulations for equipment manufacturers to test their products 
our customers include incumbent local exchange carriers  competitive local exchange carriers  other service providers  and network infrastructure suppliers and installers throughout north america  latin america  europe  africa  the middle east  and the asia pacific region 
sources of net sales we sell our products predominantly to large telecommunications and cable tv service providers 
these prospective customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of our and our competitors products and require each vendor to expend substantial time  effort  and money educating the prospective customer about the value of the proposed solutions 
delays associated with potential customers internal approval and contracting procedures  procurement practices  and testing and acceptance processes are common and may cause potential sales to be delayed or foregone 
as a result of these and related factors  the sales cycle of new products for large customers typically ranges from six to twenty four months 
during the past year  we have observed a decline in capital spending in the telecommunications industry  which may lengthen the sales cycle further 
substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements or requirements contracts 
as a result  we commit resources to the development and production of products without having received advance or long term purchase commitments from customers 
historically  a significant portion of our net sales has resulted from a small number of relatively large orders from a limited number of customers 
in and  we sold million and million  respectively  of our products to affiliates of sbc communications  which represented and  respectively  of our net sales 
in  sales to sbc communications affiliates decreased from the prior year primarily due to a decrease in capital spending  a slow down in the deployment of services  and acceptable levels of dsl test equipment on hand 
as a percentage of sales  sales to sbc communications affiliates have also decreased due to our expanding customer base and the diversification of our business 
additionally  in and  million and million or and  respectively  of our sales were generated from our copper loop test head to lucent technologies or solectron  a contract manufacturer for lucent technologies 
solectron integrated this product into the stinger dslam that it manufactured for lucent technologies 
the initial order from lucent technologies for the cooper loop test head was completed during the second quarter of significant future orders of this copper loop test head product remains uncertain 
no customers comprised more than of our sales in we anticipate that our operating results for any given period will continue to be dependent to a significant extent on large purchase orders  which can be delayed or cancelled by our customers without penalty 
in addition  we anticipate that our operating results for a given period will continue to be dependent on a small number of customers 
currently  competition in the telecommunications and cable equipment market is intense and is characterized by declining prices due to increased competition and new products 
due to competition and potential pricing pressures from large customers in the future  we expect that the average selling price for our products will decline over time 
if we fail to reduce our production costs accordingly  our gross margins will correspondingly decline 
see factors affecting future operating results competition and risks of the telecommunications industry 
during the last three years  a substantial portion of our net sales have come from customers located outside of the united states  and we believe that growth may require expansion of our sales in international markets 
currently  we maintain a procurement support and manufacturing facility in taipei  taiwan  manufacturing  research  development  and sales facilities in modena  italy  and research  development  and sales facilities in anjou  canada 
we also have a representative liaison office in beijing  china  a foreign sales corporation in barbados  and sales offices in tokyo  japan and seoul  korea 
prior to our acquisition of pro 
tel 
srl pro 
tel in february  international sales were denominated solely in us dollars and  accordingly  we have not historically been exposed to fluctuations in non us currency exchange rates related to these sales activities 
since our acquisition of pro 
tel in february  and then avantron in january  we have had a small amount of sales denominated in euros and the canadian dollar and have at certain times used derivative financial instruments to hedge our foreign exchange risks 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments 
to date  foreign exchange exposure from sales has not been material to our operations 
we have also been exposed to fluctuations in non us currency exchange rates related to our procurement activities in taiwan 
in the future  we expect that a growing portion of international sales may be denominated in currencies other than us dollars  thereby exposing us to gains and losses on non us currency transactions 
we may choose to limit such exposure by using hedging strategies 
see factors affecting future operating results risks of international operations 
we recognize product sales at the time of shipment unless we have future obligations or customer acceptance is required  in which case revenue is recognized when these obligations have been met or the customer accepts the product 
we offer a three year warranty covering parts and labor on our wire line access including dsl products and fiber optic products sold in the united states and generally offer a one year warranty covering parts and labor for our products sold overseas  with a two year extended warranty option at time of sale 
our cable tv and signaling products are covered by a one year warranty 
revenue from sales of extended warranties is deferred and recognized over the extended warranty term  which is generally two years 
we charge estimated warranty costs to cost of sales when the related sales are recognized 
we recognize revenue for out of warranty repairs when we ship the repaired product 
cost of sales our cost of sales consist primarily of the following 
direct material costs of product components  manuals  product documentation  and product accessories  
production wages  taxes  and benefits  
production allocated overhead costs  
warranty costs  
the costs of board level assembly by third party contract manufacturers  and 
scrapped material used in the production process 
we recognize direct cost of sales  wages  taxes  benefits  and allocated overhead costs as we ship product 
we expense scrapped materials as incurred 
our industry is characterized by limited supply chains and long lead times for the materials and components that we use in the manufacture of our products 
if we underestimate our requirements  we may have inadequate inventory  resulting in additional product costs for expediting delivery of long lead time components 
an increase in the cost of components could result in lower margins 
additionally  these long lead times have in the past  and may in the future  cause us to purchase large quantities of some parts  increasing our investment in inventory and the risk of the parts obsolescence 
any subsequent write off of inventory could also result in lower margins 
see factors affecting future operating results dependence on sole and single source suppliers 
operating costs we classify our operating expenses into three general operational categories selling and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative 
our operating expenses include stock based compensation and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we classify charges to the selling and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expense categories based on the nature of the expenditures 
although each of these three categories includes expenses that are unique to the category type  there are commonly recurring expenditures that typically appear in all of these categories  such as salaries  amortization of stock based compensation  employee benefits  travel and entertainment costs  allocated communication costs  rent and facilities costs  and third party professional service fees 
the selling and marketing category of operating expenses also includes expenditures specific to the selling and marketing group  such as commissions  public relations and advertising  trade shows  and marketing materials 
we allocate the total cost of overhead and facilities to each of the functional areas that use overhead and facilities based upon the square footage of facilities used by each of these areas or the headcount in each of these areas 
these allocated charges include facility rent and utilities for the corporate office  communications charges  and depreciation expenses for our building and for office furniture and equipment 
in and  we recorded amortization of deferred stock based compensation expense of  and  respectively  related to the grant of pre ipo options to purchase our common stock at exercise prices subsequently determined to be below fair market value 
total compensation expense related to these options  which were granted in and the first quarter of  will be amortized on a straight line basis  over the four year vesting periods of the options  to the departments of the employees who received these below market option grants 
in and  we allocated amortization of deferred stock based compensation expense of  and  respectively  to cost of sales   and  respectively  to research and development expense   and  respectively  to selling and marketing expense and  and  respectively  to general and administrative expense 
also  we recorded amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets of  and  respectively  in general and administrative expense 
at december    of deferred stock based compensation remained to be amortized  at a rate not exceeding  per quarter 
acquisitions in july  we acquired hukk engineering hukk  a manufacturer of digital cable testing equipment 
we accounted for the hukk engineering acquisition using the purchase method and  accordingly  recorded goodwill and other intangibles of approximately million to be amortized on a straight line basis over the next five years until the end of at december   we had million including work force in place in unamortized goodwill remaining from the hukk acquisition 
we will periodically review this asset for impairment  as required by sfas no 
in addition  we recorded deferred stock based compensation for stock options granted to employees of hukk during  in the amount of million  to be amortized on a straight line basis over their four year vesting period and non compete amortization of million to be amortized on a straight line basis over the next two to five years  based on the expected life of the underlying assets 
in february  we acquired pro 
tel 
srl and subsidiaries pro 
tel  an italian manufacturer of distributed network signaling analysis equipment  its us affiliate  and the assets of an unrelated us distributor 
we accounted for this acquisition using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  recorded goodwill of million  to be amortized on a straight line basis over its original estimated useful life of two to five years  until the end of at december   we had million including work force in place in unamortized goodwill remaining from the pro 
tel 
acquisition 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we will no longer amortize this goodwill  which will be periodically reviewed for impairment 
in addition  we recorded deferred stock based compensation for stock options granted to employees of pro 
tel in the first quarter of in the amount of million  to be amortized on a straight line basis over their four year vesting periods and non compete agreements of million  to be amortized on a straight line basis over the next two to five years  based on the expected life of the underlying assets 
in january  we acquired avantron technologies  inc avantron  a canadian company that specializes in the design and manufacture of cable tv modem spectrum analyzers and performance monitoring systems 
the purchase price was million in cash and short term notes payable 
we accounted for this acquisition using the purchase method of accounting  and  accordingly  recorded goodwill of million  to be amortized on a straight line basis over its original estimated useful life of two to five years  until the end of in accordance with sfas no 
 we will no longer amortize goodwill resulting from the avantron acquisition 
at december   we had million including work force in place in unamortized goodwill remaining from the avantron acquisition 
we will periodically review this asset for impairment  as required by sfas no 
in february  we acquired the calan cable tv test business from agilent technologies  inc for approximately million in cash 
calan products incorporate digisweep technology  the industry s fastest  high resolution  digital services compatible sweep 
calan products are designed to support a complete range of remote and field maintenance activities  from forward and return path alignment  to signal measurement and ingress troubleshooting 
we believe that acquisitions and joint ventures may be an important part of our growth and competitive strategy 
factors affecting future operating results acquisitions 
salary reductions in response to a slowdown in our customers telecom spending patterns and softening demand for telecom equipment generally  we implemented a salary reduction throughout the company ranging from at the lowest paid employee level up to at the founder executive management level 
this reduction commenced during the second quarter of a salary freeze was also implemented along with this base salary reduction 
during the first quarter of  the company implemented additional reductions in workforce as well as additional salary adjustments 
these salary adjustments in the first quarter of were as high as 
the overall cost savings of the workforce reductions and salary adjustments will average a savings in payroll costs for the company 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and we have prepared our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations based upon these financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to apply accounting policies using estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
we consider critical those accounting policies that meet both of the following criteria they must require our most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  which often result from a need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and they must be among the most important of our accounting policies to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies include determination of our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  reserves for future costs of meeting obligations under our standard product warranty agreements  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and the valuation of our minority interest investment in another company 
we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable by making our best estimate considering our historical accounts receivable collection experience and the information that we have about the status of its accounts receivable balances 
if future conditions cause our collection experience to change or if we later obtain different information about the status of any or all of our accounts receivable  additional allowances for doubtful accounts receivable may be required 
we determine our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory by making our best estimate considering the current quantities of inventory on hand and our forecast of the need for this inventory to support future sales of our products 
we often have only limited information on which to base our forecasts  and if future sales differ from these forecasts  additional reserves for excess and obsolete inventory may be required 
we generally offer standard warranties on our products ranging from one to three years 
at the time we recognize a product s sale  we determine the reserve for the future cost of meeting our obligations under these warranties by considering our historical experience with warranty costs 
if the future costs of meeting these obligations differ from the historical experience  additional reserves for warranty obligations may be required 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and for the future tax consequences attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
if we obtain information that causes our forecast of future taxable income to change or if actual future taxable income differs from our forecast  we may have to revise the carrying value of our deferred tax assets  which would affect our net income in the period in which the change was made 
the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to carry forward or back operating losses and tax credits 
if changes in the tax laws occur that inhibit its ability to carry forward or back operating losses or tax credits  we will recognize the effect on our deferred tax assets in the results of operations of the period that includes the enactment date of the change 
furthermore  we measure our deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax laws expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if tax laws change  we will recognize the effect on its deferred tax assets and liabilities in the results of operations of the period that includes the enactment date of the change 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements also requires us to apply accounting policies related to revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when earned 
we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment  based on the assumption that collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
when the arrangement with the customer includes future obligations or is contingent on obtaining customer acceptance  we recognize revenue when those obligations have been met or customer acceptance has been received 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before income taxes income taxes net income comparison of years ended december  and net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to million in from million in sales of our wire line access products  including dsl products  accounted for million of the net sales decrease and sales of our signaling products accounted for million of the net sales decrease 
these decreases were offset by an increase of million in sales of our cable tv products and an increase of million in sales of our fiber optics products 
of the million cable tv products sales increase  million came from sales by our avantron subsidiary  which we acquired in  and million came from increased sales of our existing product lines 
sales in as compared to decreased million  or  in north america  increased million  or  in europe africa middle east  increased million  or  in asia pacific  and decreased million  or  in latin america 
the decrease in north american sales from to is due to lower sales of our wire line access products  including dsl  and lower sales of our protocol and fiber optics products 
our wire line access product sales decreased million in north america from to of this decrease  million was from reduced copper loop test head sales for lucent technologies stinger dslam product  which decreased from million in to million in significant future orders of the copper loop test head product remains uncertain 
north american sales of our protocol products decreased million and our fiber optics products decreased million from to the decreases in our north american sales were primarily the result of decreased capital spending by our telecommunications customers 
in addition  over the past year some dsl providers have encouraged customer self installation and have reported that up to of their customers perform self installation 
if the self installation procedure reduces the need for technicians to test for dsl service  demand for our dsl wire line access products may decline further as our equipment may be used primarily for troubleshooting rather than installation 
sales of our cable tv products increased by million in north america from to of this increase  million was the result of the avantron acquisition which occurred in the first quarter of and the remaining million came from our existing product lines 
international sales  including north american sales to canada  decreased to million  or of net sales  in from million  or of net sales  in the decrease in international sales is primarily due to decreased sales of our wire line access product lines  including dsl  which were partially offset by increased sales of our fiber optics products 
cost of sales 
cost of sales consists primarily of direct material  warranty  and personnel costs related to the manufacturing of our products and allocated overhead 
cost of sales decreased to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due to the decrease in net sales from to cost of sales were of net sales in versus of net sales in the increase as a percentage of net sales resulted primarily from an increased presence in our sales mix of cable tv products  lower margin wire line access products  and international sales  which tend to carry lower margins than north american sales because they often go through distributor networks 
we expect that cost of sales may continue to increase as a percentage of sales for the foreseeable future as our light chassis dsl products and cable tv products increase as a percentage of our overall product mix  if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of total sales  or if pricing pressures increase 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of the costs of payroll and benefits for engineers  equipment  and consulting services 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in this increase is primarily due to costs associated with increased staffing dedicated to research and development activities 
research and development expenses were of net sales in and of net sales in the increase as a percentage of net sales in is primarily due to decreased product sales while research and development expenditures increased  as we continue to invest in product development and expansion of our product lines 
research and development expenses may increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in product development and expand our product lines 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of the costs of payroll and benefits for selling and marketing personnel  manufacturers representatives and direct sales commissions  travel and facilities expenses related to selling and marketing  and trade show and advertising expenses 
selling and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in commissions expense 
commission expense decreased primarily due to the decrease in our sales  particularly north american sales  for which we make the preponderance of our commission payments 
selling and marketing expenses were of net sales in and of net sales in the increase as a percentage of net sales in is primarily due to decreased oem sales  which led to lower commission  occupancy  and salary and related expenses as a percentage of sales than in selling and marketing expenses may increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our selling and marketing capabilities 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and benefits  facilities  other costs of our finance and administrative departments  legal and accounting expenses  and amortization expenses for goodwill and other intangible assets related to our business acquisitions 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in general and administrative expenses were of net sales in and of net sales in the increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to increased amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets related to recent business acquisitions  amortization of deferred stock based compensation  and increased staffing and related costs associated with the growth of our business as a public company for the full year of general and administrative expenses may increase in absolute dollars to accommodate the growth of our business  to add related infrastructure  and to pursue our acquisition strategy 
other income  net 
other income  net represents primarily interest earned on cash and investment balances net of interest expense on notes payable and short term borrowings under our line of credit 
other income  net increased to million in from million in the increase in resulted primarily from increased interest earned on higher balances of cash and cash equivalents resulting from increased cash flow from operations  interest income earned for a full year in on the net proceeds received from our initial public offering in july  and income earned from a grant from the italian government 
income taxes 
income taxes consist of federal  state  and international income taxes 
we recorded income tax expense of million in and million in our effective income tax rates were in and in our income tax expense and effective income tax rate are lower in than in primarily due to lower levels of income 
comparison of years ended december  and net sales 
net sales increased approximately to million in from million in sales of our wire line access products  including dsl products  accounted for million of the net sales increase  our new fiber optics products accounted for million of the net sales increase  our new signaling products accounted for million of the net sales increase  and our cable tv products accounted for million of the net sales increase over the prior year 
sales in as compared to increased million  or  in north america  million  or  in europe  million  or  in asia and million  or  in latin america 
the strong increase in north american sales is primarily due to sales of our dsl and fiber optic products 
our dsl products accounted for million of the increase in north american sales for the year in part due to sales of our new customized copper loop test head for lucent technologies stinger dslam  which totaled million or of net sales for sales of our new fiber optics products accounted for million of the increase in north american sales for the year 
our new signaling products accounted for million of the increase in north american sales for the year  and sales of our cable tv products accounted for million of the increase in north american sales for the year 
international sales  including north american sales to canada  increased to million  or of net sales  in from million  or of net sales  in the increase in international sales is primarily due to increased sales of our dsl product line and our expanded international operations 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to million in from million in cost of sales represented of net sales in and of net sales in the increase as a percentage of net sales resulted primarily from a higher sales volume of light chassis dsl products  which have lower average selling prices than full chassis dsl products and the introduction of our new fiber optics and cable tv product lines which generated lower gross margins than the mix of products sold during the prior year 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in this increase is primarily due to costs associated with increased staffing dedicated to research and development activities 
research and development expenses represented of net sales during and of net sales in the decrease as a percentage of net sales in was primarily attributable to increased product sales relative to research and development expenditures 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in this increase is primarily due to increased staffing to support expanded product offerings and increased marketing and promotional activities 
selling and marketing expenses represented of net sales in and of net sales in the decrease as a percentage of net sales during was primarily due to increased oem sales  which have led to lower commission  occupancy  and salary and related expenses as a percentage of sales 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in general and administrative expenses represented of net sales in and in the increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales was primarily related to increased staffing and related costs associated with the growth of our business  amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets related to recent business acquisitions  and amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
other income  net 
in  we also recorded a million gain on a forward contract 
other income  net increased to million in from million in the increase in resulted primarily from increased interest earned on higher balances of cash and cash equivalents resulting from increased cash flow from operations  a gain on a forward contract  and interest income earned on the net proceeds received from our initial public offering in july income taxes 
we recorded income tax expense of million in and million in our effective income tax rates were in and in the effective income tax rate is higher in than in primarily due to higher levels of income  charges from non cash amortization of goodwill and deferred stock based compensation  and an increased concentration of sales in local jurisdictions with higher tax rates 
backlog our backlog of customer orders at december  was approximately million compared to approximately million at december  variations in the size and delivery schedules of purchase orders that we receive  as well as changes in customers delivery requirements may result in substantial fluctuations in the amount of backlog orders for our products from quarter to quarter 
seasonality our sales have been seasonal in nature and tied to the buying patterns of our customers 
prior to  the largest quarterly sales had usually been during the last calendar quarter of the year  as customers spent the unused portions of their annual budgets 
in and  there was a change in this fourth quarter seasonality with no significant remaining unused budget dollars available for an increase in the fourth quarter seasonal sales 
prior to  the first quarter of any given year had historically been a light period of orders due to the delayed release mid first quarter of the current year s budget 
we expect that our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and will be difficult to predict given the nature of our business 
many factors could cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter in the future  including the lengthy and unpredictable buying patterns of our customers  the degree to which our customers allocate and spend their yearly budgets  and the timing of our customers budget processes 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our operations and satisfied our capital expenditure requirements primarily through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our line of credit 
additionally  in july of  we received net proceeds totaling million from our initial public offering 
as of december  and  we had working capital of million and million  respectively  and cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
as of december  and  we also had million and million  respectively  in investments in marketable securities 
cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in  and million in operating cash flows increased during as compared to primarily as a result of net collections of accounts receivable and a net reduction in inventory purchases 
also  the amount of non cash charges against net income increased significantly in from this was primarily the result of increased goodwill amortization from the acquisition of avantron technologies  inc in the first quarter of and increased depreciation resulting from the completion of our new corporate headquarters building in san jose  ca  also in the first quarter of therefore  the decline in the net income from to was not associated with a proportional decline in operating cash flow 
the factors increasing operating cash flow were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and income taxes payable 
cash used in investing activities was million in  million in  and million in in  cash used in investing activities included million for acquisitions  million for purchases of marketable securities  and million for capital expenditures 
this was offset by million generated from the sale of marketable securities 
cash used for capital expenditures increased during over primarily due to the completion of our new facility in san jose  california 
cash outlays for the facility during were million for the land and million for construction 
cash used for capital expenditures during also included research and development laboratory equipment  general office equipment to support the new facility  and demonstration equipment to support our selling and marketing programs 
in  cash used in investing activities included million for acquisitions  million for purchases of marketable securities  million for capital expenditures  and million for the purchase of a long term investment 
cash provided by financing activities was million in and million in  and cash used in financing activities was million in in  cash provided by financing activities was net proceeds of million from common stock issued pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan  million from notes payable  and million from stock options exercised 
this was offset by million repurchase common stock  million to repay notes payable  and million to repay short term borrowings 
in  cash provided by financing activities was primarily net proceeds of million from our initial public offering in july  net proceeds of million received from stock issued pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan  and million received from the exercise of stock options 
these were partially offset by million used for repayments of notes payable 
currently  we have a line of credit from bank of america  na for up to million in borrowings at the bank s prime rate less at december  
the line of credit expires on august  at december  and  there were no balances outstanding under the line of credit 
borrowings under the line of credit are secured by our inventory and accounts receivable 
the agreement governing the line of credit contains covenants  with which we were in compliance at december  and  that  among other things 
require us to maintain various financial covenants  including profitability and current ratios  
limit capital expenditures  
restrict the payment of dividends on our common stock to dividends payable in common stock and to million payable in any one fiscal year  and 
restrict our ability to redeem our common stock beyond of our net income for the prior fiscal year 
we also have credit facilities from various italian financial institutions with limits ranging from million up to million  which bear interest at variable rates ranging from to at december   based on the abi prime rate 
at december   had been drawn down under these facilities 
the remaining borrowings consist of a loan from the italian government  which bears interest at a year 
at december   the outstanding balance on this loan was million 
interest payments are to be paid starting in and principal payments in we believe that the net proceeds received by us from our initial public offering  together with current cash balances  cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  and other activities for at least the next months 
after that  if current sources are not sufficient to meet our needs  we may seek additional equity or debt financing 
in addition  any material acquisition of complementary businesses  products or technologies  or material joint ventures could require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
we cannot assure you that such additional financing would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
factors affecting future operating results quarterly fluctuations because our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future  our stock price may decline and may be volatile 
in the past  we have experienced significant fluctuations in our quarterly results due to a number of factors beyond our control 
in the future  our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and may be difficult to predict given the nature of our business 
many factors could cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter in the future  including the following 
the size and timing of orders from our customers  which may be exacerbated by the increased length and unpredictability of our customers buying patterns  and our ability to ship these orders on a timely basis  
the degree to which our customers have allocated and spent their yearly budgets  
the uneven pace of technological innovation  the development of products responding to these technological innovations by us and our competitors  and customer acceptance of these products and innovations  
the varied degree of price  product  technology competition  and our customers and competitors responses to these changes  
the relative percentages of our products sold domestically and internationally  
the mix of the products we sell and the varied margins associated with these products  and 
the timing of our customers budget processes 
the factors listed above may affect our business and stock price in several ways 
given the high fixed costs related to overhead  research and development  and advertising and marketing  among others  if our net sales are below our expectations in any quarter  we may not be able to adjust spending accordingly 
as a result of the above  our stock price may decline and may be volatile  particularly if public market analysts and investors perceive these factors to exist  whether or not that perception is accurate 
furthermore  the above factors  taken together may make it more difficult for us to issue additional equity in the future or raise debt financing to fund future acquisitions and accelerate growth 
these risks may be exacerbated by  or may be in addition to  the risk of a general economic slowdown that affects the economy as a whole or the telecommunications industry in particular 
dependence on dsl the majority of our sales have been from our dsl products 
demand for our dsl products has recently declined and may decline further 
in fiscal and  sales of our dsl and other wire line access products represented approximately and of our net sales  respectively 
currently  our dsl products are primarily used by a limited number of incumbent local exchange carriers  including the regional bell operating companies  and competitive local exchange carriers who offer dsl services 
a competitive local exchange carrier is a company that  following the telecommunications act of  is authorized to compete in a local communications services market 
these parties  and other internet service providers and users  are continuously evaluating alternative high speed data access technologies  including cable modems  fiber optics  wireless technology  and satellite technologies  and may at any time adopt these competing technologies 
these competing technologies may ultimately prove to be superior to dsl services and reduce or eliminate the demand for our dsl products 
in addition  the availability and quality of dsl service may be impaired by technical limitations and problems of the existing copper wire network on which dsl service runs  such as 
the distance of end users from the central office of the incumbent local exchange carrier  which is typically limited to between  and  feet  
the quality and degree of interference within the copper wire network  
the configuration of the copper wire network  which may degrade or prevent dsl service  
the ability of dsl networks and operational support systems of service providers to connect and manage a substantial number of online end users at high speeds  while achieving reliable and high quality service  and 
the vulnerability of the copper wire network to physical damage from natural disasters and other unanticipated telecommunications failures and problems 
during  the business prospects of many competitive local exchange carriers declined significantly 
some competitive local exchange carriers filed for bankruptcy or went out of business 
due to these and other factors  we have seen a decline in dsl deployment and a significant decline in demand for our dsl products 
if dsl deployment rates continue to decrease or remain flat  demand for our dsl products may decline further 
it is not possible to predict whether any decline would be temporary or sustained 
accordingly  our future success is partially dependent upon whether dsl technology continues to gain growing and widespread market acceptance by exchange carriers  end users of their services  and other internet service providers and users 
in the past  our customers have deployed dsl equipment  including our products  in substantially larger volumes than their subscriber count 
over the past year to eighteen months  some of our customers have leveled or decreased the rate at which they deploy dsl equipment 
this decrease has lead to a decrease in demand for our products 
in addition  the inability of our current or future customers to acquire and to retain subscribers as planned  or to respond to competition for their services or reduced demand for their services  could cause them to further reduce or to eliminate entirely their dsl deployment plans 
risks of the telecommunications industry we face several risks regarding the telecommunications industry  including the possible effects of its unpredictable growth or decline  the possible effects of consolidation among our principal customers  and the risk that deregulation will slow 
since the passage of the telecommunications act of  the telecommunications industry has experienced rapid growth 
the growth has led to great innovations in technology  intense competition  short product life cycles  and  to some extent  regulatory uncertainty inside and outside the united states 
the course of the development of the telecommunications industry is  however  difficult to predict 
companies operating in this industry have a difficult time forecasting future trends and developments and forecasting customer acceptance of competing technologies 
one possible effect of this uncertainty is that there is  and may continue to be  a delay or a reduction in these companies investment in their business and purchase of related equipment  such as our products  and a reduction in their and our access to capital 
in addition  deregulation may result in a delay or a reduction in the procurement cycle because of the general uncertainty involved with the transition period of businesses 
the growth that has occurred since the passage of the telecommunications act of has slowed  and it is unknown whether or when it will resume 
this slowdown includes reduced investment in the telecommunications industry in general and delayed purchase orders for service verification equipment such as our products in particular 
it is not possible to predict whether this slowdown will be temporary  or sustained 
in addition  the telecommunications industry has been experiencing consolidation among its primary participants  such as incumbent local exchange carriers and competitive local exchange carriers  several of whom are our primary customers 
for example  in recent years  gte merged with bell atlantic to create verizon communications  inc  both of which were customers of ours 
continued consolidation may cause delay or cancellation of orders for our products 
the consolidation of our customers will likely provide them with greater negotiating leverage with us and may lead them to pressure us to lower the prices of our products 
if deregulation in international markets or in the united states were to slow or to take an unanticipated course  the telecommunications industry might suffer  among other effects  the following 
a continued general slowdown in economic activity relating to the telecommunications industry and a consequent multiplier effect on the general economy  
continued reduced investment in the telecommunications industry in general  and in dsl technology in particular  due to increased uncertainty regarding the future of the industry and this technology  
greater consolidation of providers of high speed access technologies  which may not favor the development of dsl technology and which might provide these companies with greater negotiating leverage regarding the prices and other terms of the dsl products and services they purchase  
uncertainty regarding judicial and administrative proceedings  which may affect the pace at which investment and deregulation continue to occur  and 
continued delay in purchase orders of service verification equipment  such as our products  if customers were to reduce their investment in new high speed access technologies 
customer concentration a limited number of customers account for a high percentage of our net sales  and any adverse factor affecting these customers or our relationship with these customers could cause our net sales to decrease 
our customer base is concentrated  and a relatively small number of companies have accounted for a large percentage of our net sales 
net sales from our top five customers in the united states represented approximately in  in  and in our largest customers over this period have been affiliates of sbc communications inc  which include pacific bell telephone company  southwestern bell telephone company  ameritech corporation  nevada bell  advanced solutions  inc  and southern new england telephone and which in total accounted for less than of net sales in fiscal  and approximately in fiscal additionally  sales to both lucent technologies and solectron  a contract manufacturer for lucent technologies stinger dslam products  represented approximately of sales in and in as of the end of the second quarter of  our initial contract orders from lucent technologies for the copper loop test head came to a negotiated completion 
in general  our customers are not obligated to purchase a specific amount of products or to provide us with binding forecasts of purchases for any period 
as a result of the general slowdown in the united states economy  our net sales declined significantly in and we anticipate that future sales may continue to decline from our fiscal net sales 
our future sales to lucent technologies and solectron may be immaterial 
sales of our dsl related equipment  in particular  have declined and may continue to decline further in compared to the loss of a major customer or the reduction  delay  or cancellation of orders from one or more of our significant customers could cause our net sales and  therefore  profits to decline 
in addition  many of our customers are able to exert substantial negotiating leverage over us 
as a result  they may cause us to lower our prices and to negotiate other terms and provisions that may negatively affect our business and profits 
use of field technicians if service providers reduce their use of field technicians and continue successful implementation of a self service installation model  demand for our products could decrease 
to ensure quality service  our major service provider customers have historically sent a technician  who uses our products  into the field to verify service for installations 
sbc communications  qwest communications  bell south corporation  and verizon communications each encourage their customers to install dsl themselves 
over the past year  some dsl providers have reported that up to of their customers perform self installation 
additionally  at t has begun a self installation program for cable modem devices 
by encouraging customers to install dsl and cable access themselves  these companies intend to reduce their expenses and expedite installation for their customers 
to encourage self installation  these companies offer financial incentives 
if service providers continue successful implementation of these plans or choose to send technicians into the field only after a problem has been reported  or if alternative methods of verification become available  such as remote verification  the need for field technicians and the need for our products would decrease 
product development if we are unable to enhance our existing products and to manage successfully the development of new products  our future success may be threatened 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological advances  changes in customer requirements and preferences  evolving industry and customer specific protocol standards  and frequent new product enhancements and introductions 
our existing products and our products currently under development could be rendered obsolete by the introduction of products involving competing technologies  by the evolution of alternative technologies or new industry protocol standards  or by rival products by our competitors 
these market conditions are more complex and challenging because of the introduction of the high degree to which the telecommunications industry is fragmented 
we believe our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability  on a timely and cost effective basis  to continue to do the following 
anticipate and respond to varied and rapidly changing customer preferences and requirements  a process made more challenging by our customers buying patterns  
anticipate and develop new products and solutions for networks based on emerging technologies  such as the asynchronous transfer mode protocol that packs digital information into cells to be routed across a network  and internet telephony  which comprises voice  video  image  and data across the internet  that are likely to be characterized by continuing technological developments  evolving industry standards  and changing customer requirements  
invest in research and development to enhance our existing products and to introduce new verification and diagnostic products for the telecommunications  internet  cable network  and other markets  and 
support our products by investing in effective advertising  marketing  and customer support 
we cannot ensure that we will accomplish these objectives  and our failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on our market share  business and financial results 
sales implementation cycles the length and unpredictability of the sales and implementation cycles for our products makes it difficult to forecast revenues 
sales of our products often entail an extended decision making process on the part of prospective customers 
we frequently experience delays following initial contact with a prospective customer and expend substantial funds and management effort pursuing these sales 
our ability to forecast the timing and amount of specific sales is therefore limited 
as a result  the uneven buying patterns of our customers may cause fluctuations in our operating results  which could cause our stock price to decline 
other sources of delays that lead to long sales cycles  or even a sales loss  include current and potential customers internal budgeting procedures  internal approval and contracting procedures  procurement practices  and testing and acceptance processes 
recently  our customers budgeting procedures have lengthened 
the sales cycle for larger deployment now typically ranges from six to twenty four months and up to six or more months 
the deferral or loss of one or more significant sales could significantly affect operating results in a particular quarter  especially if there are significant selling and marketing expenses associated with the deferred or lost sales 
electrical blackouts in california possible shutdowns in our manufacturing operations could occur 
beginning in and continuing into  california experienced restricted supplies of electrical power 
these restricted supplies resulted in blackouts and higher electricity costs 
since we do not have back up generators  should we experience blackouts  our business will be negatively affected by slowed production  slowed research and development  slowed marketing  slowed sales efforts  and a general loss of productivity 
in addition  increased electrical rates will increase our costs and lower our margins 
managing growth and slowdowns we may have difficulty managing our expansions and contractions in operations  which could reduce our chances of maintaining our profitability 
we experienced rapid growth in revenues and in our business in and followed by a significant slowdown in that has placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on our management and operations 
for example  our revenues increased from million in from million in yet revenues have slowed to million in  and our number of employees has increased to at december  from at december  to date  we have acquired four significant companies or lines of business  hukk engineering in july  pro 
tel 
srl and subsidiaries in february  avantron technologies  inc in january  and the calan cable tv test business from agilent technologies  inc in february as a result of our historical growth and future growth  or slowdowns  we face several risks  including the following 
the need to improve our operational  financial  management  informational  and control systems  
the need to hire  train  and retain highly skilled personnel in a market in which there may be severe shortages of these kinds of personnel  as we discuss below  
the possibility that our management s attention will be diverted from running our business to the needs of managing a public company  and 
the challenge to manage expense reductions as rapidly as revenue slowdowns without impacting development strategies 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to manage growth or slowdowns profitably 
acquisitions we have acquired three significant companies  one business line  and intend to pursue further acquisitions in the future 
these activities involve numerous risks  including the use of cash  amortization of goodwill  and the diversion of management attention 
as discussed in the previous section  we have acquired four significant companies or lines of business to date  hukk engineering  pro 
tel 
srl  and avantron technologies  inc  and the calan cable tv test business line from agilent technologies  inc as a result of these and other smaller acquisitions  we face numerous risks  including the following 
integrating the existing management  sales force  technicians  and other personnel into one culture and business  
integrating manufacturing  administrative  and management information and other control systems into our existing systems  
developing and implementing an integrated business strategy over what had previously been three independent companies  and 
developing compatible or complementary products and technologies from previously independent operations 
the risks stated above will be made more difficult because hukk engineering is located in norcross  georgia  avantron is located in anjou  canada  and pro 
tel is located in modena  italy 
in addition  if we make future acquisitions  these risks will be exacerbated by the need to integrate additional operations at a time when we may not have fully integrated all of our previous acquisitions 
if we pursue further acquisitions  we will face similar risks as those above and additional risks  including the following 
the diversion of our management s attention and the expense of identifying and pursuing suitable acquisition candidates  whether or not consummated  
negotiating and closing these transactions  
the potential need to fund these acquisitions by dilutive issuances of equity securities and by incurring debt  and 
the potential negative effect on our financial statements from the increase in goodwill and other intangibles  the write off of research and development costs  and the high cost and expenses of completing acquisitions 
we cannot ensure that we will locate suitable acquisition candidates or that  if we do  we will be able to acquire them and then integrate them successfully and efficiently into our business 
competition competition could reduce our market share and decrease our net sales 
the market for our products is fragmented and intensely competitive  both inside and outside the united states  and is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  regulatory developments  and varied and changing customer preferences and requirements 
we compete with a number of united states and international suppliers that vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services offered 
the following table sets forth our principal competitors in each of our product categories 
product category principal competitors wire line access acterna corporation  agilent technologies  inc fiber optics sonet sdh digital lightwave  inc  acterna corporation  agilent technologies  inc 
cable tv acterna corporation  agilent technologies  inc signaling inet technologies  inc  gn nettest many of these competitors have longer operating histories  larger installed customer bases  longer relationships with customers  wider name recognition and product offerings  and greater financial  technical  marketing  customer service  and other resources than we have 
we expect that  as our industry and markets evolve  new competitors or alliances among competitors with existing and new technologies may emerge and acquire significant market share 
we anticipate that competition in our markets will increase  and we will face greater threats to our market share  price pressure on our products  and the likelihood that  over time  our profitability may decrease 
over the past year  we have recorded lower revenue and gross margins 
in addition  it is difficult to assess accurately the market share of our products or of sunrise overall because of the high degree of fragmentation in the market for dsl service verification equipment  in particular  and for high speed data access technology  in general 
as a result  it may be difficult for us to forecast accurately trends in the markets  which of our products will be the most competitive over the longer term  and therefore  what is the best use of our human and other forms of capital 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to compete effectively 
dependence on key employees if one or more of our senior managers were to leave  we could experience difficulties in replacing them and our operating results could suffer 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of a relatively small number of key senior management  technical  sales  and marketing personnel 
in particular  the loss of either of two of our founders  paul ker chin chang and paul a 
marshall  would likely harm our business 
neither of these individuals is bound by an employment agreement with us  and we do not carry key man life insurance on them 
in addition  competition for senior level personnel with telecommunications knowledge and experience is intense 
if any of our senior managers were to leave sunrise  we would need to devote substantial resources and management attention to replace them 
as a result  management attention may be diverted from managing our business  and we may need to pay higher compensation to replace these employees 
dependence on sole and single source suppliers because we depend on a limited number of suppliers and some sole and single source suppliers that are not contractually bound in the long term  our future supply of parts is uncertain 
we purchase many key products  such as microprocessors  field programmable gate arrays  bus interface chips  optical components  and oscillators  from a single source or sole suppliers  and we license certain software from third parties 
we rely exclusively on third party subcontractors to manufacture some sub assemblies  and we have retained  from time to time  third party design services in the development of our products 
we do not have long term supply agreements with these vendors 
in general  we make advance purchases of some products and components to ensure an adequate supply  particularly for products that require lead times of up to nine months to manufacture 
in the past  we have experienced supply problems as a result of financial or operational difficulties of our suppliers  shortages  and discontinuations resulting from component obsolescence or other shortages or allocations by suppliers 
our reliance on these third parties involves a number of risks  including the following 
the unavailability of critical products and components on a timely basis  on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  
the unavailability of products or software licenses  resulting in the need to qualify new or alternative products or develop or license new software for our use and or to reconfigure our products and manufacturing process  each of which could be lengthy and expensive  
the likelihood that  if these products are not available  we would suffer an interruption in the manufacture and shipment of our products until the products or alternatives become available  
reduced control over product quality and cost  risks that are exacerbated by the need to respond  at times  to unanticipated changes and increases in customer orders  and 
the unavailability of  or interruption in  access to some process technologies 
in addition  the purchase of these components on a sole source basis subjects us to risks of price increases and potential quality assurance problems 
this dependence magnifies the risk that we may not be able to ship our products on a timely basis to satisfy customers orders 
we cannot ensure that one or more of these factors will not cause delays or reductions in product shipments or increases in product costs  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks of international operations our plan to expand sales in international markets could lead to higher operating expenses and may subject us to unpredictable regulatory and political systems 
sales to customers located outside of the united states represented of our net sales in  in  and in  and we expect international revenues to continue to account for a significant percentage of net sales for the foreseeable future 
in addition  an important part of our strategy calls for further expansion into international markets 
as a result  we will face various risks relating to our international operations  including the following 
potentially higher operating expenses  resulting from the establishment of international offices  the hiring of additional personnel  and the localization and marketing of products for particular countries technologies  
the need to establish relationships with government owned or subsidized telecommunications providers and with additional distributors  
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the risks of using hedging strategies to minimize our exposure to these fluctuations  which have been heightened by our acquisition of pro 
tel and avantron  whose revenues have been and are likely to continue to be in euros and canadian dollars  respectively  and 
potentially adverse tax consequences related to acquisitions and operations  including the ability to claim goodwill deductions and a foreign tax credit against us federal income taxes  especially since italy has a higher tax rate 
we cannot ensure that one or more of these factors will not materially and adversely affect our ability to expand into international markets or our revenues and profits 
in addition  the asia pacific and latin america regions have experienced instability in many of its economies and significant devaluations in local currencies 
of our sales in  of our sales in  and of our sales in were derived from customers located in these regions 
these instabilities may continue or worsen  which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations 
if international revenues are not adequate to offset the additional expense of expanding international operations  our future growth and profitability could suffer 
concentration of control our executive officers and directors retain significant control over us  which allows them to decide the outcome of matters submitted to stockholders for approval 
this influence may not be beneficial to all stockholders 
as of december   paul ker chin chang  paul a 
marshall  and robert c 
pfeiffer beneficially owned   and  respectively  of our outstanding shares of common stock 
consequently  these three individuals  acting together  are able to control the election of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions that must be submitted to a vote of stockholders 
in addition  mr 
chang  mr 
marshall  and mr 
pfeiffer constitute three of the six members of the board of directors and have significant influence in directing the actions taken by the directors 
the interests of these persons may conflict with the interests of other stockholders  and the actions they take or approve may be contrary to those desired by other stockholders 
this concentration of ownership and control of the management and affairs of our company may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company that other stockholders may consider desirable 
potential product liability our products are complex  and our failure to detect errors and defects may subject us to costly repairs and product returns under warranty and product liability litigation 
our products are complex and may contain undetected defects or errors when first introduced or as enhancements are released 
these errors may occur despite our testing and may not be discovered until after a product has been shipped and used by our customers 
many of the products that we ship contain known imperfections that we consider to be insignificant at the time of shipment 
we may misjudge the seriousness of a product imperfection and allow it to be shipped to our customers 
these risks are compounded by the fact that we offer many products  with multiple hardware and software modifications  which makes it more difficult to ensure high standards of quality control in our manufacturing process 
the existence of these errors or defects could result in costly repairs and or returns of products under warranty and  more generally  in delayed market acceptance of the product or damage to our reputation and business 
in addition  the terms of our customer agreements and purchase orders  which provide us with protection against unwarranted claims of product defect and error  may not protect us adequately from unwarranted claims against us  unfair verdicts if a claim were to go to trial  settlement of these kinds of claims  or future regulation or laws regarding our products 
our defense against these claims in the future  regardless of their merit  could result in substantial expense to us  diversion of management time and attention  and damage to our business reputation and our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers 
need for highly trained personnel we may not be able to retain for certain positions the r d  manufacturing  sales  and marketing personnel we need to support our business 
our business requires engineers  technicians  and other highly trained and experienced personnel 
in particular  because our products require a sophisticated selling effort targeted at several key people within our prospective customers organizations  we have a special need for experienced sales personnel 
in addition  the complexity of our products and the difficulty of configuring and maintaining them require certain highly trained customer service and support personnel 
although competition for such persons has decreased recently  it remains strong  especially in the san francisco bay area 
therefore  we may not be successful in retaining these individuals 
our failure to keep these kinds of employees could impair our ability to grow or maintain profitability 
reliance on non us workers if non us immigration policies prevent us from hiring or retaining the workers we need  our growth may be limited 
in the past  we have filled a significant portion of our new personnel needs  particularly for our engineers  with non us citizens holding temporary work visas that allow these people to work in the united states for a limited period of time 
we rely on these non us workers because of the shortage of engineers  technicians  and other highly skilled and experienced workers in the telecommunications industry in the united states  in general  and in the san francisco bay area  in particular 
regulations of the immigration and naturalization service permit non us workers a limited number of extensions for their visas and also set quotas regarding the number of non us workers us companies may hire 
as a result  we face the risk that a portion of our existing employees may not be able to continue to work for us  thereby disrupting our operations  and that we may not be able to hire the number of engineers  technicians  and other highly skilled and experienced workers that we need to grow our business 
furthermore  changes in these regulations and local workforce availability could exacerbate these risks 
intellectual property risks policing any unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties and defending any intellectual property infringement claims against us could be expensive and disrupt our business 
our intellectual property and proprietary technology is an important part of our business  and we depend on the development and use of various forms of intellectual property and proprietary technology 
as a result  we are subject to several related risks  including the risks of unauthorized use of our intellectual property and the costs of protecting our intellectual property 
much of our intellectual property and proprietary technology is not protected by patents 
if unauthorized persons were to copy  obtain  or otherwise misappropriate our intellectual property or proprietary technology without our approval  the value of our investment in research and development would decline  our reputation and brand could be diminished  and we would likely suffer a decline in revenue 
we believe these risks  which are present in any business in which intellectual property and proprietary technology play an important role  are exacerbated by the difficulty in finding unauthorized use of intellectual property in our business  the increasing incidence of patent infringement in our industry in general  and the difficulty of enforcing intellectual property rights in some foreign countries 
in addition  litigation has in the past been  and may in the future be  necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights 
this kind of litigation is time consuming and expensive to prosecute or resolve  and results in substantial diversion of management resources 
we cannot ensure that we will be successful in that litigation  that our intellectual property rights will be held valid and enforceable in any litigation or that we will otherwise be able to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology 
anti takeover provisions anti takeover provisions in our charter documents could prevent or delay a change of control and  as a result  negatively impact our stockholders 
some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of discouraging  delaying  or preventing a change in control of our company or unsolicited acquisition proposals that you  as a stockholder  may consider favorable 
these provisions provide for 
authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock  
a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  
prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  
requiring super majority voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and by laws  
limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  
prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  and 
establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholders meetings 
some provisions of delaware law and our stock incentive plans may also have the effect of discouraging  delaying  or preventing a change in control of our company or unsolicited acquisition proposals 
these provisions also could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we sell our products in north america  asia  latin america  africa  the middle east  and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
prior to our acquisition of pro 
tel 
srl pro 
tel in february  international sales were denominated solely in us dollars and  accordingly  we had not historically been exposed to fluctuations in non us currency exchange rates related to these sales activities 
since our acquisitions of pro 
tel in february and avantron in january  we now have a small amount of sales denominated in euros and canadian dollars  and we have at certain times used derivative financial instruments to hedge our foreign exchange risks 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments 
to date  foreign exchange risks from these sales have not been material to our operations 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our investments 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and in high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market  and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
due to the nature of our investments  we anticipate no material market risk exposure
