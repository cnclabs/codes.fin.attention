acquisitions in on february   we acquired gwns from viacom  inc and certain of its subsidiaries 
on august   we acquired from cinram us holdings  inc the interest in cinram pop that we did not already own 
on september   we acquired the remaining interest in livewire network services  also referred to as lns that we did not already own  thereby acquiring the operations of ascent network services 

table of contents earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization we believe that earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  is an important measure of our financial performance 
ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  excluding gains and losses on asset sales and unusual charges such as restructuring  integration and impairment 
our investments in new infrastructure  machine capacity  technology and goodwill arising from our significant acquisition activity have produced a relatively high depreciation and amortization expense and have historically been a significant annual non cash charge to earnings 
ebitda is calculated before depreciation and amortization charges and  in businesses with significant non cash expenses  is widely used as a measure of cash flow available to pay interest and repay debt  and  to the extent available after debt service and other required uses  to make acquisitions or invest in capital equipment and new technologies 
as a result  we view ebitda as an important measure of our financial performance and valuation and intend to report ebitda as a measure of financial performance 
ebitda does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
ebitda does not reflect that portion of our capital expenditures that may be required to maintain our market share  revenues and leadership position in our industry 
moreover  not all ebitda will be available to pay interest or repay debt 
additionally  our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
critical accounting policies valuation of goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets  and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance to historical or projected future operating results  substantial changes in strategy or the manner of use of our assets  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill  other intangible assets  and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon undiscounted cash flows  we measure the impairment by obtaining market place comparables or by calculating a projected discounted cash flow analysis using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risks involved 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding impairment 
on january   statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result  we will cease to amortize our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets of million 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in fiscal year and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we expect to complete our initial review during the first quarter of fiscal year see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our assessment of adopting sfas no 
valuation of trade receivables 
we must make estimates of the collectability of our trade receivables 
our management analyzes the collectability based on historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon specifically identified receivables that we believe are uncollectible 
in addition  we also record an amount based upon a percentage of each aged category of our trade receivables 
these percentages are estimated based upon our historical experience of bad debts 
our trade receivables balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million  as of december  results of operations the pictures group s revenues are primarily generated from fees for audio and video post production  audio and video special effects and editorial services for the television  film and advertising industries 
the media group provides owners of film libraries a broad range of restoration  preservation  archiving  professional mastering and duplication services 
the networks group s revenues consist of fees relating to facilities and services necessary to assemble and distribute programming for cable and broadcast networks across the world via fiber  satellite and the internet 
the network group s results also include our bandwidth management initiative  a new and developing business 
corporate related items and unallocated revenues and expenses are reflected in corporate and other  below 
additionally  corporate and other includes the results of our interactive media business  a new and developing business initiative 
cost and expenses include costs of services which consist primarily of production wages  facility costs and other direct costs  selling  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  interest expense and income taxes 

table of contents our consolidated results of operations for the year ended december   include the results of gwns from february  cinram pop from august and lns from september  their respective dates of acquisition 
our operations prior to the acquisition and merger in june are referred to as the operations of todd ao 
the year ended december  represents the operations of todd ao prior to the todd merger for the five months ended may  and our consolidated operations for the seven months ended december  our consolidated operations for the seven months ended december  include the results of soundelux and triumph from july  soho from august  visiontext from october and vsc from december periods prior to calendar year represent only the operations of todd ao 
for the purpose of the table and discussion below  our operating results for the seven months ended december  have been combined with the operating results of todd ao for the five months ended may  the combined year ended december   and the resulting annual operating results are compared to the operating results of todd ao for the year ended august  the operating results are not comparable between the annual periods as the five months ended may  and the year ended august  do not include the effects of purchase accounting adjustments related to the todd merger  and the subsequent period representing the seven months ended december  does include the effects of the purchase accounting adjustments related to the todd merger

the overall increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenues for the pictures group as a result of the impact of a recessionary market environment and a reduction in television advertising spending 

table of contents costs of services increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the combined year ended december  the contribution of mc combined with the acquisitions of lns  gwns  cinram pop  visiontext  vsc  soundelux  triumph and soho contributed million  or  of the overall increase 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the combined year ended december  the contribution of mc combined with the acquisitions of lns  gwns  cinram pop  visiontext  vsc  soundelux  triumph and soho contributed million  or  of the overall increase 
the remainder of the increase was primarily due to corporate centralization activities and increases in professional and legal fees 
as a result of the above  ebitda  as defined  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the combined year ended december  depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the combined year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the equipment  goodwill and other intangibles acquired with respect to the acquisitions previously mentioned and new capital additions incurred during the year ended december  non cash compensation expense was million for the year ended december   as compared to million in income reported for the combined year ended december   an increase of million 
the income recorded during the combined year ended december  was related to a decline in value of the underlying financial instruments used to value employee stock appreciation rights or sars 
the expense in the year ended december  related primarily to the increase in value of the underlying financial instruments used to value employee sars in addition to the issuance of in the money stock options pursuant to our incentive compensation plan 
for a description of our sars and option plans  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the combined year ended december  the increase is attributable to additional borrowings under the senior credit agreement  the liberty subordinated credit agreement and other borrowings incurred primarily related to the funding of acquisitions 
interest expense for fiscal year included non cash expense related to payments under the liberty subordinated credit agreement totaling million  million related to interest rate swaps  and million of amortization of debt discount and debt issuance cost 
interest expense for the combined year ended december  included  of non cash expense related to payments under the liberty subordinated credit agreement 
for a discussion on interest rate swaps  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
included in operating expenses for the year ended december  is million in impairment charges relating to long lived assets  goodwill and intangibles  which is more fully explained in the impairment charge section below 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of fiscal we completed certain restructuring activities intended to improve operating efficiencies and effectiveness to strengthen our competitive position in the marketplace through cost and expense reductions 
in connection with this initiative  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million 
this charge includes payments million related to lease charges due to planned facility closures and  for employee severance payments 
other expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from  for the combined year ended december  the increase was primarily due to losses on the disposal of assets totaling million and charges related to the decline in market value of certain freestanding interest rate swap instruments totaling million  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these expenses were partially offset by other income 
as a result of the above  the loss before income taxes and change in accounting principle increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the combined year ended december  
table of contents the provision for income taxes increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the combined year ended december  the increase is due to valuation allowances recorded on deferred tax assets during the year ended december  our fiscal year effective income tax rate was approximately primarily due to disallowed deductions for goodwill of million and valuation allowances of million 
as a result  our net loss increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the combined year ended december  comparison of pro forma results unaudited for the year ended december  to the pro forma results for the year ended december  unaudited 
as a result of the significance and timing of the contribution of mc and the acquisitions of lns  gwns  cinram pop  visiontext  vsc  soundelux  triumph and soho in and  certain information for the years ending december  and is being presented on a pro forma basis 
our management believes that these pro forma revenue and ebitda results provide additional information useful in analyzing the underlying business results 
however  pro forma operating results should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  actual results of operations 
the following unaudited pro forma financial information is presented as if each acquisition was consummated on january  year year ended december  ended december  segment revenues in thousands pictures group media group networks group corporate and other year year ended december  ended december  segment ebitda in thousands pictures group media group networks group corporate and other net loss pro forma revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in pictures group revenue as a result of reduced television advertising spending 
additionally  the networks group experienced a million  or  decrease in revenue attributed to the timing of certain large projects 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million  or  in media group revenue resulting from the expansion of business 
pro forma ebitda decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of a million decrease in the pictures group s ebitda due to the revenue shortfall as described above offset by cost savings 
such reductions were partially offset by a million  or increase in media group ebitda and a million  or  increase in networks group ebitda  both as a result of significant reductions in their cost structures resulting from integration and reorganization activities 
additionally  ebitda decreased by million due to additional costs associated with our new interactive media business initiative and by million due to 
table of contents increases in other expenses  primarily associated with corporate centralization activities and increased professional and legal fees 
this combined increase in costs of million  as presented above  flowed through corporate and other 
pro forma net loss increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the combined year ended december  the increase in net loss was primarily driven by the impairment charge and higher depreciation and amortization  interest  non cash compensation and other expenses 
impairment charge during fiscal year  challenging economic conditions impacted overall business trends 
in particular  both the entertainment and technology sectors suffered a substantial decline in economic activity 
these challenges were further exacerbated by the events of september   resulting in a continued negative economic impact 
these factors contributed largely to our inability to meet our financial and operating objectives and have resulted in reduced expectations and opportunities for the near term 
accordingly  we evaluated the recoverability of our goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets carrying values pursuant to accounting principles board apb no 
 intangible assets  and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this involved writing down goodwill  intangibles and certain long lived assets to their fair value  which was based upon both fair market comparables and by discounting the future cash flows of these assets through their remaining useful lives 
as these definite lived intangible assets and long lived assets will remain in service  the remaining net book value of the assets will be depreciated over their remaining estimated useful lives 
therefore  during the quarter ended december   we recorded asset impairment charges totaling million 
these charges primarily represent a write off of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets of our existing feature film and entertainment television sound services  and certain assets associated with the development of our fiber optic transport and ip hosting transport services 
part of our original valuation of these assets was affected by our expectation that the development and delivery of interactive television and other interactive services  including the rollout of a broadband infrastructure  would have materialized sooner and therefore would have provided more immediate growth opportunities 
additionally  during the fourth quarter we completed certain integration and consolidation activities intended to improve operating efficiencies and effectiveness and to strengthen our competitive position in the marketplace through cost and expense reductions 
in connection with these initiatives  we recorded a charge of million for impairment of certain equipment and other fixed assets

non cash compensation income of million was recognized for the combined year ended december  driven by a net decline in the underlying stock price of certain sars 
such sars relate to the conversion of mc stock options to shares of liberty media group class a common stock in connection with liberty media s acquisition of mc on april  interest expense increased million  or  to million for the combined year ended december   from million for the year ended august  the increase was primarily due to increased borrowings attributable to the acquisitions and indebtedness assumed and or refinanced in connection with the acquisitions of visiontext  soundelux  triumph and soho 
other expense decreased  or  to  for the combined year ended december  from  for the year ended august  as a result of the above  income before taxes and net change in accounting principle decreased million from million in income for the year ended august  to an million loss before taxes and change in accounting principle net for the combined year ended december  the provision for income taxes increased million to million for the combined year ended december  from  for the year ended august  our effective income tax rate for the period was approximately primarily due to permanent differences of million arising from disallowed tax deductions for goodwill 
income before change in accounting principle net decreased million from million income for the year ended august  to an million loss before change in accounting principle net for the combined year ended december  in the fiscal year ended august  we elected early adoption of statements of position no 
 reporting on the costs of start up activities  and reported the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net  as described in apb opinion no 
 in the amount of  net of income tax benefit in the amount of  as a result of the election described above  net income after a net change in accounting principle decreased million from net income of million for the year ended august  to a net loss of million for the combined year ended december  liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operations for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the combined year ended december  the increase in net cash provided by operations for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to increased ebitda related to acquisitions offset by increased cash paid for interest on additional borrowings 

table of contents during the year ended december   we invested million in property  plant and equipment  as compared to million for the combined year ended december  these expenditures reflected continued investments in the pictures  media and networks groups as well as our shared corporate infrastructure 
the decrease from the prior combined year ended december  was primarily due to lower spending in the pictures group  partially offset by increases in the media and networks groups and in corporate investments 
we anticipate that capital expenditures in fiscal year will be funded from our operating cash flows 
we made investments during the year ended december  to acquire gwns for million  lns for million and cinram pop for  for a description of our acquisitions  see part i  item  business change of control and subsequent acquisitions and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
while there are no definitive acquisition agreements pending as of december   we continuously seek opportunities to partner with or acquire companies that  when integrated with our current operations  could enable us to provide new or enhanced services to our customers 
during the year ended december   investing activities also included the sale of certain marketable equity securities and property  plant and equipment which generated proceeds of million 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was million compared to million for the combined year ended december  the cash provided by financing activities was primarily used for acquisitions as well as for general working capital requirements 
for a description of our borrowings  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended december   we borrowed an additional million under various agreements with creditors including our senior credit agreement as well as various capital lease obligations and real property mortgages 
in addition  during fiscal year we borrowed million under our liberty subordinated credit agreement 
borrowings from liberty media were used primarily to partially fund the acquisition of gwns and to fully fund the acquisition of lns 
during fiscal year  we repaid million of debt that matured during the year mostly related to capital leases and mortgage notes 
these repayments were funded by cash generated from operations as well as proceeds from the senior credit agreement and the liberty subordinated credit agreement 
at december   million and million were outstanding under the senior credit agreement and the liberty subordinated credit agreement respectively  and million was available for future borrowings 
in accordance with terms of the senior credit agreement as amended march   new lenders may be added to the agreement  with the consent of the current lenders  potentially increasing the available borrowings by an additional million for a total commitment of million 
as of december   borrowings related to real property mortgages totaled million  capital lease obligations totaled million  and other notes payable totaled million 
as of december   million was available for future borrowings under two real property mortgage notes 
proceeds from these notes are restricted in use to funding capital expenditure initiatives for our united kingdom operations 
as of december   borrowings under the senior credit agreement have an effective interest rate ranging from to and maturities in fiscal years through our mortgage notes  which are floating  have effective interest rates of to as of december   and maturities in fiscal years through capital leases  which are fixed and floating  have effective interest rates ranging from to  and maturities in fiscal years through if not earlier converted  the convertible subordinated notes issued to liberty media under the liberty subordinated credit agreement will become due and payable on june  interest on the convertible subordinated notes accrues at a rate of per annum  payable quarterly either in cash  shares of our class b common stock or a combination thereof  at our discretion  subject to certain limits 
to the extent interest is paid in shares of our class b common stock  such shares will be valued at of the ten day trailing average closing price of shares of our class a common stock on the interest payment date 
we believe that the cash flow from operations  combined with cash on hand  other liquid assets and borrowing capacity  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures through the next twelve months 
however  our operating cash flow  capital expenditures and access to future borrowings can be impacted by overall economic conditions outside of our control 
should significant economic declines occur that impact the business sectors we serve  our ability to expand our business would be 
table of contents impacted 
in addition  our borrowing costs can be impacted by changes in libor and other variable based interest rates which were at historically low levels as of december  new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the fasb also issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in august sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under the purchase method 
sfas no 
supersedes apb opinion no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 accounting for pre acquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises  and is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the new rules  we are no longer required to amortize goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  but will be subject to periodic testing for impairment 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
and subsequently  sfas no 
see below after its adoption 
sfas no 
supersedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
effective january   we will adopt sfas no 
and are evaluating the effect that such adoption may have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
as of the date of adoption of sfas no 
 we expect to have unamortized goodwill in the amount of approximately million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of million  all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas no 
amortization expense related to goodwill was approximately million for the year ended december   and million for the seven months ended december  any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
effective january   we estimate that we will record million in transitional impairment losses as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or disposal of long term assets  including discontinued operations 
sfas no 
superseded sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective in fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted  and in general are to be applied prospectively 
we plan to adopt sfas no 
effective january  and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
factors that may affect future results of operations factors that may affect future results of operations include  but are not limited to  industry wide market factors such as the timing of  and spending on  feature film and television programming production  foreign and domestic television advertising  and foreign and domestic spending by broadcasters  cable companies and syndicators on first run and existing content libraries  and the possibility of an industry wide strike or other job action by or affecting the writers guild  screen actors guild or other major entertainment industry union 
in addition  our failure to maintain relationships with key customers and certain key personnel  more rapid than expected technological obsolescence  and failure to integrate acquired operations in expected time frames could also cause actual results to differ materially from those described in forward looking statements 
in connection with several of our recent acquisitions  we have incurred significant indebtedness to fund the transactions 
this indebtedness may result in a significant percentage of our cash flow being applied to the payment of interest  and there can be no assurance that our operations will generate sufficient cash flow to service the indebtedness 
this indebtedness  as well as any indebtedness we may incur in the future  may adversely affect our ability to finance operations  as financial covenant limitations reach their maximum which could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities that may be in our best interests and that of our stockholders 

table of contents as part of our business strategy  we have acquired substantial operations in several different geographic locations over the last two years 
these businesses have experienced varying profitability or losses in recent periods 
since the aforementioned dates of acquisition  we have continued to work extensively on the integration of these businesses 
however  there can be no assurances regarding the ultimate success of our integration efforts or regarding our ability to maintain or improve the results of operations of these businesses 
for additional risk factors  see part i  item of this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risks we seek to reduce cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates by entering into financial arrangements intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility 
we continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged 
we assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities 
interest rate swap agreements are the primary instruments used to manage interest rate fluctuation affecting our million of variable rate debt primarily associated with our senior credit agreement 
at december   we had three outstanding interest rate swap agreements with a combined fair market value of million in favor of our counterparties 
in one swap agreement  we receive variable interest rate payments and make fixed interest rate payments on a notional amount of million 
the two remaining swap agreements have a combined notional amount of million  in which we receive fixed and pay variable interest rate payments 
as a result of the offsetting swap positions  the company is no longer hedging its risks associated with variable rate debt 
all three swap agreements mature on june  for further information regarding our borrowings and financial instruments  see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency risk we continually monitor our economic exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates and may enter into foreign exchange agreements where and when appropriate 
whenever possible  we utilize local currency borrowings to fund foreign acquisitions 
at december   we did not have any foreign exchange agreements 
substantially all of our foreign transactions are denominated in foreign currencies  including the liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries 
although our foreign transactions are not generally subject to significant foreign exchange transaction gains or losses  the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into united states dollars as part of our consolidated financial reporting 
as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates affect our financial position and results of operations 
until the current year  the british pound and the singapore dollar have been stable relative to the united states dollar 
however  during the year ended december   the british pound lost approximately  and the singapore dollar lost approximately  of their respective values relative to the us dollar
