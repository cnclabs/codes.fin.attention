item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview pharmanetics  inc  through its wholly owned subsidiary cardiovascular diagnostics  inc cvdi  develops  manufactures and markets rapid turnaround diagnostics to assess blood clot formation and dissolution 
cvdi s products are a proprietary analyzer and dry chemistry tests  known as the thrombolytic assessment system or tas that provide  at the point of patient care  rapid and accurate evaluation of hemostasis 
cvdi is also establishing itself in the emerging field of theranostics  or rapid near patient testing  in which the diagnostic results may influence treatment decisions 
current tests and tests under development are used in the treatment of angina  heart attack  stroke  deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary and arterial emboli 
the tas technology is used at the point of patient care which provides many potential benefits  including faster results for better treatment of patients  reduced usage of blood products for bleeding complications  quicker patient transfers from costly critical care settings and reduced hospital costs due to less paperwork and personnel time in processing blood samples 
the company currently derives income from the following sources tas product sales  interest income  and development income recognized in connection with collaboration agreements 
currently  product sales mainly consist of the company s routine test cards  the pt  aptt and hmt tests along with the related controls and analyzers 
upon introduction of these products in and  the company distributed these routine products through a direct sales force 
however  given a consolidating hospital industry  cvdi determined that distribution arrangements  rather than a direct sales force  were needed to penetrate the market 
thus  cvdi has signed a global distribution agreement with bayer diagnostics to distribute its products 
bayer s strength is in critical care areas of the hospital which the company believes should facilitate the placement of the tas technology 
in addition  the company s business strategy has evolved towards becoming more focused on theranostics  the development of specialty tests for drugs  some with narrow ranges between over and under dosage 
rapid diagnostic capabilities might improve patient care and turnover  and there is a market trend to obtain diagnostic information faster in order to effect therapy sooner 
the company believes that physicians are beginning to see the need for drug management tools and  consequently  the company is seeking greater involvement of physician thought leaders during development of new test cards 
the company also believes that these trends should allow the company to obtain higher pricing of these specialty tests 
as a result  the company has exhibited the flexibility of the tas platform and the potential to expand its menu of specialty tests by signing development agreements with major pharmaceutical companies to monitor the effects of certain new drugs that are in clinical trials or currently being marketed 
increased placement of specialty tests might also further demand for analyzers and routine anticoagulant tests 
the company believes it is well positioned in its development efforts to expand its menu of tests to monitor developmental drugs where rapid therapeutic intervention is needed

liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million and working capital of million  as compared to million and million  respectively  at december  during  the company used cash in operating activities of million 
the use of cash was principally due to funding the net operating loss of the company and increased inventories to support expected product sale increases 
the operating uses of cash were partially offset by funding provided through the collaboration with aventis that was recorded as deferred revenue 
net cash provided by investing activities was  in the net cash provided resulted mainly from maturities of short term investments offset by expenditures for new equipment and leasehold improvements related to the company s relocation to new facilities 
the company expects capital expenditures in to be much lower than in and to range from  to  cash provided by financing activities was million in as compared to million in this increase principally resulted from the issuance of common stock to bayer in april when bayer purchased  shares of common stock of the company at per share for million 
this investment increased bayer s ownership percentage in the company from approximately to

 the company has transferred to temporary equity an amount equal to the change in control payment called for by the purchase agreement 
under the new accounting guidelines  this temporary transfer is required only for those reporting periods in which the price per share paid by bayer is in excess of the fair market value of a common share  as measured by reference to the nasdaq national market 
the company has sustained continuing operating losses in and had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  the company expects to incur operating losses until product revenues reach a sufficient level to support ongoing operations 
in addition  in the year ended december   the company had negative cash flows from operations of approximately million 
in addition to the capital expenditures noted above  the company expects to incur additional operating losses during the company s working capital requirements will depend on many factors  primarily the volume of subsequent orders of tas products from distributors  primarily bayer  and from sales of specialty test cards such as the enoxaparin test 
in addition  the company expects to incur costs associated with clinical trials for new test cards 
the company might acquire other products  technologies or businesses that complement the company s existing and planned products  although the company currently has no understanding  commitment or agreement with respect to any such acquisitions 
in addition  the company might consider a joint venture or the sale of manufacturing rights to complete the commercialization of its routine anticoagulant monitoring tests 
management believes that its existing capital resources and cash flows from operations  including that from its distribution agreement with bayer  will be adequate to satisfy its planned liquidity and cash requirements through if additional liquidity becomes necessary in the future  the company will consider external sources of financing as needed 
these financings may take the form of equity financings such as a private placement of common or preferred stock  a follow on public offering of common stock or additional equity infusions from collaborative partners 
given the company s low amount of debt at december   the company would also consider debt financings such as a working capital line of credit 
contractual obligations the company has contractual obligations under notes payable  capital and operating lease agreements for years subsequent to future payments as of december  are as follows year ending december  notes capital operating payable leases leases total thereafter   total payments     recent accounting pronouncements in  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

sfas nos 
and change the accounting for business combinations and goodwill in two significant ways 
first  sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  second  sfas no 
changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
thus  amortization of goodwill  including goodwill recorded in past business transactions  will cease upon adoption of sfas no 
which will be january  these standards have not had any material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  and in july the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
fas requires that obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets be recorded as a liability when those obligations are incurred  with the amount of the liability initially measured at fair value 
fas will be effective for financial statements beginning after june   though early adoption is encouraged 
the application of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
fas supersedes fas  amends accounting principles board opinion no 
apb reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions and applies to all long lived assets  including discontinued operations 
fas requires that long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book or fair value less costs to sell 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and its provisions are generally expected to be applied prospectively 
the company does not expect the application of this statement to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
factors that might affect future results a number of uncertainties exist that might affect the company s future operating results and stock price 
there can be no assurance that new tests  particularly specialty tests  can be developed  receive regulatory approval  and be commercialized and accepted in the market 
other risks include market acceptance of tas  the company s continuing losses and the resulting potential need for additional capital in the future  managed care and continuing market consolidation  which may result in price pressure  particularly on routine tests  competition within the diagnostic testing industry and fda regulations and other regulatory guidelines affecting the company and or its collaborators 
the market price of the common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in the company s quarterly operating results as well as other factors which may be unrelated to the company s performance 
the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of and announcements concerning public companies 
such broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
securities of issuers having relatively limited capitalization are particularly susceptible to volatility based on short term trading strategies of certain investors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to variety of risks including market risk associated with interest rate movements 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to any investments the company may hold at various times and also related to its small amount of long term debt 
when investing  the company s purchases consist of highly liquid investments with maturities at the date of purchase between three and twelve months  thus  due to the short term nature of such investments and the company s usual intention to hold these investments until maturity  the impact of interest rate changes would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
in addition  the company has a small amount of long term debt obligations at a fixed interest rate 
given the fixed rate nature of this debt  the impact of interest rate changes also would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations
