item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands of dollars general fiscal year was a very difficult year for us 
revenue in quarter one began the year with the lowest revenue we have experienced in nine quarters at  that was over a drop in revenue from quarter one of fiscal during the second quarter of we implemented a cost reduction plan to better match our cost structure with our anticipated revenues 
this plan continues into fiscal it is important to note that our variable costs are approximately to of our revenue  which makes us extremely volume or revenue dependent 
the cost reduction plan has lowered our quarterly breakeven point from  at the beginning of fiscal to  at the end of the fiscal year 
we have continued to manage our costs and have a goal to lower the quarterly breakeven point to  by the end of fiscal our commitment to research and development continued in fiscal and we have and will continue this effort to maintain and increase our propriety technology and manufacturing process 
with revenue being our biggest issue in fiscal we have streamlined and improved our sales and marketing efforts with renewed focus and talent 
we are experiencing positive results from this effort and will continue to concentrate on this during fiscal to not only increase our sales  but to increase our diversification of revenue 
workforce reductions the events of september  and the continued sluggish economy in all of our markets during the first fiscal quarter of resulted in our reporting the lowest revenue in nine quarters 
in order to size our cost structure with anticipated revenue we reduced our employee base by persons at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year even though our revenue continued to increase in the third quarter  we continued our efforts to reduce cost by eliminating an additional employees 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  sales declined and an additional positions were eliminated 
in we eliminated a total of positions direct labor  manufacturing  engineering and administrative positions 
the amount of savings from workforce reductions are tied to the timing within a quarter and the amount of associated severance cost 
annualized wages and salaries for the positions that were eliminated are  cost savings for the year ended august  are summarized as follows year ended august  in thousands direct labor manufacturing selling  general and administrative research and development the company has paid an aggregate of related to severance through august  substantially all of the severance charges were paid in the same period the charges were recorded 
we have continued staff reductions during the first and second quarter of fiscal a total of positions have been eliminated in fiscal direct labor  manufacturing  engineering  and administrative positions 
annualized wages and salaries for the positions that were eliminated are  
table of contents in the aggregate  the company has eliminated positions through december  with annualized costs savings of approximately million direct labor  manufacturing  administrative positions  and engineering 
these reductions are expected to positively impact operating costs as compared to prior year quarterly amounts and in the aggregate for the year ended august  as compared to fiscal as follows quarter ended quarter ended quarter ended quarter ended year end november  march  may  august  august  in thousands direct labor manufacturing selling  general and administrative research development total we will attempt to reduce and contain cost as revenues fluctuate 
at the same time we seek to balance our ongoing development of new products and maintain our ability to react quickly to favorable market demands and opportunities 
in addition  these costs savings will not be realized in their entirety if increased production demand requires the hiring of additional personnel 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to the financial statements 
we believe that the following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
revenue recognition  sales returns and warranty the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition provides guidance on the application of gaap to selected revenue recognition issues  and our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with sab we recognize revenue upon shipment of product to our customers when all contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
in fiscal  we began a consignment program with a significant customer  where revenue is recognized when the customer uses the inventory 
our sales terms to our customers provide no right of return outside of contractual warranty claims 
sales and payment terms and pricing extended to our customers are governed by the respective contract agreements  together with binding purchase orders for each transaction 
payment terms are days for consignment program sales and to for other customers 
we record provisions against net sales for estimated product returns 
these estimates are based on factors that include  but are not limited to  historical sales returns  analyses of credit memo activities  current economic trends and changes in our customers demand 
we also record estimated provisions for warranty claims based on historical trends and known warranty claims 
should our actual product returns exceed our estimated allowances  additional reductions to our revenue would result 
as of august  and we had an aggregate amount of and  respectively  in our warranty and product return reserves 

table of contents allowance for uncollectible accounts we estimate the collectibility of our trade receivables and notes receivable which requires considerable amount of judgment in assessing the realization of these receivables including the current credit worthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
in order to assess the collectibility of these receivables  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
through these evaluations  we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to a deterioration of its financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
significant increases in reserves have been recorded in recent periods and may occur in the future due to evolving market conditions 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers  and if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of our receivables could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if we provide more allowances than we need  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on changes in estimate from our actual collection experience 
as of august  and we had and  respectively  in our accounts receivable allowance 
inventories we record our inventories at the lower of cost or market value 
generally all inventory purchases are for customized parts for a specific customer program 
as such  contractual arrangements are typically agreed too with the customer in order to protect the company in cases were the demand decreases  as often times the parts cannot be consumed in other programs 
even though contractual arrangements maybe in place we are still required to assess the utilization of our inventory 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels and contractual inventory holding requirements 
our reserve requirements generally increase as our projected demand requirements decrease due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes as well as longer than previously expected usage periods 
we have experienced significant changes in required reserves in recent periods due primarily to declining market conditions 
it is possible that significant changes in required inventory reserves may continue to occur in the future if there is a further decline in market conditions 
as of august  and we had and  respectively  reserved for our excess and obsolete inventory 
valuation of deferred taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for incomes taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction where we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as the depreciable life of fixed assets for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe recovery is unlikely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase the valuation allowance in a given period  we must increase tax expense within our statement of operations 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million at august  to write off all of our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize certain state and foreign tax credits and loss carryforwards 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction and the period over which our deferred tax assets are recoverable 

table of contents results of operations percentage of net sales for fiscal years ended august  net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative research  development and engineering other sales our net sales for the fiscal year ended august  decreased  or  compared to fiscal year the current year decrease in net sales from is largely a result of the general economic slowdown and the resulting impact in the hearing  communications  rfid access and electronic contract manufacturing markets 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of the internal manufacturing capacity of one of our customers increased  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
we began fiscal year with net sales of  in the first quarter  a nine quarter low  resulting primarily from the world wide economic recession and the impact of september  we experienced quarterly increases in revenue of  and respectively in the second and third quarters and a decrease of in the fourth quarter 
sales in fiscal increased  or  as compared to fiscal this increase in sales occurred in the first half of fiscal  primarily a result of increases in sales from the mexico division  which increased by approximately  to  increases in sales from the high density interconnect division  which increased by approximately  to  and increases in sales from the microelectronic division  which increased by approximately  we continue to experience fluctuations in demand for our hearing products and expect this to continue into the first half of fiscal the communications and rfid markets remain soft as our customers are awaiting market acceptance of new products and increased demand for existing products 
as the demand for these products increases  we are positioned for an increase in sales in these markets 
in addition  we are experiencing continued interest in our proprietary products which have received design approval for numerous applications with increasing low volume production 
we continue to work on new designs  qualification testing and continue to receive prototype orders from numerous customers 
at august   our backlog of orders for revenue in fiscal was approximately  compared to approximately  and  at august  and respectively 
we expect to ship our backlog as of august  during fiscal this decrease in backlog is mainly due to two factors  first  net sales are down overall from the weak economic conditions in our markets and secondly  from customers being reluctant to issue long term purchase orders based on lack of visibility for future demand and fluctuations in over all market conditions 
the company s backlog at december  was because our sales are generally tied to the customers projected sales and production of the related product  our sales levels are subject to fluctuations beyond our control 
to the extent that sales to any one customer represent a significant portion of our sales  any change in the sales levels to that customer can have a significant impact on the our total sales 
in addition  production for one customer may conclude while production for a new customer has not yet begun or is not yet at full volume 
these factors may result in significant fluctuations in sales from quarter to quarter 
sales to hearing medical customers for fiscal decreased by  or compared to fiscal this decrease in demand comparing fiscal to is a result of the general economic slowdown impacting the hearing contract manufacturing markets 
also  during the latter part of fiscal one of our customer s internal manufacturing capabilities increased  negatively impacting revenue by approximately  in the fourth quarter fiscal in fiscal we expect the impact from this customer will be a further reduction in annual net sales by  we have received increased orders from customers in the 
table of contents medical markets and we expect this trend to continue in fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into a program with siemens in which our finished goods inventory is held at siemens and we recognize revenue when they use the product 
in connection with this program  certain raw materials used by us for siemens products are being consigned to us by siemens 
the result of this program is that our finished goods inventory has increased  while raw materials for these programs have decreased 
we are anticipating a slight increase in net sales to the hearing medical customers for fiscal verses fiscal sales increased by  or compared to fiscal this increase is mainly the result of increased demand for hearing products from two of our main customers 
the closure of our mexico division late in fiscal resulted in decreased sales of  for fiscal as compared to fiscal and decreased  compared to fiscal none of the product manufactured in mexico was transferred to our other facilities 
sales to the rfid products market decreased  or in fiscal  as compared to fiscal rfid sales decreased in fiscal by  or as compared to fiscal this decrease comparing fiscal to is primarily due to a significant drop in revenue from one major customer 
this significant customer sold one division and terminated operations of another division during the first quarter of fiscal we have designed  developed and are producing new products and expanded our capabilities to improve revenue  however  the actual level of market acceptance is currently unknown 
sales to the communications and industrial non mexico products market decreased  or in fiscal  as compared to fiscal sales increased in fiscal of or as compared to fiscal this decrease comparing fiscal to is largely a result of the current weakness in the telecommunications markets 
we are experiencing increased activity in this market with numerous low volume purchase orders 
in september we realigned our sales emphasis to narrowly focus our efforts to key niche customers to obtain the best margin revenue while improving the efficiencies in developing new business 
gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of sales was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal while our gross margin percentages are heavily impacted by revenue  due to the fixed nature of many of our manufacturing costs  we were able to improve gross margins in fiscal from fiscal despite a decrease in net sales 
this improvement is due to reduction of direct labor and manufacturing employees in fiscal resulting in a savings of in direct labor and in administrative salary costs  improved manufacturing yields from in fiscal to in  reduced scrap expense from in fiscal to in  calculated as a percentage of gross sales and from the closure of the mexico division  which generated negative gross margins of during fiscal in future periods  we expect gross margins to be impacted in a similar manner as revenues increase and decrease 
in addition  when  and if  market acceptance of our proprietary broadband communications products occurs  we expect gross margins to increase  as these products are expected to have higher gross margin than we have historically experienced 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to start up costs in the prior year for the high density interconnect division  which were offset by higher operating losses for the mexico division  which was closed in the third quarter of fiscal operating expenses operating expenses in total were of net sales in fiscal  compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
operating expenses in decreased  when compared to fiscal fiscal also reflected an increase of  when compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by when compared to fiscal mainly due to the closure of the mexico operations and our constant attention to other cost containment measures  including reduction of employees  travel and other operational costs 
these reductions were offset by increases in professional fees and insurance costs totaling the reduction of employees during fiscal  resulted in decreased selling  general and administrative expenses of during fiscal these overall decreasing expenses are a result of our 
table of contents continued efforts to size our cost structure to revenue while balancing our commitment to maintain our research and development efforts and continued sales and marketing focus 
comparing fiscal to selling  general and administrative costs  decreased by in fiscal  which is a result of higher costs in fiscal from implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system and start up costs related to the high density interconnect division 
during the same period research  development and engineering costs increased by  or  due to increase emphasis on new product development  especially in the broadband communications market 
we expect that our operating expenses will further decrease by approximately  in fiscal as the result of fiscal and the first half of fiscal work force reductions 
research  development  and engineering expenses increased in fiscal  when compared to fiscal and increased when compared to fiscal year these increases are a result of our commitment to maintain our design capabilities to support future programs and continue the development and enhancement of our proprietary products and manufacturing processes 
comparing fiscal to costs increased in fiscal by  or  compared to fiscal the increase is a result of an emphasis on new product development  especially in the broadband communications market  as well as new process and product development in all focus markets the unusual charges of  incurred in fiscal year relates to the write off of accounts receivable related to customers of the mexico division and the closure of that division 
other income expense  net other expense of in fiscal is less than our other expenses in fiscal which reflects an increase of when compared to fiscal net interest expense for fiscal decreased by from fiscal as a result of the lower average debt in fiscal of approximately  and higher average cash balances of approximately  along with average interest rates of approximately lower during the current year period compared to the prior year period 
the lower average debt and higher average cash balances are the result of the net offering proceeds of  received in august other expense  net for fiscal of includes a non cash charge of net of tax related to costs associated with the abandoned colorado medtech transaction 
comparing fiscal to other expense in fiscal of increased as compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher interest expense  as a result of decreased average cash balances and increased short and long term debt throughout fiscal  partially offset by interest on loans receivable 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we wrote off our equity investment in micro substrates corporation msc 
including this write off  expenses incurred related to msc for fiscal were  income tax expense benefit management performs an analysis of the realization of the deferred tax asset each fiscal quarter 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that a valuation allowance of  should be established for all of our deferred tax assets due to the softness in our markets  the results of operations for the fourth quarter  and uncertainties about visibility to customer order rates  and a general economic recovery 
for fiscal we recognized tax expense of  compared to a tax benefit of and in fiscal and respectively 
comparing fiscal to the primary difference in the tax expense between the periods is the establishment of a  deferred tax allowance of which  was included in income tax expense 
an aggregate of of tax valuation allowance was reflected as an adjustment to additional paid in capital as it represents the tax asset benefit from stock option exercises that are included in our net operating loss carryforwards 
management will monitor this deferred tax asset going forward 
at the end of fiscal  we had net operating loss carryforwards expiring at various dates ranging from through even though this valuation allowance has been established  we still retain all the economic benefits of the net operating loss in future years 
comparing fiscal to  the income tax benefit of in fiscal increased over fiscal by the increase is a result of the larger loss before income taxes in the current year 
the effective tax rate of in fiscal is lower than the federal and state statutory tax rate due to the loss on the msc investment  which created a capital loss 
the realization of the capital loss will not occur until we generate capital gains 
during fiscal  the company concluded it was more likely than not that such 
table of contents capital gains will not occur and the company placed a valuation allowance of on the deferred tax asset arising from the msc capital loss 
net income loss we had a net loss of  in fiscal compared to net loss of  and  for fiscal and respectively 
the loss in fiscal was partly attributable to the establishment of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset 
other factors include the rapid decline in revenue during the year matched against the fixed costs of our manufacturing as well as our commitment to continue our research and development 
the net loss in fiscal was primarily a result of the operating loss and closure of the mexico division  including the accounts receivable write off  and the impairment charge for msc 
excluding mexico and msc  the net loss for fiscal was financial condition our net cash flow provided by operating activities for fiscal was  compared to net cash provided used of  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
for fiscal the cash flow generated was mainly a result of decreases in accounts receivable  and from the non cash expense of depreciation  and deferred income tax asset of 
these improvements offset the net loss for the year of  the decrease in accounts receivable  and inventories is attributable primarily to the decrease in revenue over the last quarter of fiscal as compared to fiscal net cash provided by operating activities totaled  in fiscal compared to net cash used in operating activities of  for fiscal this was a result of higher revenue in fiscal  which caused higher accounts receivable and inventory balances offset by higher accounts payable balances when compared to fiscal our net cash flow used in investing activities was   and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the company spent  on capital expenditures and patent costs in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the million increase in restricted cash for fiscal is the result of the december  loan modification  which requires an additional repayment of the company s long term debt 
during fiscal we spent  on capital expenditures offset by the maturities of investments of  the capital expenditures in all three years relate to facility improvements and purchases of manufacturing equipment to enhance our production capabilities and quality control systems 
our fiscal capital expenditure plan is currently approximately our net cash flow provided by financing activities was   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
cash generated from issuance of common stock was   and for fiscal year  and respectively 
during fiscal the company completed a private placement of common stock that generated  in net proceeds 
other issuance of common stock during the past three fiscal years were from the exercise of stock options 
the majority of other year to year changes relate to the borrowings and repayment under the revolving line of credit and term debt 
the result of these activities was that cash increased decreased by   and  during fiscal  and respectively 
at the end of fiscal our unrestricted cash balance was  as a result of the amended bank covenants on december    of cash will be used to reduce our long term bank debt and has been reflected as restricted cash on the august  balance sheet 
accounts receivable average days outstanding was days at august   compared to and days at august  and respectively 
inventory turns were  and  for the years ended august   and  respectively 
the decreased days outstanding and decreased inventory turns were primarily due to the slow down in revenue in the last quarter of the fiscal versus fiscal and during the last half of fiscal compared to fiscal  due to a general slow down in the economy and throughout the industry and the markets we serve 
the current ratio at the end of fiscal was as compared to and at the end of fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal to fiscal is principally due to additions to 
table of contents property and equipment and payments on long term debt with the million increase in current maturities of long term debt exceeding the million generated by operating activities 
based on the modified bank covenants  amended december   and the retroactive repayment of million of long term debt  the current ratio at the end of fiscal would have been the increase in fiscal over fiscal is mainly due to increased cash and cash equivalents and reduced outstanding revolving line of credit balances as a result of the  private placement of common stock completed in august we have a maximum of  available under the revolving line of credit  based on the accounts receivable balance outstanding  and a  capital expenditure term loan  subject to certain restrictions listed below  each of which expire in august see notes and under notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of august   there were  and  of borrowings under the line of credit and capital expenditure term loan facility  respectively 
these borrowings are subject to certain restrictive financial covenants  including but not limited to tangible net worth  interest coverage ratio  debt service coverage ratio  annual loss limitations and the ability to declare or pay dividends 
the general economic slowdown in the hearing  rfid and other electronic contract manufacturing markets in which we operate have resulted in adverse operating results in fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal due to these adverse operating results  we were not in compliance with the covenants at august  and november  on november  we amended the agreement with the financial institution  which waived the events of default at august  and on december  we amended the agreements to waive the defaults as of november  the december   amendment also reset the covenants for the remainder fiscal these revised bank covenants reduced the overall revolving line of credit from maximum amount of  to  and required the company to prepay million on december  of long term debt relating to the financing of manufacturing equipment 
we are currently in compliance with the new bank covenants and  based on current financial projections and new covenants  we believe that we will meet the bank covenants going forward and have classified the debt per the terms of the respective agreements 
we have experienced substantial fluctuations in our annual and quarterly operating results and such fluctuations may continue in future periods 
adverse operating results could result in an event of default with our bank agreement for not meeting certain financial and other restrictive covenants  such as  tangible net worth  interest coverage ratio  debt service coverage ratio and year to date net loss 
failure to meet these covenants could require us to immediately repay our outstanding balances  find a new lender  which may cause us to incur costs in connection with such new lending relationship  incur increased borrowing rates and amendment fees  incur additional restrictions on our ability to borrow additional funds 
any one of these factors  or a combination of one or more factors  could adversely affect our ability to borrow funds or adversely affect future operating results 
we have idrbs outstanding totaling  these bonds were originally issued in april in connection with the construction of a new addition to the company s manufacturing facility in victoria  minnesota  and for production equipment purchases 
in april of each year  these bonds require annual principal payments of the company has limited market risk with of the variability of the interest rate on these bonds 
the bonds bear interest at a rate  which varies weekly  based on comparable tax exempt issues  and are limited to a maximum rate of 
the interest rate at august  and  was and  respectively 
the bonds are collateralized by two irrevocable letters of credit and essentially all of our property and equipment 
a commitment fee is paid annually to the bank at a rate of of the letters of credit 
at various times over the past two years we have not been in compliance with our bank covenants 
we have successfully been able to obtain waivers and reset the covenants in the past 
however  if we were not in compliance and could not obtain waivers or amendments  it would have severe negative impact our cash position and require us to seek alternative funding sources of which there can be no assurance as to their availability 
although we are in compliance with the bank covenants  the financial institution has put certain restrictions on our ability to borrow additional funds under the capital expenditure term loan facility 
these restrictions require us to be profitable for four consecutive quarters prior to allowing additional borrowings 
table of contents under the capital expenditure term loan facility 
as a result of these restrictions  we are currently not able to borrow additional funds under the capital expenditure term loan facility 
we continue to work to increase sales and improve our operating results to meet this covenant and regain the ability to borrow additional funds under the capital expenditure loan facility 
during fiscal  the company intends to expend approximately for manufacturing equipment and minor facility improvements 
these additions  if made  will increase manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated production requirements and add technological capabilities 
it is expected that these expenditures will be funded from operations  existing cash and cash equivalents and available debt financing for the next months 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents  current lending capacity and cash generated from operations will provide sufficient cash flow for the company to meet its short and long term debt obligations and operating requirements 
the company s contractual cash obligations at august  are summarized in the following table thereafter total long term debt operating leases total contractual obligations risk factors in thousands except per share amounts this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that are based on our current expectations and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
factors that may materially affect revenues  expenses and operating results include  without limitation  adverse business or market conditions  our ability to secure and satisfy customers  the availability and cost of materials from suppliers  adverse competitive developments  and change in or cancellation of customer requirements 
the forward looking statements included herein are based on current assumptions that we will continue to develop  market  manufacture and ship products on a timely basis  that competitive conditions within our markets will not change materially or adversely  that we will continue to identify and satisfy customer needs for products and services  that we will be able to retain and hire key personnel  that our equipment  processes  capabilities and resources will remain competitive and compatible with the current state of technology  that risks due to shifts in customer demand will be minimized  and that there will be no material adverse change in our operations or business 
assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments that are based on incomplete information and are subject to many factors that can materially affect results 
we operate in a volatile segment of high technology markets and applications that are subject to rapid change and technical obsolescence 
because of these and other factors affecting our operating results  past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
the following factors also may materially affect results and therefore should be considered 
liquidity and capital resources 
as a result of fiscal operating losses and the downturn in the economy  which has adversely affected our sales trends  our current cash flows may not be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs 
our cash needs are further impacted by i the lower sales volumes in fiscal year  ii the volatility we continue to experience from our customers demand for the products we produce  iii our ability to maintain the credit facilities currently in place with our senior lender 
at various times over the past two years we have not been in compliance with our bank covenants 
we have successfully been able to obtain waivers and reset the covenants in the past 
however  if we were not in compliance and could not obtain waivers or amendments  it would have severe negative impact our cash position and require us to seek alternative funding sources 

table of contents since february  we have undertaken efforts to substantially reduce our cost structure as outlined above in workforce reductions and in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in response to the continued depressed economy and evaluation of the related impact on our anticipated sales volumes  we implemented further cost saving initiatives in fiscal see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition 
if the products we design and manufacture are the subject of product recalls or a product liability claim  we may lose revenue  our business reputation may be damaged and we may incur significant legal fees 
a number of the components we design or manufacture are for medical devices 
the tolerance for error in the design  manufacture or use of these products may be small or nonexistent 
if a component we designed or manufactured is found to be defective  whether due to design or manufacturing defects  to improper use of the product or to other reasons  the component or the product in which it is used may need to be recalled  possibly at our expense 
furthermore  the adverse effect of a product recall on our business might not be limited to the cost of the recall 
recalls  especially if accompanied by unfavorable publicity or termination of customer contracts  could result in substantial costs  loss of revenues and damage to our reputation  each of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our customer base is highly concentrated and the loss of a key customer may reduce our operating results and financial condition 
our customer base is highly concentrated 
in fiscal  and  our two largest customers  siemens  inc and sonic innovations  inc  in the aggregate accounted for  and  respectively  of net sales 
each of these customers has multiple programs in production with us 
although we are reducing this concentration  we expect that sales to a relatively small number of original equipment manufacturers will continue to account for a substantial portion of net revenues for the foreseeable future 
the loss of  or a decline in orders from  any one of our key customers would materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we are working for diversification such that no one market would account for or more in revenue  no one customer at or greater revenue and no one program at or greater 
if we are unable to develop new products and services our revenue could decrease 
our products are subject to rapid obsolescence and our future success will depend upon our ability to develop new products and services that meet changing customer and marketplace requirements 
our products are based upon specifications from our customers 
we may not be able to satisfactorily design and manufacture customer products based upon these specifications 
if we fail to properly anticipate the market for new products and service we may lose revenue 
even if we are able to successfully identify  develop and manufacture as well as introduce new products and services  there is no assurance that a market for these products and services will materialize to the size and extent that we anticipate 
if a market does not materialize as we anticipate  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the following factors could affect the success of our products and services in the microelectronic and other marketplaces the failure to adequately equip our manufacturing plant in anticipation of increasing business  the failure of our design team to develop products in a timely manner to satisfy our present and potential customers  or our limited experience in specific market segments in marketing our products and services  specifically in the telecom industry 
we may fail to adequately adjust our expenses to predicted revenue in any given period or we may experience significant fluctuations in quarterly revenue because the sales cycle for our products and services is lengthy and unpredictable 
while our sales cycle varies from customer to customer  it typically has ranged from two to months 
our pursuit of sales leads typically involves an analysis of our prospective customer s needs  preparation of a written proposal  one or more presentations and contract negotiations 
our sales cycle may also be affected by the complexity of the product to be developed and manufactured as well as a 
table of contents prospective customer s budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews  over which we have little or no control 
as a result of these things combined with the fact that our expenses are fixed  we may fail to adequately adjust our expenses to predicted revenue in any given period or we may experience significant fluctuations in quarterly revenue 
our business may suffer and cause our stock price to decline if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
intellectual property rights are important to our success and our competitive position 
it is our policy to protect all proprietary information through the use of a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law to protect our intellectual property rights 
there is no assurance that these agreements  provisions and laws will be adequate to prevent the imitation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
policing unauthorized use of proprietary systems and products is difficult and  while we are unable to determine the extent to which infringement of our intellectual property exists  we expect infringement to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our products to the same extent that the laws of the united states protect our products 
if our intellectual property rights are not protected our business may suffer if a competitor uses our technology to capture our business  which could cause our stock price to decline 
furthermore  even if the agreements  provisions and intellectual property laws prove to be adequate to protect our intellectual property rights  our competitors may develop products or technologies that are both non infringing and substantially equivalent or superior to our products or technologies 
third party intellectual property infringement claims may be costly and may prevent the future sale of our products 
substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in our industry 
third parties may claim that our products infringe upon their intellectual property rights 
in particular  defending against third party infringement claims may be costly and divert important management resources 
furthermore  if these claims are successful  we may have to pay substantial royalties or damages  remove the infringing products from the marketplace or expend substantial amounts in order to modify the products so that they no longer infringe on the third party s rights 
we may pursue future acquisitions and investments that may adversely affect our financial position or cause our earnings per share to decline 
in the future we may continue to make acquisitions of and investments in businesses  products and technologies that could complement or expand our business 
such acquisitions  though  involve certain risks we may not be able to negotiate or finance the acquisition successfully 
the integration of acquired businesses  products or technologies into our existing business may fail 
we may issue equity securities  incur debt  assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write downs of acquired assets which could cause our earnings per share to decline 
if our customers are unable to gain market acceptance for the products that we develop or manufacture for them  we may lose revenue 
we design and manufacture components for other companies 
we also sell proprietary products that contain components to other companies and end user customers 
for products we manufacture manufactured for others or those we sell directly  our success is dependent on the acceptance of those products in their markets 
we have no control over the products or marketing of products that we sell to our customers 
market acceptance may depend on a variety of factors  including educating the target market regarding the use of a new procedure 
market acceptance and market share are also affected by the timing of market introduction of competitive products 
some of our customers  especially emerging growth companies  have limited or no experience in marketing their products and may be unable to establish effective sales and marketing and distribution channels to rapidly and successfully commercialize their products 
if our customers are unable to gain any significant market acceptance for the products we develop or manufacture for them  our business will be adversely affected 
if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations we may be fined and prohibited from manufacturing products 
as a small generator of hazardous substances  we are subject to local governmental regulations relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances  such as waste oil  acetone and alcohol that are used in very small 
table of contents quantities to manufacture our products 
while we are currently in compliance with applicable regulations  if we fail to comply with these regulations substantial fines could be imposed on us and we could be required to suspend production  alter manufacturing processes or cease operations 
future quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate substantially due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  which may cause our stock price to decline 
we have experienced substantial fluctuations in our annual and quarterly operating results  and such fluctuations may continue in future periods 
our operating results are affected by a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the following we may manufacture products that are custom designed and assembled for a specific customer s requirement in anticipation of the receipt of volume production orders from that customer  which may not always materialize to the degree anticipated  if at all  we may incur significant start up costs in the production of a particular product  which costs are expensed as incurred and for which we attempt to seek reimbursement from the customer  we may experience fluctuations and inefficiencies in managing inventories  fixed assets  components and labor  in the degree of automation used in the assembly process  in the costs of materials  and the mix of materials  labor  manufacturing  and overhead costs  we may experience unforeseen design or manufacturing problems  price competition or functional competition other means of accomplishing the same or similar packaging end result  we may be unable to pass on cost overruns  we may not have control over the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  customer product delivery requirements and the range of services provided  and we may experience variance in the amount and timing of orders placed by a customer due to a number of factors  including inventory balancing  changes in manufacturing strategy  and variation in product demand attributable to  among other things  product life cycles  competitive factors  and general economic conditions 
any one of these factors  or a combination of one or more factors  could adversely affect our annual and quarterly operating results  which in turn may cause our stock price to decline 
we are dependent on a single industry and adverse trends in that industry may reduce our revenues 
during the past several years  we have been significantly dependent on a single market 
in fiscal  and   and  respectively of our net sales came from the hearing instrument and medical manufacturers 
these industries are characterized by intense competition  relatively short product life cycles  rapid technological change  significant fluctuations in product demand and significant pressure on vendors to reduce or minimize cost 
accordingly  we may be adversely affected by these industry trends to the extent that they reduce our revenues 
in particular  if the hearing instrument manufacturers develop new technologies that do not incorporate our products  or if our competitors offer similar products at a lower cost to such manufacturers  our revenues may decrease and our business would be adversely affected 
although we are attempting to reduce our dependence on a single industry  we do not expect this historic dependence to change dramatically or quickly 
moreover  a significant amount of our non hearing instrument industry sales are made in the medical products industry  which is characterized by trends similar to those in the hearing instrument manufacturer industry 
we may lose business and revenues if we fail to successfully compete with our customers for business 
we face competition from the internal operations of our current and potential original equipment manufacturer customers and from offshore contract manufacturers  which  because of their lower labor rates and other related factors  may enjoy a comparative advantage over us with respect to high volume production 
we expect to continue to encounter competition from other electronics manufacturers that currently provide or may begin to provide contract design and manufacturing services 

table of contents a number of our competitors may have substantially greater manufacturing  financial  technical  marketing  and other resources than we have  and may offer a broader scope and presence of operations on a worldwide basis 
significant competitive factors in the microelectronics market include price  quality  design capabilities  responsiveness  testing capabilities  the ability to manufacture in very high volumes and proximity to the customers final assembly facilities 
while we have competed favorably in the past with respect to these factors  this is a particularly fast changing market  and there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so in the future 
we are often one of two or more suppliers on any particular customer requirement and are  therefore  subject to continuing competition on existing programs 
in order to remain competitive in any of our markets  we must continually provide timely and technologically advanced design capabilities and manufacturing services  ensure the quality of our products  and compete favorably with respect to turnaround and price 
if we fail to compete favorably with respect to the principal competitive factors in the markets we serve  we may lose business and our operating results may be reduced 
fluctuations in the price and supply of components used to manufacture our products may reduce our profits 
substantially all of our manufacturing services are provided on a turnkey basis in which we  in addition to providing design  assembly and testing services  are responsible for the procurement of the components that are assembled by us for our customers 
although we attempt to minimize margin erosion as a result of component price increases  in certain circumstances we are required to bear some or all of the risk of such price fluctuations  which could adversely affect our profits 
to date  we have generally been able to negotiate contracts that allow us to shift much of the impact of price fluctuations to the customer  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in all cases 
in order to assure an adequate supply of certain key components that have long procurement lead times  such as integrated circuits  we occasionally must order such components prior to receiving formal customer purchase orders for the assemblies that require such components 
failure to accurately anticipate the volume or timing of customer orders can result in component shortages or excess component inventory  which in either case could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
certain of the assemblies manufactured by us require one or more components that are ordered from  or which may be available from  only one source or a limited number of sources 
delivery problems relating to components purchased from any of our key suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance 
from time to time  our suppliers allocate components among their customers in response to supply shortages 
in some cases  supply shortages will substantially curtail production of all assemblies using a particular component 
in addition  at various times there have been industry wide shortages of electronic components 
while we have not experienced sustained periods of shortages of components in the recent past  there can be no assurance that substantial component shortages will not occur in the future 
any such shortages could reduce our operating results 
our costs may increase significantly if we are unable to forecast customer orders and production schedules 
the level and timing of orders placed by customers vary due to the customers attempts to balance their inventory  changes in customers manufacturing strategies  and variations in demand for the customers products 
due in part to these factors  most of our customers do not commit to firm production schedules more than several weeks in advance of requirements 
our inability to forecast the level of customers orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and optimize utilization of manufacturing capacity 
this uncertainty could also significantly increase our costs related to manufacturing product 
in the past  we have been required to increase staffing and incur other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demands of our customers 
from time to time  anticipated orders from some of our customers have failed to materialize and delivery schedules have been deferred as a result of changes in a customer s business needs  both of which have adversely affected our operating results 
on other occasions  customers have required rapid increases in production that have placed an excessive burden on our resources 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience similar fluctuations in customer demand in the future 
we may have a significant accounts receivable write off and well as an increase in inventory reserve due to the inability of our customers to pay their accounts 
we may carry significant accounts receivable and 
table of contents inventory in connection with providing manufacturing services to our customers 
if one or more of our principal customers were to become insolvent  or otherwise fail to pay for the services and materials provided by us  our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
our business success may be adversely affected by our ability to hire and retain employees 
our continued growth and success depend to a significant extent on the continued service of senior management and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees 
we rely upon the acquisition and retention of employees with extensive technological experience 
competition for skilled business  product development  technical and other personnel is intense 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in recruiting new personnel and retaining existing personnel 
none of our employees are subject to a long term employment agreement  although several key employees are subject to non competition agreements 
the loss of one or more key employees may materially adversely affect our growth 
we do not currently have employment contracts with any of our employees 
the price of our common stock may be adversely affected by significant price fluctuations due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
the market price of the common stock may be significantly affected by many factors  including changes in requirements or demands for our services  the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  technological innovations by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our or our competitors operating results  changes in prices of our or our competitors products and services  changes in our revenue and revenue growth rates  changes in earnings estimates by market analysts  speculation in the press or analyst community  and general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries 
the stock prices for many companies in the technology sector have experienced wide fluctuations that often have been unrelated to their operating performance 
such fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws may discourage lawsuits and other claims against our directors 
our articles of incorporation provide  to the fullest extent permitted by minnesota law  that our directors shall have no personal liability for breaches of their fiduciary duties to us 
in addition  our bylaws provide for mandatory indemnification of directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by minnesota law 
these provisions may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for a breach of their duty 
we have issued numerous options to acquire our common stock that could have a dilutive effect on our common stock 
as of december   we had options outstanding to acquire  shares of our common stock  exercisable at prices ranging from to per share  with a weighted average exercise price of approximately per share 
during the terms of these options  the holders will have the opportunity to profit from either an increase in the market price of our common stock with resulting dilution to the holders of shares who purchased shares for a price higher than the respective exercise or conversion price 
in addition  the increase in the outstanding shares of our common stock as a result of the exercise or conversion of these options could result in a significant decrease in the percentage ownership of our common stock by the purchasers of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock may be reduced by future sales of our common stock in the public market 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market that are not currently freely tradable  or even the potential for such sales  could have an adverse effect on the market price for shares of our 
table of contents common stock and could impair the ability of purchasers of our common stock to recoup their investment or make a profit 
as of december   these shares consist of approximately  shares beneficially owned by our executive officers and directors of our outstanding common stock  and approximately  shares issuable to option and warrant holders 
unless the shares of our outstanding common stock owned by our executive officers and directors are further registered under the securities laws  they may not be resold except in compliance with rule promulgated by the sec  or some other exemption from registration 
rule does not prohibit the sale of these shares but does place conditions on their resale that must be complied with before they can be resold 
our amended and restated articles of incorporation contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover  even if such transaction would be beneficial to our shareholders 
our amended and restated articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to  shares of common stock and  shares of undesignated stock  the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by the board of directors  without further action by our shareholders 
undesignated stock authorized by the board of directors may include voting rights  preferences as to dividends and liquidation  conversion and redemptive rights and sinking fund provisions that could affect the rights of the holders of our common stock and reduce the value of our common stock 
the issuance of preferred stock could also prevent a potential takeover because the terms of any issued preferred stock may require the approval of the holders of the outstanding shares of preferred stock in order to consummate a merger  reorganization  and sale of substantially all of our assets or other extraordinary corporate transaction 
our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms 
our amended and restated articles of incorporation also require the affirmative vote of a supermajority of the voting power for the following matters to approve the merger or consolidation of hei or any subsidiary with or into any person that directly or indirectly beneficially owns  or owned at any time in the preceding twelve months  five percent or more of the outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote in elections of directors a related person  to authorize the sale of substantially all of our assets to a related person  to authorize the issuance of any of our voting securities in exchange or payment for the securities or assets of any related person  if such authorization is otherwise required by law or any agreement  to adopt any plan for the dissolution of hei  or to adopt any amendment  change or repeal of certain articles of the amended and restated articles of incorporation  including the articles that establish the authority of the board of directors  the supermajority voting requirements and the classified board of directors 
these provisions may have the effect of deterring a potential takeover or delaying changes in control or our management 
future quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate substantially due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  which may cause us to be out of compliance with our debt covenants 
we have experienced substantial fluctuations in our annual and quarterly operating results and such fluctuations may continue in future periods 
adverse operating results could result in an event of default with our bank agreement for not meeting certain financial and other restrictive covenants  such as  tangible net worth  interest coverage ratio  debt service coverage ratio and year to date net loss 
failure to meet these covenants could require us to immediately repay our outstanding balances  find a new lender  which may cause us to incur costs in connection with such new lending relationship  incur increased borrowing rates and amendment fees  
table of contents incur additional restrictions on our ability to borrow additional funds 
any one of these factors  or a combination of one or more factors  could adversely affect our ability to borrow funds or adversely affect future operating results 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk in thousands we are exposed to certain market risks with our revolving line of credit  capital expenditure loans and  to a lesser extent  our idrbs 
at august   the outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit  capital expenditure loans and idrbs were   and  respectively 
effective december  the revolving line of credit agreement bears interest  at the company s option  at above the prime rate of interest or above the libor rate 
the capital expenditure loans bears interest  at the company s option  at above the prime rate of interest or above the libor rate 
at august   the interest rates on the revolving commitment and capital expenditure loans were and  respectively 
the idrbs bear interest at a rate  which varies weekly  based on comparable tax exempt issues  and is limited to a maximum rate of 
at august   the interest rate on the idrbs was 
consequently  the company is exposed to a change in borrowing costs as interest rates change 
we have completed a market risk sensitivity analysis of these debt instruments based upon an assumed increase in interest rates at august  if market interest rates had increased by on august   this would have resulted in an increase to interest expense of approximately over a one year period 
because this is only an estimate  any actual change in expense due to a change in interest rates could differ from this estimate
