item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a provider of outpatient healthcare services in florida 
we provide healthcare services through our network of staff model clinics  ipas and home health agencies 
we provide healthcare services through fifteen staff model clinics  approximately ipa associated physicians and four home health agencies to some of the nation s largest managed care organizations  including i humana for which  as of june   we managed the care for approximately  patients on a pop basis  and ii foundation  for which  as of june   we managed the care for approximately  patients on a pop basis 
accounting policies general we have adopted accounting policies which we believe will result in an accurate presentation of our financial position 
we consider critical accounting policies to be those that require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements and include the following revenue recognition  recording the cost of health care services  and consideration of impairment of intangible assets 
revenue recognition revenue is recorded in the period services are rendered as determined by the respective contract 
under our contracts with hmos  we receive a percentage of premium that is paid by or on behalf of each covered life that chooses our physicians as their primary care physicians in exchange for assuming responsibility for the provision of medical services 
to the extent that patients require more frequent or expensive care  our revenue under a contract may be insufficient to cover the costs of care provided 
when it is probable that expected future health care costs and maintenance costs under a contract or group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated pop revenue on those contracts  we recognize losses on our prepaid healthcare services with hmos 
no contracts are considered loss contracts at june  because we have the right to terminate unprofitable physicians and close unprofitable centers under our managed care contracts 
amounts received for treatment of individuals covered by medicare  medicaid and other contracted reimbursement programs  which may be based on the cost of services provided or predetermined rates  are generally less than the established billing rates of our facilities 
final determination of amounts received from medicare and medicaid is subject to review and audit by the appropriate agencies 
differences between amounts recorded as estimated settlements and the audited amounts are reflected as adjustments to revenues in the period the final determination is made 
recording the cost of health care services the cost of health care services provided or contracted for is accrued in the period in which the services are provided 
on a monthly basis we provide for claims incurred but not reported based on past experience together with current factors 
estimates are adjusted as changes in these factors occur and such adjustments are reported in the period of determination 
an actuarial calculation has been completed and indicates that claims incurred but not reported as of june  are between approximately  and  as of june   we have recorded a liability of approximately  for claims incurred but not reported 
although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  we believe that the amounts accrued for incurred but not reported medical claims are adequate 
consideration of impairment of costs in excess of net tangible assets we evaluate the recovery of the carrying amount of costs in excess of net tangible assets acquired by determining if a permanent impairment has occurred 
this evaluation is done annually or more frequently if indicators of permanent impairment arise 
indicators of a permanent impairment include  among other things  significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate  an adverse action by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel or allocation of goodwill to a portion of business that is to be sold 
as we operate in a single segment of business  that of managing the provision of outpatient health care and health care related services in the state of florida  management has determined that we have a single reporting unit and perform the annual impairment calculation for goodwill on an entity level 
in performing the impairment test  we compare our fair value  as determined by the current market value of our common stock  to the current carrying value of the total assets  including goodwill and intangible assets 
we perform our annual impairment test on may st of each year 
in addition to the annual impairment test  we are required to perform an impairment test any time an indicator of impairment occurs  such as those noted above 
at such time as an impairment is determined  the intangible assets are written off during that period 
although considerable care is taken to ensure that impairment losses are recorded as soon as indicators of impairment are noted  material differences could occur if different  but nonetheless reasonably plausible  indicators existed 
results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items in our consolidated statements of operations 
percent of revenue for june  medical services revenue  net other income subtotal expenses medical services payroll and employee benefits provision for bad debts professional fees general and administrative gain on disposal of property and equipment depreciation and amortization gain on extinguishment of debt subtotal income from operations other income expense interest income interest expense convertible subordinated notes interest expense other provision for medicare settlement related to terminated operations other net loss income the financial results discussed below relate to our operations for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the fiscal year ended june  revenue medical services revenue for fiscal decreased to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal we provided managed care services for approximately  and  member months members per month multiplied by the months for which services were available during fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in revenue and member months primarily resulted from an amendment the amendment to our independent practice association ipa contract with foundation the amendment 
among other things  the amendment terminated our association with certain physician practices effective april  through may   which represented approximately of the foundation ipa s membership at that time 
the foundation ipa s member months were approximately  and  during fiscal and  respectively 
revenue generated by our managed care entities under contracts with hmo s as a percentage of medical services revenue was approximately during fiscal and revenue generated by the humana contract was and of medical service revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
revenue generated by the foundation contracts was and during fiscal and  respectively 
our home health agencies revenue was approximately of medical services revenue during fiscal and and consisted primarily of medicare reimbursement 
other income of  during fiscal represents a settlement payment received from a vendor regarding a dispute which arose during the year 
no such payments were received in fiscal expenses effective march   the amendment  among other things  eliminated the medical claims liability incurred by the foundation ipa through march  and reduced other liabilities to foundation 
as a result  we recorded a contractual revision of previously recorded medical claims liability of approximately  the contractual adjustment 
medical services expenses for fiscal were approximately  or of medical services revenue compared to approximately  or of medical services revenue for fiscal excluding the contractual adjustment 
medical claims represent the costs of medical services provided by providers other than us but which are to be paid by us for individuals covered by our pop risk contracts with hmos 
claims expense was approximately  and  for fiscal and  respectively  or and of medical services revenues derived from our managed care entities prior to the contractual adjustment of claims expense 
our claims loss ratio varies due to fluctuations in utilization as well as increases in medical costs without counterbalancing increases in premium revenues 
medical claims as a percentage of revenues declined in fiscal  primarily due to decreased utilization and various benefit changes instituted by the hmos that became effective january   such as requiring copayments for certain prescription drugs in selected counties in which we operate 
these positive trends were offset  to some extent  in the fourth quarter by an increase in the cost of stop loss insurance provided by foundation for our medicare members of approximately per member per month 
all other factors remaining the same  this increase in the cost of our stop loss insurance provided by foundation will increase our medical claims costs in fiscal by approximately  above the costs incurred in fiscal other direct costs include the salaries and benefits of health professionals providing primary care services  capitation payments to our contracted primary care ipa physicians  and other costs necessary to operate our facilities 
other direct costs were approximately  and  during fiscal and  respectively  or and of medical services revenues 
the decrease in other direct costs is primarily due to the amendment which resulted in the termination of our association with certain physician practices effective april  through may  payroll and employee benefits for administrative personnel was approximately  or of total revenue during fiscal compared to approximately  or of total revenue during fiscal general and administrative expenses during fiscal were approximately  or of total revenue compared to approximately  or of total revenue during fiscal we anticipate that the cost of our directors and officers insurance coverage will increase in fiscal depreciation and amortization for fiscal decreased approximately to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal effective july  we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no

under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized  but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and also reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
amortization expense of approximately  was recorded in fiscal for goodwill that was not subject to amortization in fiscal under sfas no 
additionally  certain tangible assets became fully depreciated and other intangible assets became fully amortized during fiscal depreciation and amortization expense during fiscal was reduced by approximately  for these fully depreciated and amortized assets 
effective june   we completed a restructuring the fiscal restructuring of our convertible subordinated notes due the notes and as a result recorded a gain on the extinguishment of debt of approximately  the gain resulted primarily from the conversion of  of the outstanding principal balance into  shares of common stock  which were valued at approximately  based on the closing price of our common stock on june   the recording of approximately  of interest which will accrue on the remaining balance of the notes under the revised terms of the agreement through the maturity date of october   the recording of a new note payable the new note in the amount of  and the recording of approximately  of interest which will accrue on the new note 
we have not provided for income taxes on the gain because we believe we will be able to utilize certain of our net operating loss carryforwards to offset any income tax liability related to this transaction 
income from operations income from operations for fiscal was approximately  or 
of total revenues  compared to approximately  or of total revenues for fiscal interest expense interest expense during fiscal was approximately  or of total revenues compared to approximately  or of total revenues during fiscal interest expense during fiscal consisted primarily of approximately  related to amortization of deferred financing costs  approximately  of imputed interest expense on non interest bearing notes  interest expense of approximately  on the credit facility and interest expense of approximately  related to various notes payable 
interest expense during fiscal consisted primarily of approximately  related to amortization of deferred financing costs  approximately  of imputed interest expense on non interest bearing notes  interest expense of approximately  on the credit facility and interest expense of approximately  related to various notes payable

on april   we sold substantially all the assets of rms and the assumption of certain liabilities to kessler rehabilitation of florida  inc on august   rms was formally dissolved as a corporation with the state of florida 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we became aware that cms was pursuing ihs  kessler and rms for collection of principal and interest for certain alleged medicare overpayments made to providers purchased from ihs or linked to the purchased entities through the use of a common provider number for services rendered during calendar years  and we were aware of our obligation to cms for any overpayments for services rendered by the providers during calendar years and at the time the cost reports were completed and submitted to cms for services rendered by the providers during calendar years and  we recorded an estimate for the overpayments indicated on those cost reports 
when we purchased rms  the purchase agreement included indemnification from ihs for any overpayments prior to calendar year subsequent to our purchase of rms  ihs sought protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code and  as such  is protected from cms and rms efforts to collect on the alleged overpayments that relate to calendar year during the third quarter of fiscal  it became clear that we were being pursued by cms as the primary obligor for all of the alleged overpayments  including the calendar year while we dispute the validity of these claims  in an effort to expedite the resolution of these matters and halt cms aggressive collection procedures which included the threat of withholding payments to our home health agencies  we have entered into a memorandum of understanding for the cost report year and have recorded an approximately  provision for medicare settlement related to terminated operations during the quarter ended march  under this memorandum  we will make monthly payments of  for months with the balance of the memorandum due at the end of the term 
we have retained the right to dispute the alleged overpayments and continue to review and evaluate all information available to determine the validity of cms claims 
during september  we have requested a reopening of the cost reports and supplied various documentation for cost report years and to demonstrate that the alleged overpayments are incorrect 
the accrual for all alleged overpayments is approximately  as of june   of which approximately  is reflected in current liabilities

see note of the our consolidated financial statements 
net income loss net loss for fiscal was approximately  compared to net income of approximately  for fiscal liquidity and capital resources our auditors opinion on the june  consolidated financial statements states that  although our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  there is a significant uncertainty as to whether we will be able to fund our obligations and satisfy our debt obligations as they become due in fiscal at june   our working capital deficit was approximately  our total indebtedness accounted for approximately of our total capitalization and we had approximately million outstanding under our credit facility 
our cash flow from operations in fiscal was not sufficient to satisfy our debt obligations as they became due  including payments on various notes payable  and fund our capital expenditures 
we funded our cash deficit in fiscal from our credit facility 
however  on august   we drew down the remaining available balance under the credit facility 
the credit facility matures on march  we obtained this credit facility in fiscal based on the personal guarantee of dr 
phillip frost and an entity controlled by charles fernandez  former members of our board of directors 
their guarantee is effective through the march  maturity date 
based on our current cash flow projections  it appears unlikely that we will have sufficient funds available to fully repay the credit facility by march  while we intend to address this issue by either extending or replacing the credit facility  either in whole or in part  an uncertainty exists as to whether we will be able to extend or replace the credit facility without either the guarantors extending their guarantees or other individuals providing a personal guarantee 
if personal guarantees are required  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such guarantees 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our attempts to either repay  extend or replace the credit facility and  if so  if this will occur on terms acceptable to us 
in fiscal  we instituted a series of measures intended to reduce losses incurred in prior years and to operate our core business model profitably 
in spite of the measures instituted in fiscal  we began to experience a deterioration in our claims loss ratio in the first and second quarters of fiscal and again in the first and second quarters of fiscal  which resulted in operating losses and negative cash flow from operations 
additionally  the impact of the deterioration of the claims loss ratio did not allow us to reverse a significant working capital deficiency which originated in prior years 
negative changes in the claims loss ratio  such as we experienced in fiscal and  are due to increases in the utilization of health services as well as increases in medical costs without counterbalancing increases in premium revenues from the hmos 
see risk factor our percentage of premium contracts require us to assume the responsibility of providing medical care to our managed care patients 
if we should experience a deterioration in our claims loss ratio in the first two quarters of fiscal that  compounded by the lack of availability of additional financing through our credit facility and the need to make annual payments for our medical malpractice insurance which are due in the first and second quarters of fiscal  we will experience a severe strain on our cash flow 
historically  we have been able to realize advantageous hmo benefit changes and premium increases in the third quarter of our fiscal year which have a positive impact on profitability and cash flow 
however  there can be no assurance that any benefit changes will occur or be realized in the third quarter of fiscal or that premium increases  if any will be able to offset negative health cost trends and allow us to meet our cash requirements in fiscal we plan to fund our capital commitments  operating cash requirements and satisfy our obligations from a combination of cash on hand and operating cash flow improvements realized from decreased utilization  hmo premium increases and advantageous hmo benefit changes 
we continue to focus on strengthening our core business unit by enhancing our physician net work  streamlining our operations and implementing measures to contain the rising costs of providing health services to our members 
such measures include  among other things  emphasizing preventive care  encouraging frequent health check ups  monitoring compliance with drug therapies  entering into our own contracts with health care providers such as medical specialists and recommending that our members utilize hospitals and outpatient facilities that have favorable rate structures 
if we cannot continue to improve our controls and procedures for managing our costs  our business  results of operations  and cash flow may be materially adversely affected and we may be unable to meet our financial obligations as they become due 
if we are unable to satisfy our cash requirements  we may be required to take certain steps  such as borrowing additional funds  restructuring our indebtedness  selling assets  selling equity  reducing or delaying capital expenditures or payments to trade creditors and forgoing certain business opportunities 
if we need additional capital to repay our obligations or fund operations  there can be no assurances that such capital can be obtained or  if obtained  that it will be on terms acceptable to us 
the incurring or assumption of additional indebtedness could result in the issuance of additional equity and or debt which can have a dilutive effect on current shareholders and a significant effect on our operations 
our net loss was approximately  for fiscal net cash provided by operations was approximately  the following were the most significant items which are reflected in our net loss but did not affect our cash flows from operations depreciation and amortization  including the amortization of deferred loan costs  reduced net income by approximately  without reducing cash from operations 
the increase in due to medicare was approximately  we recorded approximately  as a provision for a medicare settlement and approximately  for other medicare overpayments related to our home health operations for which we have entered into long term repayment plans 
these liabilities are included in long term debt  with the appropriate amounts shown in the current portion of long term debt  and although they increased our net loss  did not affect our cash flows from operations 
additionally  the due to medicare also increased by approximately  this increase reflects the current receivable from medicare generated from our current home health operations as offset by additional amounts due to medicare for which we intend to request long term repayment plans in the future 
this net increase in due to medicare of approximately  increased our fiscal net loss  but did not impact the cash flows from operations in fiscal our net receivable from hmos increased by approximately  and reduced our net loss  but did not provide cash in fiscal the following were significant items that affected our cash flows but did not affect our net loss increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets of approximately  used cash from operations but did not affect our net loss in fiscal decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately  used cash from operations but did not affect our net loss in fiscal our cash used in investing activities was approximately  for fiscal  primarily for the purchase of equipment 
our cash used in financing activities was approximately  primarily due to borrowings during the year of  on our credit facility and payments of various notes payable of approximately  approximately of our medical services revenue during fiscal was derived from our hhas 
effective october   two of our hhas  which primarily provide services to patients eligible under the medicare program  began to be reimbursed by medicare under the prospective payment system 
under pps  we are paid a predetermined fee for services provided to patients for every day period for which care is rendered 
effective october   we will be subject to a reduction to the cost limits and per patient limits that were in place as of september  as a result of the balanced budget act of this reduction will result in a decrease in the predetermined fees under pps  on average  by approximately to in the localities in which we operate our hhas 
congress may delay the implementation of this reduction in the predetermined fees  however  there can be no assurances that such a delay will occur 
we continue to take steps to operate effectively and efficiently under pps predetermined fee schedule 
this reduction in the reimbursement under pps predetermined fee schedule will have a negative impact on our business  results of operations and cash flow 
prior to the implementation of pps  our hhas were reimbursed for services provided based on a reasonable cost methodology 
we were reimbursed for cost reimbursable items at a tentative rate with final settlement determined after submission of annual cost reports and subsequent audits by cms 
changes in the estimated settlements we recorded may be adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined and may have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and cash flow 
see note of our consolidated financial statements regarding amounts currently due to cms 
one of our hmo contracts requires that we fund a claims reserve out of operating profits of certain of our staff model clinics 
at june   the unfunded portion of this required reserve was approximately  the hmo can only draw upon this reserve in the event that the staff model clinics in question have incurred an account deficit and that we are unable or unwilling to satisfy the hmos demand to fund the deficit 
at no time during fiscal were the staff model clinics in question in an account deficit position 
at june   we were not in compliance with the repayment terms of a contract modification note with an hmo 
the balance of approximately  outstanding at june  has been classified as a current liability in our consolidated financial statements 
while no such action has occurred  the hmo could pursue legal action to enforce their claim against us for repayment of this note 
we are currently in negotiation with the hmo to restructure this indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete this restructuring on terms acceptable to us or that the hmo will not assert a claim against us 
other factors that could affect our liquidity and cash flow are discussed elsewhere in this annual report  including risk factors and include i increasing costs of health care services  ii loss of a material contract  iii decreases in reimbursement rates by third party payors  iv retroactive cost report adjustments  v adverse governmental regulation  vi damage awards under pending or future litigation  and vii increased insurance costs 
on july   the american stock exchange notified us it had completed its review of our listing qualifications and has accepted our plan to regain compliance with continued listing standards by december  the plan includes quarterly milestones 
if we do not show progress in obtaining these milestones or if we are unable to regain compliance with the continued listing standards by december   our common stock may be delisted from the exchange 
as of the date of this filing  we are still below the continued listing requirements of the exchange with respect to requirements which include the need for us to maintain stockholders equity of at least million and not sustain losses from continuing operations and or net losses in two of our three most recent fiscal years 
we are unable to guarantee that the exchange will continue to list our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s at june   our cash equivalents were invested in high grade  very short term securities  which are not typically subject to material market risk 
we have loans outstanding at fixed rates 
for loans with fixed interest rates  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have no impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments and would have an immaterial impact on the fair value of these instruments 
our credit facility is interest rate sensitive 
a basis point adverse movement increase in interest rates would have increased the net loss for fiscal by approximately  a basis point adverse movement increase in interest rates would have had an immaterial impact in our net loss for fiscal we have no material risk associated with foreign currency exchange rates or commodity prices
