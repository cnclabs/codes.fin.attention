item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statements in this report may be forward looking 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in the risk factors included in this report

net sales 
our net sales increased by over to billion in  following a increase to billion in from billion in and were week years  was a week year 
distribution segment net sales increased in and in the net growth in was a result of several factors including increased activity with kmart  acquisitions of certain assets of miller hartman south and the stock of minter weisman co 
combined annualized sales of approximately million and growth in distribution sales from a wide variety of new channel and conventional customers  offset by customer closings and the consolidation of self distributing chains 
new channel customers  including convenience stores  supercenters  limited assortment stores  drug stores and self distributing chains  are an important part of our strategic growth plan 
sales to customers other than kmart increased over in compared to over on a week comparable basis 
in  the increase in sales was primarily due to new business added from independent retailers  convenience stores  e tailers  and supercenter customers  including super target stores 
this increase was partially offset by a loss of previously announced sales from randall s in and united in 
in  sales to randall s and united accounted for less than of our total sales 
we expect sales to customers other than kmart to increase at least in  factoring in known losses due to bankruptcies  customer closings and the consolidation of self distributing chains 
kmart corporation  our largest customer  accounted for and of our total net sales in and  respectively 
in  we became the sole supplier of food and consumable products to kmart corporation s more than  stores and supercenters 
we began shipments under the new ten year agreement in april  with full implementation in july sales to kmart increased to approximately billion in from billion in in january  kmart filed voluntary petitions for chapter bankruptcy 
kmart has announced that it will announce its store closure plan in march at that time  we will be able to better assess the impact on our future sales 
retail segment sales decreased in  following a decrease in the primary reasons for the decreases in both and relate to the divestiture of under performing and non strategic conventional retail stores to increase focus on our price impact retail stores partially offset by store acquisitions 
we operated  and retail stores at the end of  and  respectively 
sales in our price impact retail stores increased over in with the number of stores increasing from at the beginning of to at the end of same store sales in increased over gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales  decreased to in from in and for the decrease was primarily due to a change in mix between the distribution and retail segments 
the sales of the distribution segment represent a larger portion of total company sales in compared to and in compared to due to the continual increase in distribution sales as well as the divestiture of non strategic retail 
the distribution segment has lower margins as a percentage of sales versus the retail segment 
distribution segment gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to in from in and decreased in from in adjusted gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in and in the decrease in was primarily due to increased kmart business that is at a lower margin  and the decrease in was due primarily to increased transportation costs due to the consolidation of distribution centers 
both years decreases were partially offset by the centralization of procurement to support services 
retail segment gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in and increased in from in adjusted gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in but increased in from in the decreasing margin in reflects our transition out of conventional retail and into price impact retail  which has lower shelf prices and gross margins 
improvements in compared to were primarily due to the divesting or closing of under performing stores 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to in from in and in the decreases were due to asset rationalization  our low cost pursuit program  and centralizing administrative functions  but also due to a reduction in the volume of the retail segment 
the distribution segment has lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales versus the retail segment 
distribution segment selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in and in adjusted selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in and in the primary reasons for the decreases during these years are due to leveraging the effect of sales growth and low cost pursuit initiatives along with centralizing administrative functions to support services 
retail segment selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in and in adjusted selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in and in the decrease is primarily attributed to our shift in focus from conventional retail to price impact retail  a format that has lower operating expense levels than conventional retail 
operating earnings 
for distribution and retail segments  we measure operating earnings as sales less cost of sales less selling and administrative expenses 
the change in operating earnings is a combination of the explanations included in sales  gross margin and selling and administrative expenses described above 
operating earnings as a percentage of net sales for were  up from in and down in from in adjusted operating earnings as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in and in distribution segment operating earnings as a percentage of net sales for were  up from in and down in from in adjusted operating earnings as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in and in retail segment operating earnings as a percentage of sales for were  up from in and a loss of 
in adjusted operating earnings as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in and for interest expense 
interest expense in was million  down from million in and was up from million in the decrease in was due primarily to lower average debt balances for revolver loans and capitalized lease obligations along with lower average interest rates for revolver and term loans 
the increase in related to both higher average balances and interest rates 
the million in included million of interest expense related to the early retirement of debt in the first quarter of for  interest rate hedge agreements resulted in a million reduction of net interest expense compared to additional expense of million in and million in the company enters into interest rate swap transactions to manage our debt portfolio and interest rate risks 
see the long term debt footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these transactions 
interest income 
interest income of million in decreased from million in and million in due to reduced customer and other interest bearing receivable balances  lower interest rates and an unusual item in related to interest on refunds of federal income taxes from prior years 
the million in included million of interest income related to the early retirement of debt in the first quarter of equity investment results 
equity investment results improved to a loss of million for compared to losses of million for and million for the improvement is due to the liquidation of investments resulting in a smaller portfolio 
impairment restructuring charge credit 
the pre tax charge for our strategic plan totaled million for  million for and million for of these totals  a recovery of million in and charges of million and million in and  respectively  were reflected in the impairment restructuring charge credit line with the balance of the charges reflected in other financial statement lines 
see the impairment restructuring charge credit and related costs footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these charges 
litigation charge 
in  we recorded litigation settlements and other related pre tax expenses totaling million related to the settlement of the storehouse markets  inc  et al  don s united super  et 
al  coddington enterprises  inc  et 
al  j a foods  inc et 
al  r d foods  inc 
et 
al  and robandee united super  inc  et 
al  and other cases 
in  we recorded million of net income in settlements relating to other cases 
see item legal proceedings and the contingencies footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding these litigation charges 
taxes on income 
the effective tax rates used for  and were  and  respectively  with and representing a tax benefit 
these are blended rates taking into account operations activity  strategic plan activity  write offs of non deductible goodwill and the timing of these transactions during the year 
the effective tax rate for was high due to the impact of goodwill permanent differences from the sale of certain retail stores 
extraordinary charge 
we reflected an extraordinary after tax charge of million million pre tax in due to the early retirement of debt 
see the long term debt footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the debt retirement 
certain accounting matters 
the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
one of the provisions of this standard is to require use of a non amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and other indefinite intangibles 
under that approach  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives would not be amortized to earnings over a period of time 
instead  these amounts would be reviewed for impairment and expensed against earnings only in the periods in which the recorded values are more than implied fair value 
we are currently testing for impairment and expect to have such testing defined by the end of the first quarter of  the tests will be performed by the end of the second quarter of goodwill amortization in was million 
our estimate of the impact that goodwill amortization had on the diluted per share amount for  excluding the strategic plan charges  litigation charges  kmart credit loss and net additional interest expense due to the early retirement of debt  was per share 
the fasb emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products and eitf accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf and eitf provide guidance on income statement classification on consideration paid to a reseller of a vendor s products 
they will be implemented in the first quarter of  as required  and will provide for certain reclassifications of revenues and cost of sales within our financial statements totaling approximately million for with no effect on gross margin or earnings 
the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
we are studying the impact that sfas has on our financial statements and planning to implement it in fiscal year  as required 
the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we will implement sfas as of the beginning of fiscal year  as required 
in december  the aicpa s accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position sop  accounting by certain entities including entities with trade receivables that lend to or finance the activities of others 
the sop is effective for our fiscal year 
this sop provides guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of amounts due to us from customers included in our accounts and notes receivable 
we do not expect the adoption of these new standards to have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
the estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable 
estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  customer receivables  inventories  assets held for sale  fixed asset lives  intangible assets  income taxes  self insurance reserves  retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we have also chosen certain accounting policies when options are available  including o the last in  first out lifo method to value a majority of our inventories  and o the intrinsic value method  or apb opinion no 
 to account for our common stock incentive awards 
these accounting policies are applied consistently for all years presented 
our operating results would be affected if other alternatives were used 
information about the impact on our operating results of using lifo and apb opinion no 
is included in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  although not inclusive 
o we record estimates for certain health and welfare and workers compensation and casualty insurance costs that are self insured programs 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or costs of the medical profession increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional costs to the consolidated financial statements could be required 
o we record allowance for credit losses based on estimates of customers ability to pay and the fair value of collateral 
if the financial condition of our customers or the fair value of the collateral were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
o we record reserves for closed stores based on future lease commitments  anticipated future subleases of properties and current risk free interest rates 
if interest rates or the real estate leasing markets change  additional reserves may be required 
liquidity and capital resources in the fiscal year ended december   our principal sources of cash were cash flows from operating activities  the sale of certain assets and investments and debt offerings 
during this period  sources of long term capital  excluding shareholders equity  were borrowings under our credit facility  lessors of equipment and retail locations  and the issuance of bonds in the capital market 
on december   we had million available under the revolving portion of our credit facility and million of net working capital including million of cash and cash equivalents 
net cash provided by used in operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the same period in the use of cash in can be attributed to an increase in inventories and trade receivables as a result of growth in our distribution business 
the growth can be attributed to a long term supply agreement with kmart corporation and other new customers added during the year 
the kmart contract alone required approximately million of additional working capital investment 
the use of cash in was partially offset by lower cash payments for strategic plan expenditures of million compared to million in although the strategic plan has been completed  cash requirements for recorded liabilities will continue for the next few years as closed store leases and multi employer pension obligations are paid 
net cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in fiscal compared to million for included in the net investment expenditures were million for capital expenditures and million for acquisitions of businesses 
offsetting these expenditures in part were million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and conventional retail stores 
for fiscal  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million to maintain our distribution system  grow our price impact retail operations  and further upgrade our information technology systems 
acquisitions of supermarket groups or chains or distribution operations will be made only on a selective basis and are not necessarily included in the million estimate above 
net cash provided by used in financing activities 
for fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was million compared to a use of million in included in was a net increase in long term debt of million 
in march of  we issued million of senior notes that mature april  and million of convertible senior subordinated notes that mature march  the proceeds were used to redeem all of the notes due december and to pay down outstanding revolver loans 
also in march  we sold million of common stock in a private placement 
in october  we sold an additional million of our existing senior subordinated notes due and the proceeds were used to pay down outstanding revolver loans 
the net increase in debt can primarily be attributed to various new kmart business from the long term supply agreement and acquisitions in also in  capital lease obligations decreased million as a result of lease terminations and payments to lessors 
ebitda we generated million  million and million of adjusted ebitda for fiscal  and  respectively 
adjusted ebitda is earnings before extraordinary items  interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  equity investment results  lifo provision and unusual adjustments eg  strategic plan charges and other unusual expense or income items 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative measure of our net income  operating performance  cash flow or liquidity 
it is provided as additional information related to our ability to service debt  however  conditions may require conservation of funds for other uses 
although we believe adjusted ebitda enhances a reader s understanding of our financial condition  this measure  when viewed individually  is not necessarily a better indicator of any trend as compared to conventionally computed measures eg  net sales  net earnings  net cash flows  etc finally  amounts presented may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies 
the following table sets forth our calculation of adjusted ebitda in millions net income loss before extraordinary charge add back taxes on income loss depreciation amortization interest expense equity investment results lifo ebitda add back non cash strategic plan charges and unusual items ebitda excluding non cash strategic plan charges add back strategic plan charges and unusual items ultimately requiring cash adjusted ebitda excludes amounts already added back interest expense of million for  depreciation amortization of million for  and equity investment results of million for the adjusted ebitda amount represents cash flow from operations excluding unusual or infrequent items 
in our opinion  adjusted ebitda is the best starting point when evaluating our ability to service debt 
in addition  we believe it is important to identify the cash flows relating to unusual or infrequent charges and strategic plan charges  which should also be considered in evaluating our ability to service debt 
for fiscal  our principal sources of liquidity and capital are expected to be cash flows from operating activities  our ability to borrow under the revolving portion of our credit facility  and our ability to access the capital markets 
in addition  lease financing may be employed for new retail stores  distribution facilities and certain equipment 
management believes the sources mentioned will be adequate to meet working capital needs  capital expenditures  expenditures for acquisitions if any  strategic plan reserve payouts and other capital needs for the remainder of fiscal contractual obligations and commitments 
we enter into certain obligations in the normal course of business with contractual future cash payments as summarized below payments due in fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal there after total in millions long term debt  capital lease obligations operating leases closed store reserves pension withdrawals litigation settlement payout see long term debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
see lease agreements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
see impairment restructuring charge credit and related costs in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
includes contingency reserves with payments estimated 
we are also contingently committed to certain off balance sheet obligations in the normal course of business with future expirations as summarized below commitments expire in fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal there after total in millions letters of credit loan guarantees lease guarantees most of our letters of credit guarantee self insurance reserves 
to the extent a change of control would occur  we could be required to pay significant amounts to current management in connection with change in control agreements 
risk factors there are many factors that affect our business and results of operations 
the following is a description of some of the important factors that may cause actual results of our operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired 
we have a substantial amount of debt and debt service obligations  which could adversely affect our financial health 
we have a substantial amount of debt outstanding 
the following chart shows certain important credit statistics as of december  total debt including capital leases  million shareholders equity million total capitalization  million debt to capitalization our debt could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could o make it more difficult to satisfy our long term debt obligations  o require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our debt  o increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  o limit our ability to fund future working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements  o limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and o limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds 
our subsidiaries and we may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future  including secured debt 
the terms of the indentures governing our outstanding debt do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so 
as of december   our credit facility permitted additional borrowings of up to million 
if new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries current debt levels  the related risks that we and they now face could intensify 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will depend on our financial and operating performance  which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we may be materially adversely affected by the bankruptcy of kmart corporation 
kmart corporation is our largest customer  accounting for of our net sales in on january   kmart and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
shortly thereafter  kmart and fleming entered into a critical vendor agreement under the terms of which kmart paid us million and we agreed to supply kmart for two years 
we will assert a prepetition claim in the bankruptcy proceeding for obligations under our ten year distribution agreement 
a material portion of this claim may not be paid by kmart 
the terms of our distribution agreement provide that kmart can terminate if  among other things  the volume of kmart s purchases decline by certain amounts  if we materially breach our obligations  including a failure to maintain specified service levels  or if we experience certain types of changes of control 
kmart can also elect to terminate the distribution agreement on months written notice given after the fifth anniversary of its effective date  with the termination to take place at the end of a transition period of up to an additional months at kmart s discretion 
subject to the effect of the critical vendor agreement  kmart has the right to assume or reject the distribution agreement with us 
if kmart rejects it  a breach by kmart will result  effective immediately prior to the bankruptcy filing date  but we may still have to supply kmart for a month transition period 
if kmart assumes the distribution agreement  it would be required to cure all defaults  including payment of our prepetition claim 
because kmart is a substantial portion of our business  negative information about kmart s performance  financial condition  business prospects and progress through its bankruptcy may adversely affect the market and prices of our securities 
we cannot predict at this date what affect this bankruptcy will have on us  but if kmart chooses to close a large number of its stores  our sales and earnings could be materially adversely affected 
further  a failure by kmart to successfully reorganize or to continue as a going concern would have a material adverse effect on us 
also  although no material litigation is currently outstanding  we may be involved in litigation related to the kmart bankruptcy  including litigation with vendors from whom we ordered product 
the indentures governing our publicly traded notes  our credit facility and our other existing indebtedness contain provisions that could materially restrict our business 
the indentures governing our publicly traded notes  our credit facility and our other existing indebtedness contain a number of significant covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to o dispose of assets  o incur additional debt  o guarantee third party obligations  o repay other debt or amend other debt instruments  o create liens on assets  o enter into capital leases  o make investments  loans or advances  o make acquisitions or engage in mergers or consolidations  o make capital expenditures  and o engage in certain transactions with our subsidiaries and affiliates 
under our credit facility and indentures  we are required to meet a number of financial ratios and tests 
if we fail to achieve a ratio or test  it could result in an event of default and cause a cross default under additional documents governing our other existing indebtedness 
such a default would permit our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed thereunder to be due and payable  together with accrued and unpaid interest  and our senior lenders could terminate their commitments to make further extensions of credit under our credit facility 
if we were unable to repay debt to our secured lenders  they could proceed against the collateral securing the debt 
if the customers to whom we lend money or sublease real property or for whom we guarantee store lease obligations fail to repay us  it could harm our financial condition 
we provide subleases  extend loans to and make investments in many of our retail store customers  often in conjunction with the establishment of long term supply contracts 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million in outstanding loans to our customers 
our loans to our customers are not investment grade and are highly illiquid 
we also have investments in customers through direct financing leases of real property and equipment  lease guarantees  operating leases or credit extensions for inventory purchases 
although we have credit policies and apply cost benefit analyses to these investment decisions  we face the risk that credit losses from existing or future investments or commitments could adversely affect our financial condition 
our credit loss expense from receivables as well as from investments in customers was million in including a million charge related to the kmart bankruptcy and million in various changes in the distribution and retail markets in which we operate have led and may continue to lead to reduced sales and margins and lower profitability for our customers and  consequently  for us 
the distribution and retail markets in which we operate are undergoing accelerated change as distributors and retailers seek to lower costs and provide additional services in an increasingly competitive environment 
an example of this is the growing trend of large self distributing chains consolidating to reduce costs and gain efficiencies 
eating away from home and alternative format food stores  such as warehouse stores and supercenters  have taken market share from traditional supermarket operators  including independent grocers  many of whom are our customers 
vendors  seeking to ensure that more of their promotional fees and allowances are used by retailers to increase sales volume  increasingly direct promotional dollars to large self distributing chains 
we believe that these changes have led to reduced sales  reduced margins and lower profitability among many of our customers and  consequently  for us 
if the strategies we have developed in response to these changing market conditions are not successful  it could harm our financial condition and business prospects 
consumable goods distribution is a low margin business and is sensitive to economic conditions 
we derive most of our revenues from the consumable goods distribution industry 
this industry is characterized by a high volume of sales with relatively low profit margins 
significant portions of our sales are at prices that are based on product cost plus a percentage markup 
consequently  our results of operations may be negatively impacted when consumable goods prices go down  even though our percentage markup may remain constant 
the consumable goods industry is also sensitive to national and regional economic conditions  and the demand for our consumable goods has been adversely affected from time to time by economic downturns 
additionally  our distribution business is sensitive to increases in fuel and other transportation related costs 
we face intense competition in both our distribution and retail markets  and if we are unable to compete effectively in these markets  it could harm our business 
our distribution group operates in a highly competitive market 
we face competition from local  regional and national food distributors on the basis of price  quality and assortment  schedules and reliability of deliveries and the range and quality of services provided 
we also compete with retail supermarket chains that self distribute  purchasing directly from vendors and distributing products to their supermarkets for sale to the consumer 
consolidation of self distributing chains may produce even stronger competition for our distribution group 
our retail group competes with other food outlets on the basis of price  quality and assortment  store location and format  sales promotions  advertising  availability of parking  hours of operation and store appeal 
traditional mass merchandisers have gained a growing foothold in food marketing and distribution with alternative store formats  such as warehouse stores and supercenters  which depend on concentrated buying power and low cost distribution technology 
we expect that stores with alternative formats will continue to increase their market share in the future 
retail consolidations not only produce stronger competition for our retail group  but may also result in declining sales in our distribution group if our existing customers are acquired by self distributing chains or if self distributing chains are otherwise able to increase their market share 
some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do 
in addition  consolidation in the industry  heightened competition among our vendors  new entrants and trends toward vertical integration could create additional competitive pressures that reduce our margins and adversely affect our business 
if we fail to successfully respond to these competitive pressures or to implement our strategies effectively  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business prospects 
because we own and operate real estate  we face the risk of being held liable for environmental damages that may occur on our properties 
our facilities and operations are subject to various laws  regulations and judicial and administrative orders concerning protection of the environment and human health  including provisions regarding the transportation  storage  distribution  disposal or discharge of certain materials 
in conformity with these provisions  we have a comprehensive program for testing  removal  and replacement or repair of our underground fuel storage tanks and for site remediation where necessary 
although we have established reserves that we believe will be sufficient to satisfy the anticipated costs of all known remediation requirements  we cannot assure you that these reserves will be sufficient 
we and others have been designated by the us environmental protection agency and by similar state agencies as potentially responsible parties under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  or cercla  or similar state laws  as applicable  with respect to epa designated superfund sites 
while liability under cercla for remediation at these sites is generally joint and several with other responsible parties  we believe that  to the extent we are ultimately determined to be liable for the expense of remediation at any site  such liability will not result in a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we are committed to maintaining the environment and protecting natural resources and human health and to achieving full compliance with all applicable laws  regulations and orders 
various legal actions  governmental investigations and proceedings and claims are pending or threatened or may be asserted in the future against us 
we are a party to or threatened with various legal proceedings  claims and contingent loss situations arising in the ordinary course of our business including o disputes with customers and vendors  o disputes with owners or creditors of financially troubled or failed customers  o disputes with employees regarding labor conditions  wages  workers compensation matters and alleged discriminatory practices  o disputes with insurance carriers  o disputes with landlords and lessees  and o disputes with tax authorities  some of which may be for substantial amounts 
we will incur the costs of defending such legal proceedings and claims whether or not they have merit 
we intend to vigorously defend against all lawsuits  but we cannot predict the outcome of any case 
an unfavorable outcome in any case could be expensive and harm our business and financial condition 
because we sell food and other products  we are subject to product liability claims 
like any other seller of food and other products  we face the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that people who purchase products we sell become injured or experience illness as a result 
we believe that we have sufficient primary and excess umbrella liability insurance to protect us against any product liability claims that may arise 
however  this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost  or  even if it is available  it may not be adequate to cover our liabilities 
we generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying our products  but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited  as a practical matter  to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the policy limits of any insurance provided by suppliers 
if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification to cover our liabilities  product liability claims relating to defective food and other products could materially reduce our earnings 
our current strategy involves growth through acquisitions  which requires us to incur substantial costs and potential liabilities for which we may never realize the anticipated benefits 
part of our growth strategy for our retail group involves selective strategic acquisitions of stores operated by others 
in addition  our distribution group intends to seek strategic acquisitions of other distribution centers on a limited basis 
since the beginning of  we have acquired several different businesses 
in april  we acquired minter weisman co  a wholesale distribution company serving over convenience stores in minnesota  wisconsin and surrounding states 
in april  we also purchased seven food less stores located in central california from whitco foods  inc which we continue to operate as price impact stores under the food less banner 
during august  we facilitated the third party purchase of stores located in new mexico and texas from furrs supermarkets  most of which were purchased by fleming supplied independent operators 
in september  we purchased five smith s food drug stores located in new mexico and texas from kroger co 
which we operate under our price impact format 
also in september  we purchased certain assets and inventory of miller hartman south  llc  a wholesale distributor serving over  convenience stores in kentucky and surrounding states 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to implement our growth strategy  or that this strategy will ultimately be successful 
we regularly engage in evaluations of potential acquisitions and are in various stages of discussion regarding possible acquisitions  certain of which  if consummated  could be significant to us 
any potential acquisitions may result in significant transaction expenses  increased interest and amortization expense  increased depreciation expense and increased operating expense  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
achieving the benefits of these acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to integrate those businesses with our business in an efficient manner 
we cannot assure you that this will happen or that it will happen in an efficient manner 
our consolidation of operations following these acquisitions may require substantial attention from our management 
the diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve expected net sales  operating expenses and operating results for these acquired businesses 
we cannot assure you that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits of any acquisition  and if we fail to realize these anticipated benefits  our operating performance could suffer 
furthermore  we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates  obtain acceptable financing or consummate any new acquisitions 
we operate in a competitive labor market  and a substantial number of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
our continued success will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in both our distribution and retail groups 
we compete with other businesses in our markets with respect to attracting and retaining qualified employees 
a shortage of qualified employees would require us to enhance our wage and benefits packages in order to compete effectively in the hiring and retention of qualified employees or to hire more expensive temporary employees 
in addition  about of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements  most of which expire at various times over the course of the next five years 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew our collective bargaining agreements  that our labor costs will not increase  that we will be able to recover any increases through increased prices charged to customers or that we will not suffer business interruptions as a result of strikes or other work stoppages 
if we fail to attract and retain qualified employees  to control our labor costs  or to recover any increased labor costs through increased prices charged to our customers  it could harm our business 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the markets on which the notes trade  the markets in which we operate  our operations and our profitability 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and your investment 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or us businesses 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers 
furthermore  these attacks may make travel and the transportation of our supplies and products more difficult and more expensive and ultimately affect our sales 
also as a result of terrorism  the united states has entered into an armed conflict which could have a further impact on our sales  our supply chain  and our ability to deliver product to our customers 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business 
the consequences of any of these armed conflicts are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business or your investment 
more generally  any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states and worldwide financial markets and economy 
they also could result in economic recession in the united states or abroad 
any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our operating results  revenues and costs and may result in the volatility of the market price for our securities and on the future price of our securities
