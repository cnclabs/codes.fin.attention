item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained in item of this report 
recent developments on december   we entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement the purchase agreement to acquire certain assets and intellectual property relating to the former l h entities that were in bankruptcy under the jurisdiction of both the us bankruptcy courts for the district of delaware and the belgium court of ieper 
we purchased these assets in a closed auction proceeding administered by the creditor committee of the former entities and approved by both the us and belgium courts on december  the transaction was completed on december  pursuant to the purchase agreement  we acquired certain of the speech and language technology assets of l h including patent and trade mark portfolios  core technology  and completed technology as well as certain accounts receivable and fixed assets 
we paid million in total consideration to the creditors as follows million in cash  we issued million shares of stock valued at million based on the average of the closing share price of our stock days before and after the deal was announced and issued a promissory note in the principal amount of million  to be repaid in installments of million of principal and interest due and payable on the fifteenth th of each march  june  september and december commencing on march   for a total of eleven payments 
all remaining principal and interest shall become due on december  in connection with the acquisition  we assumed certain liabilities including liabilities for products which were sold prior to the acquisition date and which are expected to be upgraded with newer versions in and liabilities for development contracts with customers 
the actual amount of the liabilities may differ from the estimated amounts 
differences between the actual and estimated amounts will be recorded as an adjustment to the liability 
on december   we filed a current report on form k with the sec to report our acquisition of certain assets of the speech and language technologies of lernout hauspie 
we accounted for the transaction as an acquisition of assets 
in connection with the k filing  we sought the concurrence of the sec staff with respect to our accounting for this transaction as an acquisition of assets 
we have had ongoing discussions with the sec staff since that time 
the most recent communication with the sec staff indicated that they would ordinarily conclude that an acquisition of this type would be considered an acquisition of a business rather than as an acquisition of assets  but the sec staff said they would consider the matter further upon us furnishing additional information on the transaction 
we are actively preparing a response to this request 
if we were required to change the method of accounting for this transaction  the change would not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
the impact on  as reported  would be as follows i a reduction of amortization expense of approximately million  ii a reduction in identifiable tangible and intangible assets of approximately million  iii increase in goodwill in the amount of approximately million  iv no change to net revenues or net loss per share  and v a decrease in our net loss of approximately million 
additionally  the impact to would be a benefit of approximately million of reduced amortization expense per quarter 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was released by the securities and exchange commission  or sec  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report contains a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by us 
in addition  financial reporting release no 
was recently released by the sec to require all companies to include a discussion to address  among other things  liquidity  off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions included in the financial statements are revenue recognition  estimating valuation allowances specifically sales returns and other allowances  the recoverability of intangible assets including goodwill and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive our revenues from sales of our software products to end users through distribution partners and value added resellers var s  royalty revenues from oem partners  license fees from sales of our products to end users and from services  primarily maintenance associated with software license transactions 
we apply the provisions of statement of position software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions to all transactions involving the sale of software products 
in addition  we apply the provisions of staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition 
sales of our software products through distribution partners and var s provide certain rights of return 
as a result  we make estimates of potential future product returns related to products sold to distributors 
our estimates of sales returns and allowance reserves are based on inventory levels at distributors and var s as well as historical returns  current economic trends  and obsolescence based on new product introductions 
additionally  from time to time we offer price protection or rebates to certain of our customers 
we estimate the amount of the price protection and rebate offers at the later of the sale or time the offer is made 
the judgments made and estimates used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances may be material in any accounting period 
if actual returns or acceptance of other offers differ significantly from those estimates  such differences may have a material impact on the results of operations for the period in which the actual returns or acceptance of other offers become known 
the provision for sales returns and other allowances amounted to million at december  similarly  we must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivables 
we specifically analyze accounts receivables and analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts risk 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of sales return and other allowances of million and allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  royalty revenues derived from sales to certain oem partners are based on estimates of additional deployments of the licenses by the customer in the most recent reporting period 
if actual additional licenses differ significantly from estimates made based on historical experience  such differences may have a material impact on the results of operations for the period in which the actual licenses deployed become known 
if our experience changes dramatically due to changes in the market  changes in our customer base  seasonality or other economic factors  our ability to make such estimates may be impacted and therefore we may be unable to recognize revenue until these rights lapse or until we receive royalty payments 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets  which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions 
the most significant long lived and intangible assets are patents  core technology  developed technology  and goodwill 
the values of these assets were determined by a risk adjusted  discounted cash flow approach 
we assess the potential impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
future adverse changes in these or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge that would impact future results of operations and financial position 
determining deferred tax valuation allowances we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
while we have considered our ability to generate future taxable income in assessing the need for the allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
additionally  we have significant net operating loss carryforwards nols that we have generated or acquired as part of past business combinations 
our ability to fully utilize these nol s is based on a number of factors including ownership changes resulting from the issuance of or other changes in the ownership of our equity securities 
existing and future ownership changes could decrease our ability to fully utilize these nol s therefore increasing our tax provision in the period such determination was made 
results of operations the following table presents  as a percentage of total revenue  certain selected financial data for each of the three years in the period ended december year ended december  net revenue costs and expenses cost of revenue research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets restructuring and other charges  net total costs and expenses loss from operations other income expense  net loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net loss see note of notes to consolidated financial statements revenue year ended december  compared to december  net revenue of million for increased by million or from the comparable period in the increase in revenue was due to the release of upgrades to products in our digital imaging product line which resulted in increased unit sales as well as slightly higher average selling prices associated with the upgraded products 
in addition we generated revenue from a significant contract with an oem customer 
the increase in revenue came primarily from our ocr product family  which increased by approximately million from the comparable period in the additional revenue growth of million came primarily from our other flagship products electronic forms  paper management and development kit products 
late in the fourth quarter we released omniform premium and omniform and during the third quarter we released paperport deluxe  which also contributed to the revenue growth of the paper management family of products 
we also benefited to a smaller degree from speech and language product revenues from our acquisition of the realspeak and dragon speech and language products from l h on december  we expect that speech and language product revenues will increase as a percentage of net revenue in future periods as we integrate the assets from the l h acquisition into our business 
geographically  north america accounted for of revenue and europe accounted for versus and  respectively  for the comparable period in the increase in europe in was associated with the release of the international language versions of omnipage and paperport during the second half of international revenue continues to grow as a percentage of net revenue 
we anticipate international revenue to be approximately to of revenue in compared to of revenue in the breakdown of net revenue for was var retail  direct  oem  and corporate 
the breakdown of net revenue for the same period in was var retail  direct  oem  and corporate 
we expect the revenue mix for to shift to a higher concentration of corporate business offset by a reduction in retail business 
we expect oem and direct to remain consistent with levels as a percentage of revenue 
during  ingram micro  a retail distributor  accounted for of our net revenue  digital river our direct fulfillment partner  accounted for of our net revenue  and xerox  a significant shareholder  related party and oem customer  accounted for of our net revenue 
during  ingram micro accounted for of our net revenue  digital river accounted for of our net revenue  and xerox  accounted for of our net revenue 
with the addition of the speech and language products from the l h acquisition in december  we expect to increase our var retail  re seller and oem product offerings and revenues substantially in the introduction of major new software products and enhancements of existing products  as well as potential oem agreements  are expected to have a significant impact on our quarterly and annual revenue 
as is characteristic of the initial stages of personal computer product life cycles  we expect that sales volumes of any new software product may increase in the first few months following introduction 
thereafter  revenue may stabilize or decline until the end of a product life cycle  at which time revenue may decline significantly  as a result of unit sales and price reductions 
due to the inherent uncertainties of product development and new product introductions  we cannot with certainty predict the exact date in which a new product or version will be ready to ship 
any delay in the scheduled release of major new products would have a material adverse impact on our total net revenues and operating results 
year ended december  compared to december  total revenue of million for increased compared to of million 
the increase in absolute dollars is primarily a result of a broader product line due to the acquisition of caere on march  during product sales through direct channels  including the web sites of some of our oem customers  online stores and our own web store accounted for million  or of our revenue  compared to of revenue in during  ingram micro  a retail distributor  accounted for of our net revenue  digital river  our direct fulfillment partner  accounted for of our net revenue  and xerox  an oem customer  accounted for of our net revenue 
in  ingram micro accounted for of our revenue  tech data accounted for  and xerox accounted for 
revenue derived outside of north america  primarily in europe  was approximately and of total revenue in and  respectively 
international revenue in of million  increased by million from due primarily to the acquisition of caere in march since international sales have been denominated primarily in local currencies and these sales are subject to a number of risks inherent in doing business on an international level  such as unexpected fluctuations in currency exchange rates  regulatory requirements  import and export duties and restrictions  and the logistical difficulties of managing multinational operations  any of which could adversely impact the success of our international operations 
the growth of our international business will depend  in part  on our ability to increase awareness of our products in international markets 
see item business marketing  sales and distribution 
cost of revenue year ended december  compared to december  cost of revenue consists primarily of material costs  third party royalties  fulfillment  and salaries for product support personnel and related costs associated with contracts  which are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
currently our software products are manufactured by globalware solutions on a worldwide basis  which also packages and ships the majority of our products to customers 
see item business manufacturing 
cost of revenue in was million or of revenue  compared to million or of revenue in the comparable period of the decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue from the comparable period in is directly attributed to the consolidation of our worldwide manufacturing fulfillment activities and cost savings initiatives we introduced in the second quarter of this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the cost of revenue in the second half of  as a result of costs associated with engineering efforts under a significant oem contract 
we anticipate that cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue will decrease slightly in due to higher revenues over a relatively fixed cost base for certain manufacturing costs  a pay for support program implemented in january  and renegotiations with our fulfillment partner and certain third party royalty contracts 
year ended december  compared to december  cost of revenue increased to million or of revenue in compared to million or of revenue in the increase in absolute dollars and percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the caere business in march  which resulted in multiple manufacturing providers  which reduced efficiencies and increased costs 
by the end of  the company consolidated its manufacturing providers 
research and development expenses year ended december  compared to december  research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits costs of engineers 
research and development costs were million or of revenue in  compared to million or of revenue in the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue is a result of certain expenses associated with oem engineering efforts being charged to cost of revenues as well as increased revenues compared to the prior period 
we anticipate that research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue will increase in to approximately to of revenue 
the expected increase is based upon the increased headcount and costs associated with the l h acquisition on december  we increased research and development headcount by approximately employees in connection with the l h acquisition 
this compares to headcount of prior to the l h acquisition 
we believe that the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products are essential to our success 
accordingly  we will continue to invest in research and development activities 
to date  we have not capitalized any development costs as the cost incurred after technological feasibility but before release of product is not significant 
we will continue to monitor this policy as we develop new or upgraded products 
year ended december  compared to december  research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit costs of engineers 
research and development costs were million or of revenue in  an increase of million from the million or of revenue reported in the increase in research and development spending is due to the added software engineering headcount from the acquisition of caere on march  offset by the cost reduction actions in the second half of selling  general and administrative expenses year ended december  compared to december  selling expenses include salaries  commissions  advertising  direct mail  public relations  trade shows  travel and other related sales and marketing expenses 
general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for administration  finance  human resources  information systems  and general management in addition to legal and accounting expenses and other professional services 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of revenue in compared to million or of revenue for the same period in the absolute dollar decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses from the same period in was a result of cost reduction efforts undertaken during the first and second quarters of additionally  we realized a gain of approximately million primarily due to the favorable settlement of investment banking fees associated with the caere acquisition 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from the same period in is a result of the decreased expenses as noted above  the realized gain and increased revenues compared to the prior period 
we anticipate that selling general and administrative expenses for will decrease to approximately of revenue 
this expected decrease is projected based on revenue growth while controlling costs 
we increased selling general and administrative headcount by approximately employees in connection with the l h acquisition 
this compares to headcount of prior to the l h acquisition during we will continue to attempt to control selling  general and administrative expenses 
however  if revenue continues to grow  in order to support our growing operations  selling  general and administrative expenses will increase 
in addition  we may choose to increase general and administrative expenses in advance of revenue in order to support expected future revenue growth in specific product lines or geographical regions of the world 
such expenses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on a variety of factors  including the timing of the introduction of new products  expansion of our distribution channels  general advertising not related to product introductions and expansion into international markets 
year ended december  compared to december  selling  general and administrative expenses in were million or of revenue  an increase of million from the million or of revenue reported in the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses from to  was due primarily to the acquisition of caere on march   offset by cost reduction efforts in the second half of described further below 
amortization of intangible assets and acquired in process research and development amortization of intangible assets for was million compared to million for the same period in the increase in amortization of intangible assets of million compared to the same period in  resulted from a full months of amortization for the caere acquisition being taken during versus approximately nine months in due to the timing of the caere acquisition which was completed on march  in connection with the caere acquisition  million was charged to operations upon consummation of the acquisition  which represented acquired in process research and development on development projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
amortization expense associated with the l h asset acquisition included in the results of operations amounted to million for the year ended december  as a result of the second quarter restructuring actions described below  certain intangible assets associated with the caere acquisition were impaired 
accordingly  the company wrote off million of net intangible assets including the acquired workforce amounting to million and a favorable building lease amounting to million 
the in process research and development charge of million for  reflects that portion of the purchase price of scansoft representing acquired in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  this amount was immediately charged to expense in the consolidated statements of income upon consummation of the acquisition 
we will adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets on january  and we will cease amortizing goodwill  which amounted to million in we will also reclassify approximately million of previously recognized acquired workforce to goodwill and as a result  amortization on this amount will also cease 
the workforce recorded in connection with the l h acquisition is not subject to the provisions of sfas as the transaction  for financial accounting purposes  was recorded as an asset purchase and not a business combination 
sfas also requires us to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test with in six months from the date of adoption 
we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge on the million of goodwill at december   upon completion of the initial impairment review 
the decrease in amortization expense from the goodwill will be partly offset in by the amortization of intangible assets acquired from l h of approximately million per year 
we estimate that amortization expense for related to the l h acquisition will be approximately million 
restructuring and other charges in connection with the acquisition of caere in the first quarter of  scansoft identified employees of caere whose positions were eliminated upon consummation of the acquisition 
these positions included in research and development  in general and administrative functions  and in sales and marketing 
additionally  the caere president and ceo position was eliminated 
as a result  we established  as part of the purchase price allocation  a restructuring reserve of million for severance payments to employees  and a restructuring reserve of million for severance to the caere former president and ceo  the payments of which will continue through march in june  we implemented a restructuring plan to strategically refocus our business and bring operating expenses in line with net revenues 
as a result  we eliminated employee positions including in research and development  in general and administrative functions and in support and marketing 
we recorded a restructuring charge in the amount of  for severance payments to these employees and a restructuring charge of million for certain termination fees to be incurred as a result of exiting the los gatos facility 
additionally  we wrote off million of net intangible assets acquired as part of the caere acquisition including the acquired work force of million and the favorable building lease of million  which were impaired as a result of the restructuring action 
at the time of the restructuring  management expected these restructuring actions to reduce operating expenses by approximately million on an annualized basis 
annualized cost savings realized from these actions amounted to million 
for the years ended december  and  we paid million and million  respectively in severance payments related to these restructuring actions 
the remaining severance balance of million primarily relates to severance for the former caere president and ceo and will be paid through march restructuring charges of  in the first nine months of relate to the acquisition of scansoft  and the subsequent consolidation of research and development operations and the move of our headquarters to massachusetts  which resulted in the termination of employees in california 
the major components of these costs were approximately  in severance costs for the employees and approximately  for disposed west coast equipment 
these costs also included  in non refundable commitments associated with the west coast development team  as well as  in other exit costs 
all such costs were paid in gain on sale of the hardware business in the quarter ended march   we sold our hardware business to primax electronics  ltd  for approximately million and reported an operating gain of approximately million 
other income expense other income expense  net consists primarily of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments offset by interest incurred for borrowings under credit facilities and short term notes  and exchange gains and losses 
interest income consists primarily of interest earned on cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest income was million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income from to  was a result of significantly higher cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  which were generated from operations 
the decrease in interest income from to was a result of smaller invested cash balances and higher bank borrowings 
interest expense consists of interest incurred for borrowings under credit facilities and short term notes 
interest expense was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense from to resulted from the repayment of all bank borrowings under the bank credit facility during may the increase in interest expense from to resulted from increased bank borrowings under the bank credit facility 
other expense in consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses realized upon foreign exchange transactions being settled and the write off of an investment of million recorded under the cost method  which was deemed to be impaired 
income taxes at december  and  we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively of which approximately million and million  respectively  relate to tax deductions from stock compensation 
the tax benefit related to the stock compensation  when realized  will be accounted for as additional paid in capital rather than as a reduction of the provision for income tax 
at december  we had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million and million respectively 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates through  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
tax benefit of million for the year ended december   reflects a reduction of approximately million in amounts accrued for income taxes upon favorable completion of a state tax audit of caere for and this benefit was offset by tax provision for foreign and state jurisdictions for which net operating losses were limited or no net operating loss carryforwards were available 
this compares to tax provisions of million for the year ended december   which related to foreign and state income taxes 
at december  and  we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  of which approximately million and million  respectively  related to tax deductions from stock compensation 
the tax benefit related to the stock compensation benefit  when realized  will be accounted for as an addition to paid in capital rather than as a reduction of the provision for income tax 
research and development credit carryforwards as of december  and were million for both years 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
as a result of the new stock issued in conjunction with the acquisition of caere and the merger with scansoft  we are not certain whether we will be able to utilize our net operating loss and credit carryforwards without limitations 
tax provisions of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  represent taxes for foreign and state jurisdictions in which the company does business and for which no net operating loss carryforwards were available 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and net working capital of million  as compared to million in cash and short term investments and a net working capital deficit of million as of december  we generated million of cash from our operating activities for  as compared to cash used for operations of million for the same period in the cash generated from operations in came primarily from the results of operations  collection of amounts due for long term contracts included in deferred revenue and decreased accounts receivables at the end of the quarter  which was offset by lower accounts payable and accrued expense balances 
cash used in investing activities for was million as compared to million cash provided for the same period in cash used consisted of million for the l h acquisition on december  and million for property and equipment acquired  which was offset by proceeds of million from the sale of property and equipment during the comparable period in included proceeds of million of cash acquired in connection with the caere acquisition  which was offset by the acquisition of million capital equipment in the normal course of operations 
cash provided by financing activities for was million as compared to million provided from financing activities in we received net proceeds of million from the state of wisconsin investment board in exchange for million shares of common stock 
additionally  we repaid the outstanding balance of million on our bank line of credit  which was then terminated 
during the year ended december   we acquired approximately  shares of the company s common stock for million 
the buy back was part of a previously announced program to acquire up to million shares of our stock on the open market 
cash provided by financing activities for of million was comprised primarily of proceeds of million from our line of credit and million of stock option exercise proceeds  which was offset by the payment of million of notes payable 
our principal sources of liquidity as of december  consisted of approximately million of cash and cash equivalents 
we generated million of cash from operations for and had a cash balance of million at december  our cash balance reflects lower operating expenses as a result of restructuring actions and other cost reduction initiatives taken in fiscal  higher revenues compared to fiscal and equity financings net of cash paid for the l h acquisition 
we expect that operating expenses will increase in as a result of the l h acquisition 
while we also believe our revenues will increase and therefore our cash flows from operations  cash generated from operations could be negatively impacted if our products are not accepted in the markets in which we do business  by seasonality of customer buying patterns or by a continued or worsened economic downturn in the united states or international markets where our products are sold 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to generate cash from operations or secure additional equity financing if required 
we have sustained recurring losses and have an accumulated deficit at december  we believe that operating expense levels in combination with expected future revenues will continue to generate positive cash flows from operations 
we also believe that  should we experience any of the aforementioned factors  we have the ability to reduce operating expenses to levels commensurate with revenues to maintain positive cash flows from operations 
therefore  we believe that cash flows from future operations in addition to cash on hand will be sufficient to meet the our working capital  investing  financing and contractual obligations as they become due  including stock repurchase programs and potential business or asset acquisitions  for the foreseeable future 
the following table outlines our contractual payment obligations  including amounts due to the former caere president and ceo under the settlement in payments due by period within within contractual obligations total year years thereafter in thousands long term debt including interest   operating leases     caere acquisition related costs    total contractual cash obligations     in connection with the caere acquisition  we entered into a non competition and consulting agreement with the former caere president and ceo 
under the terms of the agreement  we agreed to pay the former caere president and ceo on the second anniversary of the merger  march   in cash  the difference between and the closing price per share of scansoft common stock at that time  multiplied by  during  we negotiated a termination agreement with the former caere president and ceo 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid million in cash immediately  with the remainder payable in equal quarterly installments of approximately million over the next two years 
the total consideration of this agreement was accounted for in the original caere purchase price and the termination agreement will have no effect the results of operations in in addition  unexercised options to purchase  shares that were assumed as part of the caere acquisition were canceled effective march  we have not entered into any arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated entities or other persons that would require the disclosure of off balance sheet arrangements 
as of december  no such arrangements existed 
foreign operations we develop and sell our products throughout the world 
as a result of the caere acquisition  in march and the l h acquisition in december  we significantly increased our presence in europe and added operations in asia 
with our increased international presence in a number of geographic locations and with international revenues projected to increase to to of revenue in  we are exposed to changes in foreign currencies including the euro  japanese yen and the hungarian forint 
changes in the value of the euro or other foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar could adversely affect future revenues and operating results 
we do not generally hedge any of our foreign currency denominated transactions 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations and no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets  including how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized 
in addition  sfas includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangible assets  such as acquired workforce  into goodwill 
sfas provides that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives not be amortized but rather be tested at least annually for impairment  intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas also provides specific guidance for testing goodwill for impairment 
in accordance with its provisions  we will adopt sfas on january  and we will cease amortizing goodwill  we had previously been recording annual goodwill amortization of approximately million 
we will also reclassify approximately million of previously recognized acquired workforce to goodwill and as a result  amortization on this amount has also ceased 
the workforce recorded in connection with the l h acquisition is not subject to the provisions of sfas as the transaction  for financial accounting purposes  was recorded as an asset purchase and not a business combination 
sfas also requires us to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test within six months from the date of adoption 
we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge on the million of goodwill at december   upon completion of the initial impairment review 
the decrease in amortization expense from the goodwill will be partly offset in by the amortization of intangible assets acquired from l h of approximately million per year 
we estimate amortization expense for to be approximately million 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
the objectives of sfas are to address significant issues relating to the implementation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  and to develop a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
sfas supersedes sfas  however  it retains the fundamental provisions of sfas for the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and the measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb  for segments of a business to be disposed of 
however  sfas retains the requirement of apb that entities report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting requirement to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
sfas also amends the guidance of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a temporarily controlled subsidiary 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods  and  generally  its provisions are to be applied prospectively 
we expect that the initial application of sfas will not have a material impact on our results of operations 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf  a committee of the fasb  reached a consensus on eitf issue  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products eitf 
eitf presumes that consideration from a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products is a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor s products and  therefore  should be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendor s income statement and could lead to negative revenue under certain circumstances 
revenue reduction is required unless consideration relates to a separate identifiable benefit and the benefit s fair value can be established  in which case such amounts may be recorded as operating expenses 
in accordance with its provisions  we will adopt eitf on january  eitf requires companies to apply the provisions to prior years reported in comparative financial statements in the year of adoption 
certain of our co operative marketing and marketing development fund programs do not meet the criteria to be recorded as operating expenses  which is our current policy 
unless we are able to renegotiate or otherwise change these marketing programs with our retailers  amounts earned by the retailers under such programs will be recorded as revenue reductions in the future 
upon adoption  we will reclassify all prior period reported results of operations to conform to the presentation required by eitf we are currently assessing the impact of eitf on our historical results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop our products in the united states  belgium and hungary 
we sell our products globally  primarily through an indirect reseller channel 
as a result  our financial results are affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates and weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
we collect a portion of our revenue and pay a portion of our operating expenses in foreign currencies 
as a result  changes in currency exchange rates from time to time may affect our operating results 
currently  we do not generally engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates  although we may do so in the future
