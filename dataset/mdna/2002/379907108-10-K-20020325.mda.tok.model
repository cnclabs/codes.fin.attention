item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of gold banc corporation  inc 
and subsidiaries the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to such consolidated financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this report 
general we provide community banking and related financial services at locations in kansas  oklahoma  florida  and missouri as of december  geographic markets include johnson county  kansas  an affluent suburb in the kansas city metropolitan area  tulsa and edmond  oklahoma  growing cities with a strong small business sector  bradenton  florida  a high growth area on the west coast of the state  and a number of smaller cities 
we have focused on growth of our banks lending and other services by cultivating relationships with small businesses and other clients 
we have expanded through a strategy of internal growth supplemented by community bank acquisitions that are believed to be accretive to earnings and stockholders equity 
we have taken steps to offer traditional and on line banking wealth and asset management and other financial services to customers of our banks 
in  we acquired one branch location of a savings institution  one technology service company  and one securities company specializing in public finance and advisory services 
during  we acquired three banks and created a financial services division

johnson county is a suburban community near kansas city 
johnson county has a more competitive banking environment than our smaller markets  but its robust economic growth has enabled gold bank to rapidly grow its loans and deposits in the county 
gold bank has six offices in growing areas of johnson county and two offices in the kansas city metropolitan area 
this presence in the kansas city area accounted for approximately of our total assets at year end we entered the tulsa  oklahoma  market in with the acquisition of citizens bank of tulsa which has subsequently been merged into gold bank oklahoma 
the tulsa location serves a rapidly growing area in southeastern tulsa  a light industrial district that is home to more than  small businesses  and is a mature residential area of tulsa 
a third office was opened in a developing residential area of south tulsa during the second quarter of we entered edmond  oklahoma city and outlying communities in central and western oklahoma with the acquisition of country banc in march country banc s two subsidiary banks  people first and american heritage  were also merged along with citizens bank of tulsa to create gold bank oklahoma 
the edmond location serves a rapidly growing area in northeastern oklahoma city and is in the process of opening a new branch in the growing corridor and residential area in northwestern oklahoma city 
gold bank oklahoma also serves a number of smaller  mature markets and rural communities in central and western oklahoma 
the gold bank oklahoma market accounted for approximately of our total assets at year end we entered the bradenton and sarasota  florida market on the highly popular and rapidly growing west coast of the state between tampa and naples with the acquisition of american bank in march the american bank acquisition provides us with a new  diversified market that has been one of the fastest growing population areas in the united states for the past ten years 
the demographics and per capita income levels are believed to be very promising for the development of our wealth and asset management services 
the american bank market accounted for approximately of our total assets at year end other local markets where we operate generally did not experience the level of growth seen in johnson county  tulsa  edmund and sarasota bradenton  but their economies were sound with a mix of services  manufacturing and agriculture related industries 
each of the local markets is generally a county seat and our banks locations serve both that city and the surrounding area 
financial services  including traditional and on line banking  brokerage  trust  mortgage and investments  are offered to current customers of our banks  either directly through representatives located in bank offices or through telecommunication links with the non bank offices 
influences on earnings our net income depends upon the combined results of operations of our banks  each of which conducts a commercial and consumer banking business by attracting deposits from the general public and deploying those funds to earning assets 
in addition  the non bank subsidiaries contribute income from management fees and commissions 
each bank s profitability depends primarily on net interest income which is interest income on interest earning assets less interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
interest earning assets include loans  investment securities and other earning assets such as federal funds sold 
interest bearing liabilities include customer deposits  time and savings deposits and other borrowings such as federal funds purchased  short term borrowings and long term debt  including junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures 
besides the balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  net interest income is affected by each bank s interest rate spread 
this spread is the difference between the bank s average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread is affected by changes in interest rates  deposit flows and loan demand  among other factors 
the levels of non interest income and non interest expense also affect our profitability 
a significant portion of our revenue is non interest income of our banks and non bank subsidiaries consisting of investment trading fees and commissions  service fees  gains on the sale of mortgage loans and investment securities  and other fees 
non interest expense consists of compensation and benefits  occupancy related expenses  deposit insurance premiums  expenses of opening bank offices  acquisition related expenses and other operating expenses 
our profitability also is affected by the effective tax rate  our banks provision for loan losses  and various non recurring items 
results of operations overview for the year ended december   we acquired a branch of a savings institution  a technology service provider  and a securities company 
the acquisitions were accounted for as purchase transactions 
total consideration paid for the acquisitions using the purchase method was million in excess of various assets included in the purchase 
for the year ended december   we acquired three bank holding companies with assets aggregating billion 
these acquisitions were accounted for as pooling of interests transactions 
net income for totaled million  or per share 
in  because of the pooling expenses for our current year acquisitions and closing of our mortgage banking subsidiary  gold banc reported a net loss of million  or per share 
net income for totaled million  or per share 
net earnings for decreased million over net earnings  excluding nonrecurring expenses 
this decrease was the result of decreased net interest income of million  increased provisions for loan losses of million  and was offset by an increase in other income of million and a decrease in non interest expense of million and a decrease of income tax expense of million 
net earnings for  excluding the nonrecurring expenses described above  increased million over net earnings  excluding nonrecurring expenses 
this increase was the result of increased net interest income of million and decreased provisions for loan losses of million  and was offset by a decrease in other income of million and an increase in non interest expense of million and a decrease of income tax expense of million

provision for loan losses an integral part of combining credit portfolios in our mergers requires converting the purchased banks credit culture and credit standards to ours 
inherent with the implementation of these processes and procedures is a potential for increased credit risk 
to prepare for this risk  we generally increase our provisions to prepare for any credit exposure 
it is anticipated  that as these merged banks adopt and implement these procedures  credit risk should decline  requiring lower provisions 
the provision for loan losses was million for compared to million for a increase 
non performing loans increased to million as of december  as compared to million at december  the increase in provision for loan loss in was the result of unexpected charge offs in our oklahoma region with smaller increases in our kansas and florida markets 
we believe that our continued analysis of the loan portfolio has identified our probable loan losses at december  and the provision for loan loss and charge offs are expected to be less in than the provision for loan losses was million for compared to million for  a decrease 
non performing loans increased to million as of december  as compared to million at december  non interest income the following table presents the components of our non interest income for the years indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands service fees    investment trading fees and commissions    net gains on sales of mortgage loans    realized gains losses on sale of securities   information technology services    trust fees    merchant fees   other income    total non interest income    non interest income as a percentage of average total assets non interest income was million for compared to million for a increase 
gain on sale of mortgage loans decreased million  or  in due to the closing of the mortgage operations in non interest income was million for compared to million for a decrease 
investment trading fees and commissions increased from million to million which reflects increased volume of the company s brokerage operation and was also impacted by the acquisition of ott financial 
information technology service income increased from million to million which was primarily attributable to sales generated through the acquisition of ipi 
non interest expense the following table presents the components of non interest expense for the years indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands salaries and employee benefits    information technology services cost of sales    net occupancy expense    depreciation expense    goodwill amortization expense    consolidation repositioning pooling expense    professional services    data processing expense    advertising    postage    supplies    telephone   other    total non interest expense    efficiency ratio total non interest expense was million for compared to million for  a decrease 
salaries and employee benefits increased million while occupancy expenses decreased million 
information technology services cost of sales increased from million to million due to cost of sales incurred with the increased sales of information technology services from million to million 
these additional sales and the related cost of sales were primarily the result of additional activity from the acquisition of ipi 
other non interest expense was lower in primarily because consolidation repositioning pooling mortgage subsidiary closing expenses were million in and a negative million in we recorded a recovery related to the regional arbitration settlement award of million in in this expense category 
total non interest expense was million for compared to million for a increase 
the primary reason for this increase was the increase in consolidation repositioning pooling expense from million in to million in other non interest expenses were similar in compared to income tax expense income tax expense was million for compared to million for a 
million  or  decrease 
income tax expense for was million million more than the effective tax rates for   and were   and  respectively 
the and effective tax rate differs from the expected rate of due primarily to the tax adjustments generated by the use of a capital loss carryforward in and the non deductible expenses associated with the closing of the mortgage company 
the increase in effective tax rate from is the result of certain non deductible expenses related to the closure of gold banc mortgage and non deductible pooling expenses related to the acquisitions 
asset liability management asset liability management refers to management s efforts to minimize fluctuations in net interest income caused by interest rate changes 
this is accomplished by managing the repricing of interest rate sensitive interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
an interest rate sensitive balance sheet item is one that is able to reprice quickly through maturity or otherwise 
controlling the maturity or repricing of an institution s assets and liabilities in order to minimize interest rate risk is commonly referred to as gap management 
close matching of the repricing of assets and liabilities will normally result in little change in net interest income when interest rates change 
a mismatched gap position  will normally result in greater changes in net interest income as interest rates change 
along with internal gap management reports  we and our banks use an asset liability modeling methodology to analyze each bank s current gap position 
that methodology simulates our banks asset and liability base and projects future net interest income under several interest rate assumptions 
we strive to maintain an aggregate gap position  so that changes in interest rates will not negatively affect net interest income by more than in any month period 
we have not engaged in derivatives or hedging transactions to synthetically alter net interest income 
the following table indicates that at december   in the event of a sudden and sustained increase in prevailing market rates  our net interest income would be expected to increase while a decrease in rates would indicate a decrease in income 
changes in interest rate net interest income change percent change basis point rise   basis point rise   base rate scenario  basis point decline   basis point decline   the following table sets forth the maturities of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  interest rate sensitivity months months to months over to years over years total dollars in thousands rate sensitive assets loans      investment securities     other interest bearing assets total rate sensitive assets    rate sensitive liabilities savings deposits and interest bearing checking  time deposits      short term borrowings   long term borrowings     total rate sensitive liabilities    net gap      cumulative gap     cumulative ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities ratio of cumulative gap to interest earning assets the cumulative gap value indicated above indicates that a rise in interest rates would have a minimal effect on net interest income 
our ability to reprice rates on savings deposits and interest bearing checking in line with our markets or need for deposits help with the management of margins 
historically  rate changes on these deposits have not reflected the full effect of overall rate movements 
financial condition lending activities commercial loans 
this category includes loans to service  retail  wholesale and light manufacturing businesses  including agricultural service businesses 
commercial loans were million as of december   or  of total loans 
real estate loans 
real estate loans represent the largest class of our loans 
we categorize real estate loans as follows commercial 
commercial real estate loans totaled million at december   compared to million at december   a decrease of million  or 
this reduction primarily reflects the slowdown of the economy and the decrease in construction activity 
construction 
construction lending consists primarily of single family construction 
construction loans increased primarily due to an increase in such lending in johnson county  kansas 
to family residential 
residential loans totaled million at december   compared to million at december   a decrease of million  or 
loans in this category consist primarily of owner occupied residential loans 
this reduction is also indicative of the slowdown in the economy and slower homebuilding 
agricultural 
this category consists of loans secured by agricultural real estate 
agricultural loans totaled million at december   compared to million at december   a decrease of million  or 
held for sale 
loans held for sale represent residential loans intended to be sold to secondary investors  and in the process of being delivered  and student loans held for sale 
loans held for sale totaled million at december   compared to million at december   a decrease of million or 
most of the loans held for sale at december  were sold in agricultural loans 
agricultural loans are typically made to farmers  small corporate farms  and feed and grain dealers 
agricultural loans were million as of december   as compared to million as of december   a decrease of million  or 
agricultural loans as a percent of total loans decreased from in to in consumer and other loans 
loans classified as consumer and other loans include automobile  other personal loans and credit card loans

asset quality we follow regulatory guidelines in placing loans on a non accrual basis and place loans with doubtful principal repayment on a non accrual basis  whether current or past due 
we consider non performing assets to include all non accrual loans  other loans days or more past due as to principal and interest  other real estate owned oreo and repossessed assets 
we do not return a loan to accrual status until it is brought current with respect to both principal and interest and future principal payments are no longer in doubt 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  any previously accrued and uncollected interest income is reversed against current income 
restructured and impaired loans  other than non accrual loans  are considered insignificant for all years presented 
we would have recorded additional interest in the amounts of   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively  if non accrual loans had been current during these periods 
non performing assets are summarized in the following table december  dollars in thousands loans loans past due days or more still accruing   non accrual loans      non performing loans      other assets foreclosed assets held for sale     non performing assets     non performing loans as a percentage of total loans non performing assets as a percentage of total assets non performing assets as a percentage of total loans and oreo allowance for loan losses the success of a bank depends to a significant extent upon the quality of its assets particularly loans 
this is highlighted by the fact that net loans were of our total assets as of december  credit losses are inherent in the lending business 
the risk of loss will vary with general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and the quality of the collateral in the case of a collateralized loan  among other things 
management maintains an allowance for loan losses based on industry standards  management s experience  historical experience  an evaluation of economic conditions and regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality 
based upon such factors  management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectability of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for probable loan losses based upon a percentage of the outstanding balances and for specific loans if their ultimate collectability is considered questionable 
since certain lending activities involve greater risks  the percentage applied to specific loan types may vary 
we actively manage our past due and non performing loans in each bank in an effort to minimize credit losses and monitor asset quality to maintain an adequate loan loss allowance 
although management believes its allowance for loan losses is adequate for each bank and collectively  there can be no assurance that the allowance will prove sufficient to cover future loan losses 
further  although management uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used  or adverse developments arise with respect to non performing or performing loans 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover loan losses or that significant increases to the allowance will not be required in the future if economic conditions should worsen 
material additions to the allowance for loan losses would result in a decrease of our net income and capital and could result in the inability to pay dividends among other adverse consequences 
the allowance for loan losses on december   totaled million  or of outstanding loans compared to million  or of outstanding loans at december  see discussion for provision for loan losses  page  for additional detail

agricultural   consumer and other   total   investment activities our investment portfolio serves three important functions first  it facilitates the adjustment of the balance sheet s sensitivity to changes in interest rate movements  second  it provides an outlet for investing excess funds  and third  it provides liquidity 
the investment portfolio is structured to maximize the return on invested funds within conservative risk management guidelines 
the portfolio is comprised primarily of available for sale securities which include us treasury securities  us government agency obligations  state municipal obligations  federal reserve bank stock  fnma stock  and fhlb stock

deposit activities deposits are the major source of our banks funds for lending and other investment purposes 
in addition to deposits  our banks derive funds from interest payments  loan principal payments  loan and securities sales  and funds from operations 
scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds while deposit inflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions 
our banks may use borrowings on a short term basis  if necessary  to compensate for reductions in the availability of other sources of funds  or borrowings may be used on a longer term basis for general business purposes 
deposits are attracted principally from within our banks primary market area through the offering of a broad variety of deposit instruments including checking accounts  money market accounts  savings accounts  certificates of deposit including jumbo certificates in denominations of  or more  and retirement savings plans 
our banks have aggressively attempted to obtain deposits in selected markets to increase market share or meet particular liquidity needs 
we have not used brokered deposits and have not sought to attract deposits outside our market areas 
maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties are established by our banks on a periodic basis 
the determination of rates and terms is predicated on funds transaction and liquidity requirements  rates paid by competitors  growth goals and federal obligations

maturity period less than three months  over three months through six months  over six months through twelve months  over twelve months  total  we have no other time deposits in excess of  capital and liquidity sources of liquidity 
liquidity defines our ability  and the ability of our banks  to generate funds to support asset growth  satisfy other disbursement needs  meet deposit withdrawals and other fund reductions  maintain reserve requirements and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis 
the immediate liquidity needs of our banks are met primarily by federal funds sold  short term investments  deposits and the generally predictable cash flow  primarily repayments  from each bank s assets 
intermediate term liquidity is provided by our banks investment portfolios 
our banks also have established a credit facility with the fhlb  under which our banks are eligible for short term advances and long term borrowings secured by real estate loans or mortgage related investments 
our liquidity needs and funding are provided through non affiliated bank borrowing  cash dividends and tax payments from our subsidiary banks 
as described in note to the financial statements  we have a million line of credit with no outstanding borrowings at december  cash provided by operating activities for was million consisting primarily of net earnings adjusted for non cash items and the sale of loans held for sale 
cash used in investing activities was million  consisting primarily of increased loans of approximately million and net cash received in acquisitions of million 
net activity in financing consisted of a decrease in deposits of approximately million offset by a net borrowings of million which resulted in net cash provided of million 
capital 
we and our subsidiaries actively monitor the subsidiaries compliance with regulatory capital requirements 
the elements of capital adequacy standards include strict definitions of core capital and total assets  which include off balance sheet items such as commitments to extend credit 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent on the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital 
historically  our banks have increased core capital through retention of earnings or capital infusions 
the primary source of funds available to us is dividends by the subsidiaries 
each bank s ability to pay dividends may be limited by regulatory requirements 
at december   the subsidiaries could pay dividends of million without prior regulatory approval 
impact of inflation and changing prices the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on the performance of a financial institution than do changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
interest rate changes do not necessarily move in the same direction or have the same magnitude as changes in the prices of goods and services

any impairment loss is measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with statement s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the statement requires the company to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  the company must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
the company will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  an indication exists that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  the company must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with statement the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s statement of earnings 
as of the date of adoption  the company expects to have unamortized goodwill in the amount of million  and unamortized and identifiable intangible assets in the amount of million all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of statements and amortization expense related to goodwill was million  million  and million for the three years ended december  because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting statements and  it is not practical to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these statements on the company s financial statements at the date of this report  including whether it will be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle

accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived asests was adopted by the company on january  the statement established a single accounting model for all long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  which is to measure a long lived asset classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and to cease depreciation 
the statements also establishes criteria to determine when a long lived asset is held for sale and provides additional guidance on accounting for such specific circumstances 
the adoption of the new statement  not expected to have a significant effect on earnings or the financial position of the company

they involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements due to  among others  the following factors competitive pressures among financial services companies may increase significantly costs or difficulties related to the integration of the business of our company and its acquisition targets may be greater than expected changes in the interest rate environment may reduce interest margins general economic conditions  either nationally or in our markets  may be less favorable than expected legislative or regulatory changes may adversely affect the business in which our company and its subsidiaries are engaged technological changes may be more difficult or expensive than anticipated changes may occur in the securities markets we have described under factors that may affect future results of operations  financial condition or business additional factors that could cause actual results to be materially different from those described in the forward looking statements 
other factors that we have not identified in this report could also have this effect 
you are cautioned not to put undue reliance on any forward looking statement which speaks only as of the date it was made 
factors that may affect future results of operations  financial condition or business we are identifying important risks and uncertainties that could affect our company s results of operations  financial condition or business and that could cause them to differ materially from our company s historical results of operations  financial condition or business  or those contemplated by forward looking statements made herein or elsewhere  by  or on behalf of  our company 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those factors described below 
there is no assurance we can maintain our growth rate 
it may be difficult for us to maintain our rapid rate of growth 
we have completed several acquisitions in the past few years that have significantly enhanced our rate of growth 
we cannot be certain that we will continue to sustain this rate of growth or grow at all 
competition for suitable acquisition candidates is intense 
we are targeting acquisition candidates  particularly in the metropolitan and suburban areas  that a variety of larger financial institutions are also interested in acquiring 
we continue to review potential acquisition candidates and hold preliminary discussions with several of these candidates 
we cannot assure you that any of these discussions will be successful 
we may not be successful in identifying acquisition candidates or be able to acquire banks and financial services businesses on terms we feel are favorable 
the rural market areas we now serve afford limited  if any  opportunities for growth 
we believe future growth in our revenues and net earnings will depend on our growth in the metropolitan and suburban market areas where we have locations in addition to acquisitions 
the financial institutions in these metropolitan and suburban areas also compete intensely for assets and deposits 
this competition may adversely affect our ability to grow our asset and deposit base profitability 
loss of key personnel could have an adverse effect 
the loss of certain key personnel could adversely affect our operations 
our success depends in large part on the retention of a limited number of key persons  including michael w 
gullion  our chairman and chief executive officer  malcolm m 
aslin  our president and chief operating officer  and rick j 
tremblay  our executive vice president and chief financial officer 
we will likely undergo a difficult transition period if we lose the services of any or all of these individuals 
in recognition of this risk  we own  and are the beneficiary of  an insurance policy on the life of mr 
gullion providing death benefits of million and have entered into employment agreements with messrs 
gullion and aslin 
we also place great value on the experience of the presidents of our subsidiaries and the branches of our subsidiaries and on their relationships with the communities they serve 
the loss of these key persons could negatively impact the affected banking locations 
there is no assurance we will be able to retain our current key personnel or attract additional qualified key persons as needed 
local economic conditions could adversely affect operations 
changes in the local economic conditions could adversely affect our loan portfolio 
our success depends to a certain extent upon the general economic conditions of the local markets that we serve 
unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services to customers in those markets in kansas  oklahoma  missouri and florida  including a number of rural markets  where our subsidiary banks operate or are expected to operate 
our commercial  real estate and construction loans  and the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans  are impacted by the local economic conditions 
in the rural markets we serve  the predominant economic sector is agriculture 
we cannot assure you that favorable economic conditions will exist in such markets 
allowance for loan losses may not be adequate 
our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses 
as a lender  we are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to assure repayment 
credit losses are inherent in the lending business and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
our credit risk with respect to our real estate and construction loan portfolio relates principally to the general creditworthiness of individuals and the value of real estate serving as security for the repayment of loans 
our credit risk with respect to our commercial and consumer installment loan portfolio relates principally to the general creditworthiness of businesses and individuals within our local markets 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for potential losses based on a number of factors 
if our assumptions are wrong  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover our loan losses 
we may have to increase the allowance in the future 
material additions to our allowance for loan losses would decrease our net earnings 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect profitability 
we may be unable to manage interest rate risk that could reduce our net interest income 
like other financial institutions  our results of operations are impacted principally by net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest expense paid on deposits and other borrowings 
we cannot predict or control changes in interest rates 
regional and local economic conditions and the policies of regulatory authorities  including monetary policies of the federal reserve  affect interest income and interest expense 
interest rate cuts by the federal reserve throughout have generally reduced our net interest income 
while we continually take measures intended to manage the risks from changes in market interest rates  changes in interest rates can still have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
technological change may impair our competitiveness 
we cannot predict how changes in technology will impact our business 
the financial services market  including banking services  is increasingly affected by advances in technology including developments in telecommunications  data processing  automation  internet based banking  telebanking  and debit cards and so called smart cards 
our ability to compete successfully in the future will depend on whether we can anticipate and respond to technological changes 
to develop these and other new technologies  we will likely have to make additional capital investments 
although we continually invest in new technology  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources or access to the necessary proprietary technology to remain competitive in the future 
the banking business is highly competitive 
we operate in a competitive environment 
in the metropolitan and suburban areas in which we compete  other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  brokerage and investment banking firms and other financial intermediaries offer similar services 
we also face competition in our rural markets 
many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits and may offer certain services our subsidiary banks and businesses do not currently provide 
in addition  some of the non bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern our subsidiary banks and businesses 
our profitability depends upon the ability of our subsidiaries to compete in our primary market areas 
effects of regulatory changes cannot be predicted 
we are subject to extensive regulation 
the banking industry is heavily regulated under both federal and state law 
these regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors and the federal deposit insurance corporation  not our creditors or stockholders 
our non bank subsidiaries are also subject to the supervision of the federal reserve board  in addition to other regulatory and self regulatory agencies including the securities and exchange commission  the national association of securities dealers  and state securities and insurance regulators 
regulations affecting banks and financial services businesses are undergoing continuous change  and the ultimate effect of such changes cannot be predicted 
regulations and laws may be modified at any time  and new legislation may be enacted that affects us  our subsidiary banks or our non bank subsidiaries 
we cannot assure you that such modifications or new laws will not adversely affect us 
fdic assessments may adversely affect us and our subsidiary banks 
our subsidiary banks may be forced to pay for any losses the federal deposit insurance corporation incurs if it provides assistance to any of our other subsidiary banks 
federal law contains a cross guarantee provision that could require any of our insured subsidiary banks to pay for losses incurred by the federal deposit insurance corporation if it provides assistance to another of our insured subsidiary banks or in the event a subsidiary bank fails 
if another of our subsidiary banks is assessed for any assistance the federal deposit insurance corporation may provide  such assessment could materially effect that subsidiary bank s financial condition as well as ours 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management asset liability management refers to management s efforts to minimize fluctuations in net interest income caused by interest rate changes 
this is accomplished by managing the repricing of interest rate sensitive interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
an interest rate sensitive balance sheet item is one that is able to reprice quickly through maturity or otherwise 
controlling the maturity or repricing of an institution s liabilities and assets in order to minimize interest rate risk is commonly referred to as gap management 
close matching of the repricing of assets and liabilities will normally result in little change in net interest income when interest rates change 
a mismatched gap position will normally result in changes in net interest income as interest rates change 
along with internal gap management reports  we and our banks use an asset liability modeling service to analyze each bank s current gap position 
the system simulates our banks asset and liability base and projects future net interest income results under several interest rate assumptions 
we strive to maintain an aggregate gap position such that changes in interest rates will not affect net interest income by more than in any month period 
we have not engaged in derivatives transactions for its own account 
the following table indicates that  at december   if there had been a sudden and sustained increase in prevailing market interest rates  our net interest income would be expected to increase  while a decrease in rates would indicate a decrease in income 
changes in interest rate net interest income change percent change basis point rise   basis point rise   base rate scenario  basis point decline   basis point decline
