item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains descriptions of our expectations regarding future trends affecting our business 
these forward looking statements and other forward looking statements made elsewhere in this document are made in reliance upon safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of several factors  including  but not limited to those factors set forth under factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this document  which include without limitation the fact that our stock price may be volatile which could affect the value of your investment  that our operating results fluctuate significantly  that a long lasting economic downturn in the global economy impacting information technology spending could negatively impact our business  that our business is dependent on the storage area network market that is new and unpredictable  and that our financial 
table of contents condition will be materially harmed if we do not maintain and gain market or industry acceptance of our products 
readers of this annual report on form k are urged to read those sections in their entirety 
in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward looking information included in this document  the inclusion of information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives or plans will be achieved 
qlogic undertakes no obligation to update or revise these forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
results of operations the following table sets forth the results of operations and percentage of net revenues in our consolidated statements of income fiscal year ended april  april  march  in thousands net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses engineering and development selling and marketing general and administrative merger and related expenses total operating expenses operating income net revenues our net revenues are derived primarily from the sale of scsi and fibre channel based i o products and enclosure management products 
we also license certain designs and receive royalty revenues and non recurring engineering fees 
net revenues in fiscal decreased million or from fiscal to million 
the decrease was the result of a million increase in sales of fibre channel products  which was more than offset by a million decrease in sales of scsi products  and a million decrease in ide based royalties 
net revenues in fiscal increased million or from fiscal to million 
the increase was the result of a million increase in sales of scsi products  a million increase in sales of fibre channel products  partially offset by a million decrease in ide based royalties 
export revenues primarily to pacific rim countries in fiscal year decreased million or from fiscal to approximately million 
export revenues in fiscal increased million or from fiscal  to approximately million 
as a percentage of net revenues  export revenues accounted for in fiscal year  in fiscal year  and in fiscal year the decrease in export net revenues as a percentage of total revenues is due to a decrease in net revenues in pacific rim countries 
the decreases in export revenue dollars are primarily due to decreased sales to customers in japan 
export revenues are denominated in us dollars 
we do not expect the uncertainty in selected pacific rim foreign currency markets to have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 
a small number of our customers account for a substantial portion of our net revenues  and we expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
our four largest customers accounted for approximately of net revenues in fiscal year  in fiscal year  and in fiscal year in fiscal  fujitsu limited accounted for of 
table of contents net revenues  and sun microsystems accounted for of the company s net revenues 
in fiscal  fujitsu limited accounted for of net revenues  and sun microsystems accounted for of the company s net revenues 
in fiscal  fujitsu limited accounted for of net revenues and sun microsystems accounted for of net revenues 
we believe that our major customers continually evaluate whether or not to purchase products from alternate or additional sources 
additionally  customers economic and market conditions frequently change 
accordingly  there can also be no assurance that a major customer will not reduce  delay or eliminate its purchases from us 
any such reduction  delay or loss of purchases could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
gross profit cost of revenues consist primarily of raw materials including wafers and completed chips from third party manufacturers  assembly and test labor  overhead and warranty costs 
the gross profit percentage in fiscal was  a decrease from in fiscal the percentage decline was due to a reduction in the contribution of license fees and a decrease in margins on sales of earlier generation scsi products 
the gross profit percentage in fiscal was  a decrease from in fiscal the percentage decline was due to a reduction in the contribution of license fees combined with an increase in sales of switch products with lower margins 
our ability to maintain our current gross profit percentage can be significantly affected by factors such as supply costs and  in particular  the cost of silicon wafers  the worldwide semiconductor foundry capacity  the mix of products shipped  competitive price pressures  the timeliness of volume shipments of new products and our ability to achieve manufacturing cost reductions 
we anticipate that it will be increasingly more difficult to reduce manufacturing costs 
as a result  we anticipate gross profit percentages to decrease in the future 
operating expenses engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  development related material  occupancy costs  and computer support 
we believe continued investments in engineering and development activities are critical to achieving our strategic objectives 
as a result  we expect that engineering and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal engineering and development expenses were million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year as a percentage of net revenues this amounted to in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal the increase in spending each fiscal year was largely due to increased levels of fibre channel and scsi design and engineering support 
the increase as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal year is attributed to the increase in development expenses during a period in which we experienced moderate revenue declines 
in fiscal year we incurred a million charge for acquired in process technology relating to the acquisition of adaptiveraid technology from borg adaptive technologies  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of nstor corporation 
the company recorded the purchase price as a one time charge for in process research and development of million to engineering and development expense in the fourth fiscal quarter ended april  selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing salaries  sales commissions and related expenses  promotional activities and travel for sales and marketing personnel 
we believe continued investments of these types of expenses are critical to the success of our strategy of expanding relationships with our customers 
as a result  we expect sales and marketing expenditures will continue to increase in the future 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues this amounted to in fiscal  in fiscal 
table of contents  and in fiscal the increase in both dollars and as a percentage of net revenues from fiscal to fiscal relates to an increased level of sales and support personnel to more completely serve our customers 
the increase in dollars from fiscal to fiscal reflects an increase in sales commissions paid as a result of the increase in revenues 
the decrease in expenses as a percentage of revenues from fiscal to fiscal relates to economies of scale benefits realized from the growth in revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  accounting  human resources and information technology personnel 
non personnel related expenses consist of recruiting fees  professional services  and corporate expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional costs relating to the growth of the business and our operation as a public company 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues this amounted to in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal the increase in both dollars and as a percentage of net revenues from fiscal to fiscal was due to increased costs for depreciation related to improved business systems and insurance 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal by million due to an increase in personnel  combined with increases in the bad debt reserves related to accounts receivable growth 
merger and related expenses 
merger and related expenses in fiscal year consisted primarily of direct and incremental transaction costs  such as fees for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants  and other related fees and expenses 
merger and related costs of approximately million were incurred in connection with the merger with ancor accounted for as a pooling of interests 
non operating income interest and other income  was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in the increases in interest and other income in fiscal  and are largely due to increases in cash equivalents and investment balances due to million in net proceeds received from a secondary stock offering in the second quarter of and million in net proceeds received from intel pursuant to a stock purchase agreement in the third quarter of fiscal additionally  cash equivalent and investment balances have increased due to cash flow from operations in each of the last three fiscal years 
income tax provision our effective tax rates were approximately in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal the elevated tax rate in fiscal was due to nondeductible costs incurred in conjunction with the merger with ancor communications  inc for more information on the merger  please see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment revenue recognition  inventory valuation  and accounting for investments 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we sell our products domestically and internationally primarily through oem and distribution channel customers including distributors  system integrators and value added resellers who sell directly to end users 
our significant customers include leading storage solution providers  server oems and storage oems 
we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment except for sales to distributor customers  most of which have contractual rights of return and or price protection 
revenue from sales to distributors is recognized when these distributors ship our products to their end user customers based on data we receive from such distributors 
reserves for uncollectible accounts and allowances for estimated sales returns are provided at the time revenue is recognized 
we reserve for uncollectible accounts and product returns based on our historical experience and expectations regarding account collectibility and future returns related to products shipped 
royalty and product development revenue is recognized when earned and when receipt is assured 
for all sales  we use either a binding purchase order or signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors and major oems are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
our products are generally covered by a warranty of one to five years 
we accrue a warranty reserve for the estimated costs to provide warranty services  which is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual will increase resulting in decreased gross profit 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis 
we use a standard cost system for purposes of determining cost 
the standards are adjusted periodically to ensure they approximate actual costs 
we write down the carrying value of our inventory to market value for estimated obsolete or excess inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we compare current inventory levels on a product basis to our current sales forecasts in order to assess our inventory balance 
our sales forecasts are based on economic conditions and trends both current and projected  anticipated customer demand and acceptance of our current products  expected future products and other assumptions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
accounting for investments 
we classify our investments in marketable securities as available for sale  based on the criteria set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
we carry these investments at fair value  based on quoted market prices  and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses are recognized upon the sale of our marketable securities in our statements of operations 
we have established investment policy guidelines that we use to manage the financial institutions that have custody of our funds 
based on our guidelines  our investments generally consist of us government  state and local  and corporate debt obligations with maturities ranging from one to sixty months 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
the fair market value of our investments in marketable securities may be adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates  and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
additionally  the amount of interest income that we earn on our investments may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
new accounting standards effective july   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas business combinations 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for by a single method the purchase method 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents sfas goodwill and other intangible assets requires that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives not to be amortized but rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
we are required to adopt sfas on april  however  goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  are subject to the amortization provisions of sfas the adoption of sfas is expected to reduce general and administrative expenses by million annually through december in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources our combined balances of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments have increased to million at march  compared to million at april  the increase was attributable to positive cash flow from operations  primarily net income  during the twelve months ended march  our primary source of liquidity is derived from working capital and cash from operations 
we also have an unused million unsecured line of credit with silicon valley bank 
working capital increased million to million from april  to march  the increase in working capital in the fiscal year ended march  was largely attributable to positive cash flow from operations 
the million line of credit facility with silicon valley bank allows us to borrow at the bank s prime rate 
the credit facility expires on july   and  although there can be no assurance  we currently expect to renew this line of credit 
there were no borrowings under this credit facility on march  our cash flow provided by operations was million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the growth in cash provided by operations compared to the prior year was primarily due to decreases in inventories and accounts and notes receivable  and increases in other accrued liabilities 
our inventory turns increased to in fiscal from in the comparable prior year period largely due to a decrease in inventory resulting from improved management controls in the inventory management function 
our cash flow used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was primarily due to increases in purchases of investments  net of maturities that were partially offset by decreases in additions to property and equipment 
additions to property and equipment were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal our cash flow provided by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the fiscal year decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to a reduction in proceeds from issuance of stock under employee stock plans 
we have certain obligations and commitments to make future payments in the form of non cancelable purchase orders to our suppliers and commitments under operating lease arrangements 
at march   there were million in non cancelable purchase orders all due within one year 
disclosure of operating lease commitments can be located in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalent balances  short term investments  debt facilities and cash flows from operating activities will provide the company with sufficient funds to finance its operations for at least the next months 
factors that may affect future results except for the historical information contained herein  the information in this report constitutes forward looking statements 
when used in this report the words shall  should  forecast  all of  projected  believes  anticipates  expects  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
in addition  we may from time to time make oral forward looking statements 
we wish to caution readers that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the 
table of contents forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below  as well as those discussed above in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or elsewhere in this report 
our stock price may be volatile which could affect the value of your investment 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially  and there can be no assurance that such volatility will not continue 
from january  through april   the market price has ranged from a low of per share to a high of per share 
several factors could impact our stock price including  but not limited to announcements concerning qlogic  our competitors or customers  quarterly fluctuations in our operating results  introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors  conditions in the semiconductor industry  changes in market projections by industry forecasters  changes in estimates of our earnings by industry analysts  and market conditions for high technology equities in general 
in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume volatility in recent years and stock prices of technology companies have been especially volatile 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many public companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our operating results fluctuate significantly  which could cause our stock price to decline if our results fail to meet investors and analysts expectations 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in sales and operating results from quarter to quarter 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current profitability in the future 
a significant portion of our net revenues in each fiscal quarter result from orders booked in that quarter 
orders placed by major customers are typically based on their forecasted sales and inventory levels for our products 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may be the result of changes in purchasing patterns by one or more of our major customers  order changes or rescheduling  gain or loss of significant customers  customer policies pertaining to desired inventory levels of our products  negotiations of rebates and extended payment terms  changes in our ability to anticipate in advance the mix of customer orders  level of inventory our customers require us to maintain in our field warehouses  the time  availability and sale of new products  changes in the mix of products having differing gross margins  variations in manufacturing capacities  efficiencies and costs  the availability and cost of components  including silicon wafers  warranty expenses  
table of contents variations in product development and other operating expenses  revenue adjustments related to product returns  adoption of new accounting pronouncements and or changes in our policies  or general economic and other conditions affecting the timing of customer orders and capital spending 
our quarterly results of operations are also influenced by competitive factors  including the pricing and availability of our products and our competitors products 
although we do not maintain our own wafer manufacturing facility  large portions of our expenses are fixed and difficult to reduce in a short period of time 
if net revenues do not meet our expectations  our fixed expenses would magnify the effect on net income of such shortfall in net revenues 
furthermore  announcements regarding new products and technologies could cause our customers to defer or cancel purchases of our products 
order deferrals by our customers  delays in our introduction of new products  and longer than anticipated design in cycles for our products have in the past adversely effected our quarterly results of operations 
due to these factors  as well as other unanticipated factors  it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  and as a result  the price of our common stock could significantly decrease 
a long lasting downturn in the global economy that impacts information technology spending could negatively affect our business 
the global economy is in the midst of a slowdown that has had wide ranging effects on markets that we serve  particularly information technology  data storage and networking industries 
this downturn has had a negative effect on our revenues and operating results  and many analysts have predicted that the recent terrorist attacks on the united states and the resulting worldwide conflict will prolong the downturn 
we cannot predict the depth or duration of this downturn  and if it grows more severe or continues for a long period of time  our ability to increase or maintain our revenues and operating results may be impaired 
in addition  because we intend to continue to make significant investments in research and development during this downturn  and to maintain extensive ongoing customer service and support capability  any further decline in the rate of growth of our revenues will have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 
our business is dependent on the storage area network market that is relatively new and unpredictable  and if this market does not develop and expand as we anticipate  our business will suffer 
fibre channel based storage area networks  or sans  were first deployed in as a result  the market for sans and related storage router products has only recently begun to develop and is rapidly evolving 
because this market is new  it is difficult to predict its potential size or future growth rate 
a significant number of our products are used exclusively in sans and  therefore  our business is dependent on the san market 
accordingly  the widespread adoption of sans for use in organizations computing systems is critical to our future success 
most of the organizations that potentially may purchase our products from our customers have invested substantial resources in their existing computing and data storage systems and  as a result  may be reluctant or slow to adopt a new approach like sans 
sans are often implemented in connection with the deployment of new storage systems and servers 
therefore  our future success is also substantially dependent on the market for new storage systems and servers 
furthermore  the ability of the different components used in a san to function effectively  or interoperate  with each other when placed in a computing system has not yet been achieved on a widespread basis 
until greater interoperability is achieved  customers may be reluctant to deploy sans 
our success in generating revenue in the emerging san market will depend on  among other things  our ability to educate potential oem customers  distributors  resellers  system integrators  storage service providers and end user organizations about the benefits of sans  maintain and enhance our relationships with oem customers  distributors  resellers  system integrators  and storage system providers  
table of contents predict and base our products on standards which ultimately become industry standards  and achieve interoperability between our products and other san components from diverse vendors 
our financial condition will be materially harmed if we do not maintain and gain market or industry acceptance of our products 
the markets in which we compete involve rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and continuing improvements in products and services 
our future success depends  in part  on our ability to enhance our current products and to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products that keep pace with technological developments and industry standards  compete effectively on the basis of price and performance  and adequately address original equipment manufacturer customer and end user customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
we believe that to remain competitive in the future we will need to continue to develop new products  which will require a significant investment in new product development 
a significant portion of our revenues is generated from fibre channel technology 
we  and some of our competitors  are developing alternative technologies that may compete with the market acceptance of our fibre channel products  such as iscsi and infiniband 
if alternative standards are adopted by the industry  we may not be able to develop products for new standards in a timely manner 
further  even if alternative technologies do augment fibre channel revenues  our products may not be fully developed in time to be accepted by our customers 
even if our new products are developed on time  we may not be able to manufacture them at competitive prices in sufficient volumes 
we depend on a limited number of customers  and any decrease in revenue or cash flows from any one of our customers could cause our stock price to decline 
a small number of customers account for a substantial portion of our net revenues  and we expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenues in the foreseeable future 
additionally  we are also subject to credit risk associated with the concentration of our accounts receivable 
the loss of any of our major customers would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
some of these customers are based in the pacific rim  which is subject to economic and political uncertainties 
in addition  a majority of our customers order products through written purchase orders as opposed to long term supply contracts and  therefore  such customers are generally not obligated to purchase products from us for any extended period 
major customers also have significant leverage over us and may attempt to change the terms  including pricing  which could materially adversely effect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
this risk is increased due to the potential for some of these customers to merge with or acquire another of our customers 
as our original equipment manufacturer customers are pressured to reduce prices as a result of competitive factors  we may be required to contractually commit to price reductions for our products before we know how  or if  cost reductions can be obtained 
if we are unable to achieve such cost reductions  our gross margins could decline and such decline could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition within our product markets is intense and includes numerous established competitors 
the markets for our products are highly competitive and are characterized by short product life cycles  price erosion  rapidly changing technology  frequent product performance improvements and evolving industry standards 
we currently compete primarily with adaptec inc and lsi logic corporation in the scsi sector of the i o market 
in the fibre channel host bus adapter sector of the i o market  we compete primarily with lsi logic corporation  emulex corporation  jni corporation and adaptec inc in the fibre channel host controller chip sector of the market we compete primarily with agilent technologies and lsi logic corporation 
in the switch products sector  we compete with brocade communications  mcdata corporation 
table of contents and several smaller companies 
in the enclosure management sector  we compete primarily with vitesse semiconductor corporation 
we may compete with some of our larger disk drive and computer systems customers  some of which have the capability to develop i o controller integrated circuits for use in their own products 
at least one large original equipment manufacturer customer in the past has decided to vertically integrate and has therefore stopped purchasing from us 
we will need to continue to develop products appropriate to our markets to remain competitive as our competitors continue to introduce products with improved performance characteristics 
while we continue to devote significant resources to research and development  these efforts may not be successful  or may not be developed and introduced in a timely manner 
further  several of our competitors have greater resources devoted to securing semiconductor foundry capacity because of long term agreements regarding supply flow  equity or financing agreements or direct ownership of a foundry 
in addition  while relatively few competitors offer a full range of storage area networking products  additional domestic and foreign manufacturers may increase their presence in these markets 
we may not be able to compete successfully against these or other competitors 
if we are unable to design  develop and introduce competitive new products on a timely basis  our future operating results will be materially and adversely affected 
our distributors may not adequately distribute our products which could negatively affect our operations 
our distributors generally offer a diverse array of products from several different manufacturers and suppliers 
accordingly  we are at risk that these distributors may give higher priority to selling products from other suppliers  thus reducing their efforts to sell our products 
a reduction in sales efforts by our current distributors could materially adversely impact our business or operating results 
our distributors may on occasion build inventories in anticipation of substantial growth in sales  and if such growth does not occur as rapidly as we anticipate  distributors may decrease the amount of product ordered from us in subsequent quarters 
in addition  if we decrease our distributor incentive programs  our distributors may temporarily decrease the amounts of product purchased from us 
this could result in a change of business habits  and distributors may decide to decrease the amount of product held and reduce their inventory levels 
in addition  we may from time to time take actions to reduce levels of our products at distributors 
we depend on our relationships with wafer suppliers and other subcontractors  and a loss of these relationships may lead to unpredictable consequences which may harm our results of operations if alternative supply sources are not available 
we currently rely on several independent foundries to manufacture our semiconductor products either in finished form or wafer form 
generally  we conduct business with some of our foundries through written purchase orders as opposed to long term supply contracts 
therefore  these foundries are generally not obligated to supply products to us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specified price 
if a foundry terminates its relationship with us or if our supply from a foundry is otherwise interrupted  we may not have a sufficient amount of time to replace the supply of products manufactured by that foundry 
as a result  we may not be able to meet customer demands  which could harm our business 
historically  there have been periods when there has been a worldwide shortage of advanced process technology foundry capacity 
the manufacture of semiconductor devices is subject to a wide variety of factors  including the availability of raw materials  the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  impurities in the materials used  and the performance of personnel and equipment 
we are continuously evaluating potential new sources of supply 
however  the qualification process and the production ramp up for additional foundries have in the past taken  and could in the future take  longer than anticipated 
new supply sources may not be able or willing to satisfy our wafer requirements on a timely basis or at acceptable quality or unit prices 
we use multiple sources of supply for some of our products  which may require customers to perform separate product qualifications 
we have not developed alternate sources of supply for all of our products and our newly introduced products are typically produced initially by a single foundry until alternate sources can be qualified 
in particular  our integrated single chip fibre channel controller is manufactured by lsi logic and 
table of contents integrates lsi logic s transceiver technology 
in the event that lsi logic is unable or unwilling to satisfy our requirements for this technology  our marketing efforts related to fibre channel products would be delayed and  as such  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the requirement that a customer perform separate product qualifications  or a customer s inability to obtain a sufficient supply of products from us  may cause that customer to satisfy its product requirements from our competitors 
constraints or delays in the supply of our products  due to capacity constraints  unexpected disruptions at our foundries or with our subcontractors  delays in obtaining additional production at the existing foundries or in obtaining production from new foundries  shortages of raw materials or other reasons  could result in the loss of customers 
our products are complex and may contain undetected software or hardware errors that could lead to an increase in our costs  reduce our net revenues or damage our reputation 
products as complex as ours frequently contain undetected software or hardware errors when first introduced or as newer versions are released 
we have from time to time found errors in existing  new or enhanced products 
the occurrence of hardware or software errors could adversely affect sales of our products  cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems 
terrorist activities and resulting military actions could adversely affect our business 
the terrorist attacks in new york and washington  dc have disrupted commerce throughout the united states and europe 
the continued threat of terrorism within the united states and europe and the military action and heightened security measures in response to such threat may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world 
to the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  delays in collecting cash  a general decrease in corporate spending on information technology  or our inability to effectively market  manufacture or ship our products  our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we are unable to predict whether the threat of terrorism or the responses thereto will result in any long term commercial disruptions or if such activities or responses will have any long term material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
because we depend on foreign customers and suppliers  we are subject to international economic  regulatory and political risks that could harm our financial condition 
we expect that export revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we are subject to several risks  which include a greater difficulty of administering our business globally  compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulatory requirements  such as export requirements  tariffs and other barriers  differences in intellectual property protections  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  potentially longer accounts receivable cycles  currency fluctuations  export control restrictions  overlapping or differing tax structures  political and economic instability  and general trade restrictions 
a significant number of our customers and suppliers are located in japan 
historically  the asian markets have suffered from economic uncertainty 
this uncertainty has taken place especially in countries that have 
table of contents had a collapse in both their currency and stock markets 
these economic pressures have reduced liquidity in the banking systems of the affected countries and  when coupled with spare industrial production capacity  could lead to widespread financial difficulty among the companies in this region 
our export sales are invoiced in us dollars and  accordingly  if the relative value of the us dollar in comparison to the currency of our foreign customers should increase  the resulting effective price increase of our products to such foreign customers could result in decreased sales 
there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may need to engage in high risk transactions to guarantee we have production capacity which may require us to seek additional financing and result in dilution to our stockholders 
the semiconductor industry has  in the past  experienced shortages of available foundry capacity 
accordingly  in order to secure an adequate supply of wafers  we may consider various possible supply agreements 
those types of agreements include the use of take or pay contracts  making equity investments in  or advances to  wafer manufacturing companies in exchange for guaranteed production capacity  or the formation of joint ventures to own and operate or construct foundries or to develop certain products 
any of these arrangements would involve financial risk to us and could require us to commit a substantial amount of our funds or provide technology licenses in return for guaranteed production capacity 
the need to commit our own funds may require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
the sale or issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
this kind of additional financing  if necessary  may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
we anticipate engaging in mergers  acquisitions and strategic investments  however  these activities may adversely affect our results of operations and stock price if they do not complement our business 
we anticipate that our future growth may depend in part on our ability to identify and acquire complementary businesses  technologies or product lines that are compatible with ours 
mergers and acquisitions involve numerous risks  including uncertainties in identifying and pursuing target companies  difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks associated with entering markets or conducting operations with which we have no or limited direct prior experience  the potential loss of current customers and or retention of the acquired company s customers  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
further  we may never realize the perceived benefits of a business combination 
future acquisitions by us could dilute stockholders investment  and cause us to incur debt  contingent liabilities and amortization impairment expense related to intangible assets  all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
effective july   the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  has issued  and we have adopted  sfas business combinations 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and requires that all business combinations implemented after june  be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
as a result  we will not be able to complete a business combination without incurring goodwill or other intangible assets 
sfas goodwill and other intangible assets eliminates the quarterly and yearly recurring charges for the amortization of goodwill 
a significant charge to earnings may be recorded if it can be determined that the goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired 
this potential charge could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we have made  and plan to continue to make  investments in technology companies including privately held companies in a development stage 
many of these private equity investments are inherently risky because the companies businesses may never develop  and we may incur losses related to these investments 
we may be required to reduce the value of those investments as reflected on our balance sheet  which also may affect 
table of contents our results of operations 
in addition if we incur a charge to reflect other than temporary declines in the value of our private equity investments below our recorded value  our balance sheet and results of operations will be reduced 
our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with strategic alliances 
we have alliances with leading information technology companies  and we plan to continue our strategy of developing key alliances in order to expand our reach into emerging markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our ongoing strategic alliances or that we will be able to find further suitable business relationships as we develop new products and strategies 
any failure to continue or expand such relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial conditions 
there can be no assurance that companies with which we have strategic alliances  certain of which have substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources than us  will not develop or market products in competition with us in the future  discontinue their alliances with us or form alliances with our competitors 
continued rapid growth will strain our operations and require that we incur costs to upgrade our infrastructure 
we have recently experienced a period of rapid growth and expansion that has placed  and continues to place  a significant strain on our resources 
unless we manage this growth effectively  we may make mistakes in executing our business such as inaccurate sales forecasting  material planning  inventory management or financial reporting  which may result in unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results 
we may not be able to install adequate control systems in an efficient and timely manner  and our current or planned personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
in addition  we test substantially all of our products prior to shipment 
if our capacity to conduct this testing does not expand concurrently with the anticipated growth of our business  product shipments could be delayed  which could result in delayed or lost revenues and customer dissatisfaction 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  we may not be able to sustain or grow our business 
our future success largely depends on our key engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel  including highly skilled semiconductor design personnel and software developers 
we also must identify and hire additional personnel 
if we lose the services of key personnel  our business would be adversely affected 
we believe that the market for key personnel in the industries in which we compete is highly competitive 
in particular  periodically we have experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified engineers and other technical personnel and anticipate that competition for such personnel will increase in the future 
we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel with the skills and expertise necessary to develop new products in the future  or to manage our business  both in the united states and abroad 
our proprietary rights may be inadequately protected  and infringement claims or adverse judgments could harm our competitive position 
although we have patent protection on some aspects of our technology in some jurisdictions  we rely primarily on trade secrets  copyrights and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights  that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or that we can maintain such technology as trade secrets 
there also can be no assurance that any patents we possess will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states or at all 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  our business would be negatively impacted 

table of contents intellectual property claims have been made against us in the past  and patent or other intellectual property infringement claims could be made against us in the future 
although patent and intellectual property disputes may be settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and the necessary licenses or similar arrangements may not be available to us on satisfactory terms or at all 
as a result  we could be prevented from manufacturing and selling some of our products 
in addition  if we litigate these kinds of claims  the litigation could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention from other matters 
our business could suffer regardless of the outcome of the litigation 
our supply of wafers and other components can also be interrupted by intellectual property infringement claims against our suppliers 
our charter document and shareholder rights plan may discourage companies from acquiring us and offering our stockholders a premium for their stock 
pursuant to our certificate of incorporation  our board of directors is authorized to approve the issuance of shares of currently undesignated preferred stock without any vote or future action by the stockholders 
pursuant to this authority  in june our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan and declared a dividend of a right to purchase one one hundredths of a share of preferred stock for each outstanding share of our common stock 
after adjustment for each of the three two for one stock splits effected by us to date  our common stock now carries one eighth of the preferred stock purchase right per share 
the shareholder rights plan may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our stock 
this may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of the common stock and may adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates when interpreting and applying critical accounting policies 
we use estimates when recording certain balances in our consolidated financial statements  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these estimates impact the amounts reported in the financial statements  and include estimates with respect to the following sales discounts and returns  allowances for bad debts  warranty expenses  deferred revenues  and valuation of inventory 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates  which could in turn impact the amounts reported in our financial statements 
our corporate headquarters and principal design facilities are located in a region that is subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters  as well as electricity shortages 
our california facilities  including our principal executive offices  our principal design facilities  and our critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults 
we are not specifically insured for earthquakes  or other such natural disasters 
any personal injury or damage to the facilities as a result of such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  our operations depend upon a continuing adequate supply of electricity  natural gas and water 
these energy sources have historically been available on a continuous basis and in adequate quantities for our needs 
an interruption in the supply of raw materials or energy inputs for any reason would have an adverse effect on our manufacturing operations 
recently  california has had power shortages resulting in rolling blackouts  or the temporary and generally unannounced loss of electrical power 
these shortages could affect our ability to supply products to our customers on a timely basis
