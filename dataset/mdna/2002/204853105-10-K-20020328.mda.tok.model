item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
statements below which are not historical facts are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
these statements may contain words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates  or other wording indicating future results 
forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in forward looking statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to  those discussed under risk factors following item a below  and elsewhere in this report 
we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements to reflect any event or circumstance that may arise after the date of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  which are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we report our revenue and gross profit in three business segments development  production and connectivity products 
we have adopted statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition 
under sop  we recognize revenue to distributors  resellers and end users upon shipment provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we do not provide distributors  resellers or customers price protection  return or exchange rights 
generally  our distributors do not maintain inventory  however  they do have the right to return inventory upon termination of their distribution agreement 
we review inventory levels held by distributors  if any  quarterly to ensure that any potential returns in the event of termination are not material 
when we have shipped products but some elements essential to the functionality of the products have not been completed  revenue and associated cost of revenue are deferred until all remaining elements have been delivered 
software maintenance support revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance support period 
provisions for warranty costs are recorded at the time products are shipped 
our cash equivalents and short term investments are placed in portfolios managed by two professional money management firms under the investment guidelines we have established 
these guidelines address the critical objectives of preservation of principal  avoiding inappropriate concentrations  meeting liquidity requirements  and delivering maximum after tax returns 
we classify all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of days or less to be cash equivalents and those with a maturity greater than days but less than one year to be short term investments 
cash equivalents and short term investments consist principally of investments in commercial paper  investment quality corporate bonds  collateralized mortgage obligations  us government agency securities and money market funds 
we account for income taxes under the liability method  which requires  among other things  that deferred income taxes be provided for temporary differences between the tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities and their financial statement reported amounts 
in addition  deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards 
the preparation of our tax provision and deferred tax assets requires us to make estimates and assumptions including areas such as the calculation of research and development credits  and future taxable income 
if these estimates change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  and our future tax provisions may result in different effective tax rates 
a valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
overview we are a provider of advanced verification systems and connectivity products for existing and emerging digital communications standards such as usb  usb  ieee  bluetooth wireless technology  infiniband  serial ata and ethernet 
our products are used by semiconductor  device  system and software companies at each phase of their products lifecycles from development through production and market deployment 
our verification systems consist of development and production products that accurately monitor communications traffic and diagnose operational problems to ensure that products comply with standards and operate with other devices as well as to assist system manufacturers in downloading software onto new computers 
our connectivity products enable reliable  uninterrupted service for broadband internet access 
we currently outsource most of the manufacturing of our verification systems and connectivity products so that we may concentrate our resources on the design  development and marketing of our existing and new products 
in the year ended december   our revenue from our development products was million  from production products was million and from connectivity products was million 
historically  we have generated a majority of our revenue across all segments from products for the usb standard 
revenue from our usb products accounted for approximately of our revenue in the year ended december   of which was from our usb products 
during  our production products revenue was significantly impacted by the personal computer industry wide delay in introduction of usb systems 
also during  our connectivity products revenue was significantly impacted by the softness in the broadband internet access market  and additional competitive pressure due to improved availability of next generation cable and dsl modems with integrated usb support 
in june  we began to offer software maintenance support contracts for certain of our development products 
maintenance revenue for the year ended december  was approximately  and deferred maintenance revenue was approximately  at december  our distribution channels through included a direct sales force and a network of distributors and value added resellers 
we sold our products in north america through our direct sales force and resellers and internationally through our direct sales force and distributors 
beginning in january  we altered our relationship with our north american resellers by converting them to manufacturer s representatives and we are now accepting orders directly from our customers while our manufacturer s representatives provide only sales support 
we do not expect that this relationship change will have a significant impact on our future operating results 
we have also continued to add additional north american channel resources as manufacturer s representatives to support the expansion of our north american sales efforts 
historically  a substantial portion of our revenue has been derived from customers outside of the united states 
in the year ended december   of our revenue was derived from international customers  of which was derived from customers based in japan  was derived from customers based in other parts of asia  and was derived from customers based in europe 
international revenue increased as a percentage of total revenue in the year ended december   primarily due to the general economic slowdown  which has been exacerbated by the impact of the september   terrorist attack in the united states 
all of our revenue and accounts receivable are denominated in us dollars 
although seasonality affects many of our target markets  to date our revenues and financial condition as a whole have not been materially impacted by seasonality 
the development of emerging communications standards and technological change have influenced and are likely to continue to influence our quarterly and annual revenue and results of operations 
our product development and marketing strategies are focused on working closely with the promoter companies and communications standards groups to gain early access to new communications standards and technologies 
we have invested significantly in the research and development and marketing of our products for emerging communications standards  often before these standards have gained widespread industry acceptance and in advance of generating substantial revenue related to these investments 
additionally  the rate and timing of customer orders may vary significantly from month to month 
accordingly  if sales of our products do not occur when we expect and we are unable to predict or adjust our estimates on a timely basis  our expenses may increase as a percentage of revenue 
the overall economic environment continues to create uncertainties for us and our customers 
we have experienced continuing weakness in each of our business segments over the last year as a result of slowing growth in the global economy and delays in orders as a result of reduced spending by many of our customers  which has been exacerbated by the september   terrorist attack 
our near term financial results have been and may continue to be affected by our decision to accelerate sales  marketing and research and development spending in results of operations the following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the periods indicated as a percentage of revenue years ended december  consolidated statement of income data revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of deferred stock based compensation total operating expenses income loss from operations other income  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss results of operations in the year ended december    and revenue 
our revenue was million in the year ended december   million in the year ended december   and million in the year ended december  these amounts represent a decrease of from to and an increase of from to the decrease in revenue from to was due primarily to decreases in our sales of certain development products  production products and connectivity products of million  million and million  respectively  offset by increases in sales of our new and other development products  which represented million 
the decrease in sales from existing development and production products was the result of a general economic slowdown  primarily in the united states  and the decrease in sales of connectivity products was primarily the result of softness in the broadband internet access market  and additional competitive pressure due to improved availability of next generation cable and dsl modems with integrated usb support 
the increase in revenue from to was due primarily to sales of our new development products  which represented million  and continued sales of existing products with increases from representing million 
revenue from international customers represented of our revenue in the year ended december   of our revenue in the year ended december   and of our revenue in the year ended december  cost of revenue and gross profit 
our gross profit was million in the year ended december   million in the year ended december   and million in the year ended december  these amounts represent a decrease of from to and an increase of from to the dollar decrease in gross margin from to was primarily the result of a decrease in unit sales of development  production and connectivity products  offset by a decrease in amortization of deferred stock based compensation of  the dollar increase in gross margin from to was primarily the result of an increase in unit sales of development  production and connectivity products  offset by an increase in amortization of deferred stock based compensation of  our gross margin percentage was in the year ended december   in the year ended december   and in the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin from to was primarily due to reduced margins for our production products  due to higher costs associated with lower volume manufacturing  and for our connectivity products  due to competitive pricing pressure  partially offset by a change in the mix of our revenue by business segment 
our lower margin business segments  production products and connectivity products  decreased as a percentage of revenue by and  respectively  and our higher margin business segment  development products  increased as a percentage of revenue by 
the increase in gross margin from to was due primarily to the change in our revenue by business segment  with our higher margin business segment  development products  increasing by partially offset by our lower margin business segment  connectivity products  which increased by 
excluding amortization of deferred stock based compensation  our gross margin would have been for the year ended december   for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  research and development 
our research and development expenses were million in the year ended december   million in the year ended december   and million in the year ended december  these amounts represent increases of from to  and from to research and development expenses represented of revenue in the year ended december   of revenue in the year ended december   and of revenue in the year ended december  the dollar increase in was primarily due to an increase in personnel and related costs of million  as we continued to invest in our research and development team for the future 
the percentage of revenue increase in was primarily due to the impact of the decrease in revenue from and an increase in personnel and related costs 
the dollar increase in was primarily due to an increase in personnel and related costs of  and an increase in outside services and supplies cost of  the percentage of revenue decrease in was due to revenue growth of approximately over the same period 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses were million in the year ended december   million in the year ended december   and million in the year ended december  these amounts represent increases of from to  and from to sales and marketing expenses represented of the revenue for the year ended december   of revenue in the year ended december   and of revenue in the year ended december  the dollar increase in was primarily due to increases in personnel and related costs of approximately  as we continued to invest in our sales and marketing infrastructure for the future 
the percentage of revenue increase in was primarily due to the impact of the decrease in revenue from and an increase in personnel and related costs 
the dollar increase in was primarily due to increases in personnel and related expenses of  and increases in marketing programs of  the percentage of revenue increase in was primarily due to increases in personnel and marketing programs 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses were million in the year ended december   million in the year ended december   and  in the year ended december  these amounts represent increases of from to  and from to general and administrative expenses represented of revenue in the year ended december   of revenue in the year ended december   and of revenue in the year ended december  the dollar increase in was primarily due to an increase in professional services expense of  primarily legal and accounting fees  an increase in insurance of  primarily for directors and officers liability insurance premiums  and the addition of management and administrative personnel and related costs of  the percentage of revenue increase in was primarily due to the impact of the decrease in revenue from and an increase in professional services expense  an increase in insurance premiums and the addition of management and administrative personnel related costs 
the dollar increase in was primarily due to the addition of management and administrative personnel and related expenses of  and the increase in professional services expense of  the percentage of revenue increase in was primarily due to an increase in personnel and professional services expense 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation was million in the year ended december   of which  was included in cost of revenue during that period 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation was million in the year ended december   of which  was included in cost of revenue during that period 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation was million in the year ended december   of which  was included in cost of revenue during that period 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation includes adjustments of compensation expenses for unvested shares subsequently forfeited 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation on grants prior to december   is estimated to be approximately   and  in the years ending december   and  respectively  and may change due to the granting of additional options or the cancellation of existing grants in future periods 
other income 
other income was million in the year ended december    in the year ended december   and  in the year ended december  these amounts represent increases of from to  and from to these increases resulted from interest income earned on the investment of the additional excess cash balances and the proceeds from our initial public offering in november during september  we transferred the majority of our excess cash balances from money market funds to tax exempt and tax advantaged cash equivalents and short term investments in commercial paper  investment quality corporate bonds  collateralized mortgage obligations  and us government agency securities 
provision benefit for income taxes 
benefit for income taxes was  in the year ended december   and the provision for income taxes was million in the year ended december   and million in the year ended december  these amounts represent a decrease of from to  and an increase of from to our effective tax rate decreased from in to in due primarily to an increase in the amortization of deferred stock based compensation offset by an increase in our expected research and development tax credit 
our effective tax rate increased from in to in due to an increase in our income before provision for income taxes and before amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
our effective tax rate after excluding the effect of amortization of stock based compensation was in the year ended december   in the year ended december   and in the year ended december  the effective tax rate for is significantly less than the statutory federal and state rates due primarily to the effect of the research and development credits on a reduced level of taxable income 
net income loss 
our net loss was million in the year ended december   and our net income was million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  our net loss represented of revenue in the year ended december   and our net income represented of revenue in the year ended december   and of revenue in the year ended december  the decrease in net income in was primarily the result of reduced revenue and increased operating costs  offset by the benefit for income taxes and increased interest income 
the decrease in net income in was primarily the result of an increase in the amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
net income before the effect of the amortization of deferred stock based compensation was million in the year ended december   million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended these amounts represent a decrease of from to  and an increase of from to liquidity and capital resources our operating cash flow requirements have generally increased reflecting the expanding scope and level of our activities 
since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through cash flows from operating activities 
in november  we received net proceeds of million from the initial public offering of our common stock 
in the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities of  was primarily a result of net loss of million  offset by amortization of deferred stock based compensation of million  depreciation expenses of  and a decrease in related assets and liabilities for working capital purposes of million 
cash used in investing activities was million  related to capital expenditures of  and the purchase of short term investments of million  offset by the proceeds from the sale of short term investments of million and an increase in certain other assets of  cash provided by financing activities was  related to the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  and to the sale of stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan of  in the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities of million primarily consisted of net income of million  amortization of deferred stock based compensation of million  depreciation expense of  issuance of common stock for services of  and an increase in related assets and liabilities for working capital purposes of  cash used in investing activities was million  primarily related to purchases of short term investments of  and capital expenditures of  cash provided by financing activities of million related to million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in conjunction with our initial public offering and  received from the exercise of stock options 
in  cash provided by operating activities of million primarily consisted of net income of million and amortization of deferred stock based compensation of million  offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million 
cash used in investing activities of  related to capital expenditures 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  working capital of million and no debt 
at that date  we had no capital lease obligations  and we had future minimum lease payments under our operating leases of approximately  we believe that the net proceeds from our initial public offering in november  together with funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
thereafter  we may find it necessary to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
if we are required to raise additional funds  we may not be able to do so on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  if we issue new securities  stockholders might experience dilution or the holders of the new securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for certain obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the provisions of sfas no 
are required to be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after june  we believe the adoption of the provisions of this statement will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after september  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
we believe that the adoption of sfas will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after march  sfas requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles 
we believe that the adoption of sfas will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is required to be applied starting with years beginning after december  sfas requires  amongst other things  the application model for long lived assets that are impaired or to be disposed of by sale 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
as of december   cash equivalents and short term investments consist principally of investments in commercial paper  investment quality corporate bonds  collateralized mortgage obligations  us government agency securities and money market funds 
risk factors we continue to face uncertainty relating to economic conditions affecting our customers 
we face uncertainty in the degree to which the current economic slowdown will continue to negatively affect growth and capital spending by our existing and potential customers 
we continue to experience instances of customers delaying or deferring orders for our products  and longer lead times needed to close our customer sales 
if global economic conditions do not improve  or if there is a worsening in the global economic slowdown  we may continue to experience adverse impacts on our business  operating results and financial condition 
any adverse developments relating to the economic slowdown may make the occurrence of one or more of the factors discussed under risk factors in this report more likely to occur 
the recent terrorist attacks are unprecedented events that have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may harm our business and prospects and our ability in general to conduct business in the ordinary course 
terrorist attacks in new york and washington  dc in september have disrupted commerce throughout the world 
the continued threat of terrorism and the resulting military  economic and political response and heightened security measures may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world 
to the extent that this disruption results in a general decrease in our customers spending  our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we are unable to predict whether the threat of terrorism or the responses thereto will result in any long term commercial disruptions or if such activities or responses will have a long term adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
these and other developments arising out of the attacks may make the occurrence of one or more of the factors discussed under risk factors in this report more likely to occur 
our future operating results are unpredictable and are likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and  if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price would likely decline significantly 
our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors  some of which are wholly or partially outside of our control 
many of these risks are described in the following risk factors 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
some of the factors that could cause our quarterly or annual operating results to fluctuate include the amount and timing of our operating expenses and capital expenditures  changes in the volume of our product sales and pricing concessions on volume sales  the timing  reduction  deferral or cancellation of customer orders or purchases  seasonality in some of our target markets  the effectiveness of our product cost reduction efforts  variability of our customers product lifecycles  changes in the average selling prices of our products  and cancellations  changes or delays of deliveries to us by our manufacturers and suppliers 
if our operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline significantly 
if we fail to keep up with rapid technological change and evolving industry standards  our products could become less competitive or obsolete 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
our products may cease to be competitive if we fail to introduce new products or product enhancements that address these changes  meet new customer requirements and support new standards 
to continue to introduce new products or product enhancements on a timely basis  we must identify emerging technological trends in our target markets  including new communications standards  accurately define and design new products or product enhancements to meet market needs  develop or license the underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and product enhancements  and respond effectively to technological changes and product introductions by others 
if we are unable to identify  develop  manufacture  market or support new or enhanced products successfully or on a timely basis  our competitors could gain market share or our new products or product enhancements might not gain market acceptance 
further  we might not be able to respond effectively to product announcements by competitors  technological changes or emerging industry standards 
we depend upon widespread market acceptance of our usb products  and our revenue will decline if the market does not continue to accept these products 
we currently derive a substantial majority of our revenue from sales of our usb products 
revenue from sales of our usb products accounted for approximately of our revenue in the year ended december  we expect that revenue from these products will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
if the market does not continue to accept our usb products  our revenue will decline significantly 
factors that may affect the market acceptance of our current usb products include the continued growth of the markets for usb compliant devices as well as the performance and pricing of our usb products and the availability  functionality and price of competing products 
companies must also modify their products to support new versions of usb as they are developed  such as usb many of these factors are beyond our control 
in addition  in order to maintain widespread market acceptance  we must continue to differentiate ourselves from the competition through our technical expertise  product offerings and brand name recognition 
failure of our usb products to maintain market acceptance would adversely impact our revenue 
if we devote resources to developing products for communications standards that ultimately are not widely accepted  our business could be harmed 
we may incur significant expenses and dedicate significant time and resources in developing products for emerging communications standards that may not gain broad acceptance 
for example  we spent four years from to developing products for the access 
bus technology  a standard designed to connect peripheral devices to computers  which did not gain market acceptance 
the failure of a standard for which we devote resources to gain widespread acceptance  or our failure to be first to market with products that address a particular standard  would likely harm our business 
if we fail to maintain and expand our relationships with the core or promoter companies in our target markets  we may have difficulty developing and marketing our products 
it is important to our success to maintain and expand our relationships with companies that are leaders in developing new communications standards in our target markets 
we believe that we need to work closely with these core or promoter companies to gain valuable insights into the market demands for new products  to obtain early access to new communications standards as they are developed and to help us design new products 
we will need to maintain our relationships with leading technology and infrastructure companies  as well as expand our relationships with leaders in markets that are new for us 
generally  we do not enter into formal contracts that obligate these companies to work or share their technology with us 
industry leaders could choose to work with other companies as they develop new communications standards in the future 
if we fail to maintain and expand our industry relationships  we could lose the opportunity for first mover advantage with respect to emerging standards and it would be more difficult for us to develop and market products that address these standards 
if our target markets do not accept our products for emerging communications standards  our revenue growth could suffer 
our future growth depends upon our ability to sell advanced verification systems and connectivity products for emerging communications standards such as bluetooth wireless technology  infiniband and series ata 
however  our products may not gain widespread acceptance by customers 
the success of our products depends upon volume production of computer  communications and consumer electronic products that use a particular standard and the acceptance of these products by consumers 
the markets for emerging standards products have only recently begun to develop and are rapidly evolving 
as a result  it is difficult to predict their potential size or future growth rate 
there is significant uncertainty as to whether these markets ultimately will develop at all or  if they do develop  whether they will develop rapidly 
if the markets for a particular emerging communications standard fail to develop or develop more slowly than expected  or if our products do not achieve widespread market acceptance by customers in these markets  our business would be significantly harmed 
delays in the development of new products or product enhancements could harm our operating results and our competitive position 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and highly skilled engineering and development personnel  as well as accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
although we have not experienced any material product development delays in the past  these types of delays could occur in the future 
to the extent that we do not introduce the first product for an emerging standard or customers defer or cancel orders with the expectation of a new product or product enhancement release  our operating results could suffer 
product development delays may result from numerous factors  including changing product specifications and customer requirements  difficulties in hiring and retaining necessary technical personnel  difficulties in allocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations  difficulties with contract manufacturers or suppliers of key components  changing market or competitive product requirements  and unanticipated engineering complexities 
if we are unable to meet the design and market introduction schedules for our new products or product enhancements  our operating results and competitive position may suffer 
variations in our revenue may cause fluctuations in our operating results 
we may experience a delay in generating or recognizing revenue for a number of reasons 
historically  we have had little backlog and our revenue in any quarter has depended upon orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
furthermore  our customers may delay scheduled delivery dates and cancel orders without significant penalty 
in addition  even if we ship orders  generally accepted accounting principles may require us to defer recognition of revenue from those orders until a later date 
because we budget our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses is fixed in the short term  any delay in generating forecasted revenue could have a significant negative impact on our operating results 
shifts in our product mix may result in declines in gross margins 
our gross margins vary among our products  with our gross margins generally being higher on our advanced verification systems than on our connectivity products 
our overall gross margins might fluctuate from period to period as a result of shifts in product mix  the channels through which we sell our products  the introduction of new products and product costs 
decreases in average selling prices of our products may reduce gross margins and revenue 
the average selling prices of our products may decrease in the future in response to product introductions or enhancements by us or our competitors  or as a result of other factors  including discounts given on volume purchase orders or pricing pressures 
for example  we recently reduced the prices of certain of our connectivity products in response to competitive pricing pressure 
we anticipate that we will need to continue to develop and introduce on a timely basis new products that incorporate features that can be sold at higher average selling prices 
failure to do so would likely cause our revenue and gross margins to decline 
continued competition in our markets may lead to a reduction in our prices  revenue and market share 
the markets for advanced verification and connectivity products for emerging communications standards are highly competitive 
we compete with multiple companies in various markets  including yokagawa in the markets for products for the standard  tektronix in the markets for products for the bluetooth wireless technology and finisar in the markets for products for the infiniband standard 
any of our competitors may develop technologies that address our targeted markets more effectively and at a lower cost 
in addition  these competitors may enter into strategic alliances or business combinations that increase their ability to innovate and address our markets 
we may also face competition from other equipment manufacturers  such as agilent  national instruments and rhode schwartz 
many of these companies have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and distribution resources and brand name recognition than we have 
we expect that more companies  including some of our customers  will enter our markets 
if these companies develop products that compete with our products or form alliances with or acquire companies offering competing products  even if those products do not have capabilities comparable to our products  they would be significant competitors and their activities could cause us to reduce our prices 
increased competition could result in significant price erosion  reduced revenue  lower margins and loss of market share  any of which would significantly harm our business 
we depend on contract manufacturers for substantially all of our manufacturing requirements and if these manufacturers fail to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products  our competitive position  reputation and business could be harmed 
we currently rely on four contract manufacturers for all of our manufacturing requirements except for the final assembly  testing and quality assurance on our lower volume  higher margin products 
we do not have long term contracts with any of these manufacturers 
as a result  our manufacturers could refuse to continue to manufacture all or some of our products that we require or change the terms under which they manufacture our products 
we have experienced delays in product shipments from some of our contract manufacturers in the past  which in turn forced us to delay product shipments to our customers 
we may in the future experience similar delays or other problems  such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of products  any of which could significantly harm our business 
our contract manufacturers may not be able to meet our future requirements for timely delivery of products of sufficient quality and quantity 
we intend to introduce new products and product enhancements regularly  which will require that we rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating our efforts with those of our suppliers and contract manufacturers 
the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products or the loss of any of our contract manufacturers would cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer 
if we are unable to forecast our supply needs accurately  our costs may increase or we may not be able to ship products in a timely manner 
we purchase components used in the manufacture of our products from several key sources 
we depend on these sources to deliver necessary components in a timely manner based on twelve month rolling forecasts that we provide 
lead times for materials and components that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as specific supplier requirements  contract terms and current market demand for particular components 
if we overestimate our component requirements  we may develop excess inventory  which would increase our costs 
if we underestimate our component requirements  we may not be able to fulfill customer orders 
we depend on sole source suppliers for several key components of our products  and we may lose sales if they fail to meet our needs 
we obtain some parts  components and packaging used in our products from sole sources of supply 
for example  we obtain field programmable gate array integrated circuits from altera  asics from lsi logic through wyle electronics  certain bluetooth components from ericsson  semiconductor devices from agilent  and micro controllers from intel  smsc and cypress semiconductor 
if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for sole source components at reasonable costs and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or the price for an alternative source is prohibitive  our ability to maintain timely and cost effective production of our products would be harmed 
in addition  because we rely on purchase orders rather than long term contracts with our suppliers  including our sole source suppliers  we cannot predict with certainty our ability to obtain components in the longer term 
if we are unable to obtain components or receive a smaller allocation of components than is necessary to manufacture products in quantities sufficient to meet demand  customers could choose to purchase competing products 
if our distributors and resellers manufacturer s representatives do not actively sell our products  our product sales may decline 
we sell a substantial portion of our products through distributors and resellers manufacturer s representatives  including toyo  our distributor in japan  which accounted for approximately of our revenue in the year ended december  our distributors and resellers manufacturer s representatives generally offer products from multiple manufacturers 
accordingly  there is a risk that these distributors and resellers manufacturer s representatives may give higher priority to selling products from other suppliers and reduce their efforts to sell our products 
our distributors and resellers manufacturer s representatives may not market our products effectively or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales  marketing and technical support 
our distributors may on occasion build inventories in anticipation of substantial growth in sales and  if growth does not occur as rapidly as anticipated  may decrease the quantity of products ordered from us in subsequent quarters 
a slowdown in orders from our distributors could reduce our revenue in any given quarter and give rise to fluctuations in our operating results 
in addition  our sales to toyo and our other distributors are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than a long term commitment 
the loss of any one of our major distributors  or the delay of significant orders from these distributors  could result in decreased revenue 
if we are unable to hire and retain additional sales  marketing  engineering  operations and finance personnel  our growth will be impaired 
to grow our business successfully and maintain a high level of quality  we will need to recruit  retain and motivate additional highly skilled sales  marketing  engineering  operations and finance personnel 
if we are not able to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  our growth will be impaired 
in particular  as a company focused on the development of complex products  we will need to hire additional hardware and software developers and engineers and project managers of various experience levels in order to keep pace with technological change and develop products that meet the needs of rapidly evolving markets 
competition for skilled employees  particularly in the san francisco bay area  is intense 
we may have even greater difficulty recruiting potential employees if prospective employees perceive the equity component of our compensation package to be less valuable as a result of market fluctuations in the price of our common stock 
the loss of key management personnel  on whose knowledge  leadership and technical expertise we rely  would harm our ability to execute our business plan 
our success depends heavily upon the continued contributions of our key management personnel  whose knowledge  leadership and technical expertise would be difficult to replace 
all of our executive officers and key personnel are employees at will 
we maintain no key person insurance on any of our personnel 
if we were to lose the services of any of our key personnel and were unable to hire qualified replacements  our ability to execute our business plan would be harmed 
in addition  employees who leave our company may subsequently compete against us 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our business could suffer 
our ability to offer products and implement our business plan successfully in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
we increased our headcount by in the year ended december  we expect that our headcount will continue to increase in future periods and that we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial controls  reporting systems and procedures 
for example  we are in the process of migrating our operations to a new enterprise resource planning system that affects almost every facet of our business operations 
typically  these conversions negatively affect a company s near term ability to conduct business due to problems such as historical data conversion errors  personnel training time associated with the new system  delays in implementation or unforeseen technical problems during conversion 
if problems arise during this transition  we could experience delays in or lack of shipping  an inability to support our existing customer base  delays in paying vendors  delays in collecting from customers  an inability to place or receive product orders or other operational problems 
if this were to occur  our profitability or financial position could be negatively impacted 
if we are not able to manage our growth effectively and efficiently  the quality of our products  our ability to retain key personnel and our operating results could suffer 
our products may contain defects that cause us to incur significant costs  divert our attention from product development efforts and result in a loss of customers 
highly complex products such as our verification systems and connectivity products frequently contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are released 
although none of our products has contained any material defects in the past  our products may contain defects of this nature in the future 
if any of our products contains defects or have reliability  quality or compatibility problems  our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products 
as a result  our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers could be harmed 
in addition  these defects could interrupt or delay sales to our customers 
we may have to invest significant capital and other resources to alleviate these problems 
if any of these problems remains undiscovered until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product  we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall  repair or replacement costs 
these problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others 
in addition  these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts 
if we are unable to expand our direct sales operations and our distributor and reseller manufacturer s representatives channels or successfully manage our expanded sales organization  our ability to increase our revenue will be harmed 
historically  we have relied on a limited direct sales organization  supported by third party resellers manufacturer s representatives  to sell our products domestically and on third party distributors to sell our products internationally 
we intend to develop and expand our direct sales organization in north america and our indirect distribution channels internationally 
we may not be able to expand our direct sales organization successfully  and the cost of any expansion may exceed the revenue generated from expansion 
in addition  if we fail to develop relationships with significant distributors or resellers manufacturer s representatives  or if our current distributors or resellers manufacturer s representatives are not successful in their sales or marketing efforts  sales of our products may decrease 
any acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value and harm our operating results 
we expect to review opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products  expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities or that might otherwise offer growth opportunities 
if we make any future acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders  incur substantial debt or assume contingent liabilities 
to date  we have not acquired any other business or technologies 
potential acquisitions also involve numerous risks  including problems in assimilating the purchased operations  technologies or products  costs or accounting charges associated with the acquisition  diversion of management s attention from our existing business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of purchased businesses 
economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our sales 
because we sell our products worldwide and have a research and development facility in israel  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
we recognized of our revenue from sales to international customers in the year ended december  we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue 
in addition  several of our manufacturers facilities and suppliers are located outside the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in emerging markets  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  differing labor regulations  differing protection of intellectual property  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
our headquarters and our contract manufacturers are located in northern california  asia and other areas where natural disasters may occur 
currently  our corporate headquarters and some of our contract manufacturers are located in northern california and our other contract manufacturers are located in asia 
northern california and asia historically have been vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks  such as earthquakes  fires  floods  power loss and telecommunication failure  which at times have disrupted the local economy and posed physical risks to our and our manufacturers properties 
we also maintain facilities in san diego  california and netanya  israel 
we do not have redundant  multiple site capacity in the event of a natural disaster 
any failure to protect our intellectual property adequately may significantly harm our business 
to date  we protect our proprietary processes  software  know how and other intellectual property and related rights through copyrights  trademarks and maintenance of trade secrets  including entering into confidentiality agreements 
our success and ability to compete depend in part on our proprietary technology 
we currently do not have any patents 
although we have six patents pending  patents may not issue as a result of these or other patent applications 
any patents that ultimately issue may be successfully challenged by others or invalidated  or may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage 
third parties may breach confidentiality agreements or other protective contracts into which we have entered  and we may not be able to enforce our rights in the event of these breaches 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights  including pursuing remedies in court 
we may become involved in legal proceedings against other parties  which may also cause other parties to assert claims against us 
we report material pending legal proceedings  if any  under the separate caption item legal proceedings elsewhere in this report 
however  in the future  we may not be able to detect infringement and may lose competitive position in our markets before we do so 
in addition  competitors may design around our technologies or develop competing technologies 
the laws of other countries in which we market our products might offer little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology 
reverse engineering  unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it  which could significantly harm our business 
claims that we infringe third party intellectual property rights could result in significant expenses or restrictions on our ability to sell our products 
our industry is characterized by uncertain and conflicting intellectual property claims and frequent intellectual property litigation  especially regarding patent rights 
to date  we have not received any letters  and we do not have any other reason to believe  that our products infringe any other party s intellectual property rights 
however  we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
historically  patent applications in the united states have not been publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  and we may not be aware of filed patent applications that relate to our products or technology 
if patents are later issued in connection with these applications  we may be liable for infringement 
from time to time  other parties may assert patent  copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies and in various jurisdictions that are important to our business 
any claims asserting that our products infringe or may infringe proprietary rights of third parties  including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers  regardless of their merit or resolution  would likely be costly and time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations could impede the sale of our products 
in the united states  substantial portions of the telecommunications industry  we and many of our customers and their products are subject to regulations and standards set by the federal communications commission  or fcc 
internationally  many of our customers and their products may also be required to comply with regulations established by authorities in various countries 
we are required to determine to what extent our products may be subject to fcc standards and regulations and to what extent we are required to obtain authorizations from the fcc directly or from a third party authorized by the fcc to issue such authorizations 
we are also required to maintain in good standing any equipment authorization we receive from the fcc or an fcc approved party 
in addition  the regulations in force both in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions may change 
failure to comply with regulations established by regulatory authorities or to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates could significantly harm our business 
an energy crisis in california may cause our operating results to suffer 
california has encountered  and may again encounter  an energy crisis that could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
suppliers of electric power have on some occasions implemented  and may in the future continue to implement  rolling blackouts throughout california 
we currently do not have backup generators or alternate sources of power in the event of a blackout  and our current insurance does not provide coverage for any damages our customers or we may suffer as a result of any interruption in the power supply 
if blackouts interrupt our power supply  we would be temporarily unable to continue operations at our facilities in california 
any such interruption in our ability to continue operations at our facilities could damage our reputation  harm our ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new customers  and result in lost revenue  any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations
