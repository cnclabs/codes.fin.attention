we are the world s largest operator  franchisor and licensor of convenience stores and the largest convenience store chain in north america 
our revenue principally consists of merchandise and gasoline sales and  to a lesser extent  royalty income from licensees 
our primary expenses consist of cost of goods sold  operating  selling  general and administrative expense  occupancy  interest expense and taxes 
management strategy overview over the last several years  we have refined our business strategy to take advantage of our widely recognized brand and to leverage our size  technology and people 
in  we will accelerate investment in our traditional convenience store business and our key growth initiatives in order to improve our competitive position and financial results in and beyond 
our primary focus in will be in the following areas introducing new or improved products and services at our stores  growing and improving our existing store base  enhancing our retail information system  developing our people  and improving administrative efficiencies 
introducing new or improved products and services at our stores the financial services business continues to be one of our priorities 
recognizing our customers needs for convenient and continuously available financial services  we developed vcom  our proprietary self service kiosk that offers check cashing  money order  money transfer and traditional atm services 
we are currently operating a store vcom pilot program in texas and florida 
upon successful completion of the pilot program  we anticipate beginning deployment of additional vcom kiosks to our stores in the second half of with up to  kiosks deployed by the end of our fresh food business is a key component of our long term growth strategy 
we are improving the quality of our fresh food offering  introducing new menu items and new packaging and leveraging the brand equity in our big gulp  big bite and big brew brands 
in february  we began a pilot program of new  higher quality products under the brand name big eats  and we expect to introduce additional pilot markets in the second quarter 
if pilot results are successful  we would expect to begin a rollout of the big eats brand to all of our stores that are serviced by a combined distribution center 
additionally  we will promote our fresh foods through radio and television advertising and updated point of purchase displays 
growing and improving our existing store base we plan on opening between and new stores during we intend to focus this expansion on our existing markets to leverage our infrastructure and maximize the efficiencies of our network of combined distribution centers 
in addition  during we plan on improving our existing store base by spending an estimated million for capital expenditures related to the maintenance and replacement of store equipment 
enhancing our retail information system in  we plan to accelerate our capital spending on information technology to approximately million 
we will apply most of this spending to enhance our proprietary retail information system in order to reduce administrative work for our store operators and improve their future productivity 
these enhancements will automate the verification of product delivery from vendors and process vendor invoices electronically 
we plan to add labor scheduling and job assignment tools that will save time  create more accountability and permit store operators to plan a consistent and organized work flow 
enhanced automation will also improve our system of store cash reporting and the processes for reconciling lottery reports and completing shift changes 
these actions will save store managers time and improve the accuracy of store cash reports 
we expect these initiatives to contribute to reduced shortages in both cash and inventory in the future 
developing our people we recognize that employees and franchisees are critical to our success 
as such  we have designed and developed new training programs that we plan to implement in our new staffing model will clearly define a store employee s career path and require mandatory certification of certain skills in order to be promoted 
after completing computerized training at our stores  employees will be tested and certified 
in addition  our field consultants  a position that supports a group of about eight eleven stores  will undergo a rigorous training program to ensure they are fully able to manage as well as train key aspects of store operations 
we have also strengthened our hiring process by utilizing additional screening tools and new pay scales to improve employee and franchisee recruitment and selection 
we recently launched a new jobs line to increase applicant flow 
we plan to introduce an incentive program that grades and rewards successful execution of the five fundamentals of our business product assortment  quality  service  cleanliness and value 
through these initiatives  we believe we can improve the knowledge and skills of our store operators  increase sales and lower turnover  all of which will improve the operating performance of our stores 
improving administrative efficiencies we also believe we can improve efficiency through process improvements 
in  we hired seasoned executives with expertise in logistics and procurement to assist us in reducing our costs in these two areas 
we have a new centralized procurement department with a focus on standardizing procurement procedures company wide  provide a more disciplined approach to the competitive bidding process and aggressively negotiate terms with our vendors 
in addition  we are studying other administrative areas of the company with the objective of lowering our level of administrative costs 
other business issues cost reductions 
we are constantly evaluating our operating performance to improve our financial results 
as part of a continuing effort to lower operating expenses  we undertook a comprehensive review in of our corporate  field and distribution infrastructure as well as our store base 
as a result of this review  we are closing underperforming stores  consolidating one division and reducing corporate staff 
in the first quarter of  we committed to and carried out a plan that eliminated approximately positions 
as a result  our first quarter results will include a million pretax charge to operating  selling  general and administrative osg a expenses for severance costs 
we plan to optimize our store base by closing underperforming stores and opening new stores in strategic locations 
in the first quarter of  we committed to a plan to close between and underperforming stores in we recorded an asset impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of related to these stores 
in the first quarter of  we will record a pretax charge of million to osg a primarily for anticipated future rent for these stores and other expenses in excess of the income we expect to derive from subleasing them 
during  we also plan to open to new stores 
see management strategy overview growing and improving our existing store base 
we expect to realize an annual pretax operating earnings benefit of million due to our cost reduction efforts 
we will not realize the full amount of this annual benefit  however  until we intend to initiate and continue other cost reductions to improve operating earnings such as standardized procurement procedures and negotiating a new distribution services agreement with favorable terms 
royalty payment reduction 
we have a license agreement with seven eleven japan under which seven eleven japan pays us a royalty fee based upon a percentage of its total revenues 
in  we monetized this yen royalty stream and amended our license agreement with seven eleven japan 
the monetization enabled us to repay million of debt 
the amendment to the license agreement will reduce seven eleven japan s royalty payments to us by approximately beginning in august this reduction will decrease our seven eleven japan royalty receipts by approximately million in compared to our seven eleven japan royalty receipts will decrease in by approximately million compared to we do not anticipate any further reductions in the amount of the license fee percentage

distribution services 
our ten year distribution services agreement with mclane company  inc expires in november we are currently discussing with numerous wholesale companies  including mclane  the possibility of providing distribution services to our us stores after our mclane agreement expires 
see liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and commercial commitments distribution services 
new accounting standards 
we are adopting two new required accounting standards in that will have a significant impact on our reported results of operations 
effective january   we will adopt statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
adopting sfas no 
means we will no longer amortize goodwill and certain intangible assets 
this will result in an annual reduction in amortization expense of approximately million beginning in effective january   we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which for our purposes relates to the accounting for costs associated with future removal of underground gasoline tanks 
this adoption will result in a one time  cumulative effect after tax charge of approximately million and reduce our earnings before cumulative effect charge by approximately million 
we intend to record the cumulative charge in the first quarter of see other issues recently issued accounting standards and note to the consolidated financial statements 
lease renewals 
we lease approximately two thirds of our  us and canadian store locations 
over the next five years  about half of these leases expire or will require renegotiation of the rental rates 
beginning in  we will devote considerable energies to extending and or renegotiating these leases 
see liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and commercial commitments financial obligations store leases 
the combination of the above factors is expected to cause pressure on our earnings 
critical accounting policies and estimates estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
franchisees we consolidate all merchandise sales and cost of goods sold from stores operated by franchisees with the results of company operated stores 
we split the merchandise gross profit of franchise stores between our franchisees  who generally receive of the gross profit  and ourselves 
our share of the merchandise gross profit of franchise stores represents the ongoing franchise fee 
in addition  for gasoline sales  our franchisees receive the greater of one cent per gallon sold or of gasoline gross profit as compensation for services they perform related to gasoline 
the franchisees share of the merchandise and gasoline gross profit is presented as franchisee gross profit expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings 
if we did not consolidate the franchisee merchandise revenues and cost of goods sold into our consolidated financial results  our net earnings would not change  our consolidated statement of earnings  however  would not reflect any franchise gross profit expense and would reflect significantly lower merchandise revenues and cost of goods sold 
instead  our share of the earnings from franchised stores would be reflected as other income in our consolidated statement of earnings 
we include the franchise stores merchandise sales and cost of sales in our financial statements because we believe that we retain a more significant financial and merchandising advisory role in the franchise business than is present in most other franchisor franchisee relationships 
for example  unlike most franchise models  we own or lease the stores and equipment used by the franchisees as well as provide accounting and merchandising services  among others 
due to this significant level of involvement and our retention of certain business risks associated with the ownership or leasing of franchised locations and the equipment used by franchisees  we believe that our financial statement presentation appropriately reflects the substance of this combined economic relationship 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
environmental we accrue for the estimated future costs related to remediation activities at existing and previously operated gasoline storage sites and other operating and non operating properties where releases of regulated substances have been detected 
our estimates of the anticipated future costs for remediation activities at such sites are based upon our prior experience with remediation sites and consideration of factors such as the condition of the site contamination  location of tank sites and our experience with contractors who perform environmental assessment and remediation work 
we determine the reserve on a site by site basis and record a liability for remediation activities when it is probable that corrective action will be taken and the cost of the remediation activities can be reasonably estimated 
a portion of the environmental expenditures we incur for remediation activities is eligible for reimbursement under state trust funds and reimbursement programs 
a receivable is recorded for estimated probable refunds when the related liability is recorded 
the amount of the receivable is based upon our historical collection experience with the specific state fund or other state funds  the financial status of the state fund and our priority ranking for reimbursement from the state fund 
we discount the receivable if the amount relates to remediation activities that have already been completed 
the estimated future remediation expenditures and related state reimbursement amounts could change as governmental requirements and state reimbursement programs continue to be implemented or revised 
such revisions could have a material impact on our operations and financial position 
see other issues environmental and note to the consolidated financial statements 
store closings and asset impairment we write down property and equipment of stores we are closing to estimated net realizable value at the time we commit to a plan to close such stores 
if we lease the store  we will also accrue for related future estimated rent and other expenses if we believe the expenses will exceed estimated sublease rental income 
we base the estimated net realizable value of property and equipment on our experience in utilizing and or disposing of similar assets and on estimates provided by our own and or third party real estate experts 
we also use our experience in subleasing similar property to estimate future sublease income 
if there is a significant change in the real estate market  our net realizable value estimates and or our estimated future sublease income could change materially 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
yen loans we use the seven eleven japan license royalty receipts to service the monthly principal and interest payments on our outstanding yen loans 
this provides us with an economic hedge against fluctuations in the japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate 
effective january   sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  nullified the hedge accounting treatment we were previously applying to the seven eleven japan royalty and yen loans 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a one time charge of million  net of taxes  related to the cumulative effect of the adoption of sfas no 
accordingly  since january   we have adjusted the balance of the yen loans at each reporting date to reflect the current japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate  and the resultant foreign currency exchange gain or loss is recognized in earnings 
in addition  we record the seven eleven japan royalty and interest expense on the yen loans at the average japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate for the respective periods 
our reported results include pretax non cash transaction gains of million associated with the adjustment of our yen loan balance to reflect the current japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate 
future changes in the japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate will continue to result in non cash transaction gains or losses 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks foreign exchange risk management and note to the consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is generally determined by the last in  first out lifo method for company operated stores in the united states and by the first in  first out fifo method for stores in canada 
although the lifo method generally matches the most recent product cost with related revenues  decreases in inventory quantities can result in a liquidation of lifo inventory layers recorded at costs that are lower than the current costs  which would lower cost of goods sold and increase our margin 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
workers compensation and general liability reserves we have third party insurance for workers compensation and general liability losses  with predetermined deductibles 
we record our share of workers compensation and general liability losses based upon independent actuarial estimates of the aggregate liabilities for claims incurred 
a significant change in claims experience or in the criteria which the actuary utilizes could result in a material revision to our liability 
off balance sheet lease financing we utilize an off balance sheet lease financing program to diversify our funding sources for new store growth 
in and  we entered into lease financing programs for constructing new stores and acquiring operating convenience stores from third parties not affiliated with us 
under these programs  we do not include the costs incurred in constructing or acquiring the stores or any related financing obligations in our consolidated balance sheets 
if we were to account for the stores covered under these programs as owned assets or capital leases  our balance sheet would include the costs incurred in constructing the stores or acquiring the operating convenience stores and any related financing obligations

merchandise gross profit for increased million  or  over as a result of higher sales  partially offset by a decline in gross profit margin to from the prior year s 
our overall gross profit margin and gross profit growth per store decline was due to a combination of wholesale cost increases  changes in product mix and the impact of cigarette cost increases 
some of our faster growing product categories were cigarettes  prepaid cards  beer and fresh foods  all of which are traditionally lower margin products 
our strategy of maintaining competitive everyday fair prices in the face of increasing wholesale costs has resulted in lower margins in some cases 
aggressive pricing by competitors for items such as bread  milk  cigarettes and soft drinks has also decreased our margin 
these factors will continue to put pressure on our merchandise gross profit margin  however  we anticipate that our merchandise gross profit margin will improve in through aggressive monitoring of our retail pricing and continued efforts to reduce our cost of goods sold 
gasoline gross profit for increased million  or  over primarily due to increased sales volume 
gasoline gross profit margin improved to cents per gallon for compared to cents per gallon in our gasoline gross profit per store increased from in part because of wholesale costs declining more quickly than retail prices during the second half of and our management of retail gasoline prices 
we manage retail gasoline prices through a centralized monitoring process to minimize the effect of gasoline margin volatility and maximize our gross profit per gallon 
increases or decreases in the wholesale cost of gasoline will generally cause similar increases or decreases in the retail price of gasoline 
an increase in the wholesale cost of gasoline generally results in higher retail prices within five to ten days after the cost increase 
conversely  a decrease in the wholesale cost of gasoline generally results in lower retail prices within to days after the cost decrease 
competitive conditions in the retail marketplace can cause these time periods to vary considerably on a market by market basis  which can have a significant impact on gasoline gross profit margin 
over the last nine years  however  our gasoline gross profit margins have ranged from to cents per gallon on an annual basis

in addition  we intend to continue accessing the leasing market to finance our new stores and certain equipment  including potentially vcom kiosks 
we expect capital expenditures for  excluding lease commitments  will be between million and million 
this is an increase of million to million over capital expenditures in and is caused primarily by our accelerating some capital expenditures from to to facilitate enhancing our retail information system and upgrading our existing store base

based upon current expectations  including accelerated capital spending on our growth initiatives  our consolidated total indebtedness to ebitda ratio will exceed the maximum level allowed by the financial covenant in our revolving credit agreement

we believe the banks will grant us this covenant relief we are seeking  but we cannot make any assurances to that effect 
on february   moody s investor service announced it was placing our long term debt credit rating on review for possible downgrade 
our credit rating affects the terms of some of our existing debt instruments 
under these instruments  an upgrade in our credit rating will generally decrease the percentage of fees and interest we would otherwise be required to pay to our lenders 
conversely  a downgrade in our credit rating would generally increase the percentage of fees and interest we would otherwise be required to pay to our lenders 
additionally  under the indentures governing our public subordinated debentures  a downgrade in the credit rating of the debentures below investment grade would prohibit us from making certain payments  including dividends and stock repurchases 
we do not believe  however  that a ratings downgrade would prohibit us from continuing to issue commercial paper at our current rates because our commercial paper is currently guaranteed by ito yokado through nor do we believe that a ratings downgrade would affect our ability to draw down funds from our revolver  although in such an event the cost of obtaining such funds will increase 
if we receive a significant downgrade to our credit rating  it would be more difficult and expensive for us to access financing  and we could be forced to slow our growth initiatives 
in addition  a small number of our contractual vendor obligations would be affected  which may obligate us to issue letters of credit for the benefit of the vendors 
vcom vcom is our proprietary kiosk solution to meet consumer demands for convenient and continuously available financial and e commerce services 
we believe that the deployment of these web enabled  integrated services kiosks represents a significant market opportunity to offer financial and e commerce services to a large segment of our current and future customers who have little or no access to banks or the internet 
we find that we are particularly well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity because of the demographics of our existing customer base and the large number of our conveniently located stores

through exclusive agreements with third party service providers  we currently offer or plan to offer atm services american express co  money order and money transfer services western union financial services  inc  check cashing services certegy inc 
and telecommunications services verizon select services  inc 
we estimate that our capital investment for vcom will total between million and million by mid upon successful completion of the vcom pilot program  we will move forward with our plans for a national rollout 
a commitment to a national rollout will require us to make a significant investment 
we currently estimate that we will need up to million to finance and install  vcom kiosks beginning in the second half of and continuing through in addition  we estimate that we will need approximately million to fund the amount of cash in the kiosks necessary for check cashing and atm transactions 
we have had substantive discussions with financial institutions about providing funding for vcom  and we reasonably expect such funds to be available to us 
we anticipate that vcom will be cash flow positive beginning in primarily as a result of placement fees from our strategic partners 
these funds will be recognized as revenue when earned by the incurring of specified expenses  installation of equipment  sale of products or the passage of time  all as specified by the substance of the applicable agreement 
we estimate that we will incur cumulative pretax losses during the and roll out period of up to million 
we expect vcom to be profitable in and beyond 
in exchange for our granting strategic partners exclusive rights to offer their services or products on our vcom kiosks  they will pay us placement fees  a percentage of the transaction fees and  in certain circumstances  expense reimbursement 
as of december   we have received approximately million of placement fee commitments from our strategic partners  although most of such commitments are funded as vcom kiosks are deployed 
in  we received million in such fees  of which we recognized million as an offset to the costs associated with the vcom pilot program in osg a expense and  in other income 
as of december   the remaining million of fees received has not been recognized in earnings and is included in deferred credits and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
with the exception of fees associated with pilot program funding  which are amortized over the term of the pilot program  we will amortize substantially all placement fee income over the term of the applicable agreement

capital lease obligations 
we utilize capital leases as a means of funding our property and equipment 
generally  real estate leases are for primary terms from to years with options to renew for additional periods  and equipment leases are for terms of one to ten years 
these obligations and related assets are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
operating lease obligations 
we also lease a substantial portion of our property and equipment using traditional operating leases 
generally  real estate leases are for primary terms up to years with options to renew for additional periods and equipment leases are for terms from one to ten years 
these obligations and related assets are not included in our consolidated balance sheet 
off balance sheet lease financing program 
in  we entered into a lease facility that provided us with million in off balance sheet financing that we used for constructing new stores and acquiring operating convenience stores from third parties not affiliated with us 
under the agreement  a trust funded by a group of senior lenders either acquired land and undertook construction projects for which we were the construction agent or acquired operating convenience stores from third parties 
as the construction agent  we handled all of the day to day issues involved in constructing any new store built by the trust under this facility 
after a store was constructed or acquired  the trust leased the store to us for an amount equal to the interest expense on the applicable store s construction costs or  in the case of operating convenience stores  the acquisition price of the land  building  motor fuels equipment and other fixtures  at london interbank offer rate libor plus 
the base lease term under this facility expires in february  and as of december   the trust had funded million from this facility 
in january  we entered into an additional lease facility that provides up to million of off balance sheet financing with substantially the same terms as the facility 
the rent expense on stores constructed or purchased with money from this facility equals the interest expense on the applicable store s construction costs or  in the case of operating convenience stores acquired from third parties  the acquisition price of the land  building  motor fuels equipment and other fixtures  at libor plus 
the base lease term under this facility expires in july as of december   the trust had funded million of the million facility 
after the initial lease term has expired under each lease facility agreement  we have the option of negotiating an extension of the lease  purchasing all properties for an amount approximating the trust s interest in such properties  which is equal to the total amount of funds advanced by the trust  or vacating the properties  arranging for the sale to a third party and paying the trust the net proceeds from the sale 
if the sale proceeds are less than the trust s interest in the properties  we are required to reimburse the trust for the deficiency  although our reimbursement obligation is limited to of the trust s interest in the properties 
if the sale proceeds exceed the trust s interest in the properties  we are entitled to all of such excess amounts 
the leases  which we account for as operating leases  contain financial and operating covenants similar to those under our revolving credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the trusts are substantive entities in which a major financial institution is the primary equity holder 
we have no management control or equity interest in the trusts  and we have no contingent obligation other than guaranteeing of the trust s interest in the properties in the event that we vacate and sell at a loss to third parties 
we do not intend to use this type of financing program in the future and will instead rely on other sources to fund future expansion 
store leases 
as of december   we operated a total of  stores in the united states and canada 
we own fewer than one third of these stores  and we lease the rest 
over the next five years  leases covering more than half of our total leased stores will expire  including more than  leases that lack rent renewal options or contain negotiable rent options and more than  leases that have fixed rent options 
total lease expiring or with negotiable rent options  fixed rent options  total  figures include leases expiring from march   through december  we originally signed many of the expiring leases  or leases with negotiable options  in the s and s 
some of these leases contained favorable rents for to year primary terms  with as many as three options to renew for additional five year terms 
for those sites where we need to negotiate a a new lease to replace an expiring lease or b new rent for those leases that have negotiable rent renewal options  we expect that we will pay prevailing market rates when the new lease term or option term commences  which will likely increase our operating costs 
if we are unable to agree on an appropriate rent  we may decide to forego renewal of the lease and close the store 
if we have a fixed rent option  in most cases the rent will increase either to a specific predetermined dollar amount or as calculated based upon a predetermined formula  such as an increase in the consumer price index 
these rent increases will increase our operating costs 
quids 
ito yokado and seven eleven japan hold million of quids from two separate transactions in million and million

revolving credit facility 
there was no funded debt outstanding under the revolver at december  letters of credit outstanding under the revolver totaled million at december   and reduced available funds under the revolver to million 
interest on borrowings are based upon a variable rate equal to the administrative agent bank s base rate or  at our option  a rate equal to a reserve adjusted eurodollar rate plus a margin determined by our credit rating for senior long term indebtedness 
our revolving credit facility contains various financial and operating covenants that require us  among other things  to maintain certain financial ratios  including interest and rent coverage and consolidated total indebtedness to earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the facility also contains covenants which  among other things  limit a our ability to incur or guarantee indebtedness or other liabilities other than under the facility  b our ability to engage in asset sales and sale leaseback transactions  c the types of investments we can make  and d our ability to pay cash dividends or redeem or prepay principal and interest on any subordinated debt 
the bank s funding obligations are contingent upon our financial operations 
if we suffer a material adverse change  the bank would not have to fund the facility 
we do not anticipate drawing down any funds under our revolver in the near future

purchase commitments 
we have various material contracts with service and product vendors  some of which were executed in the first quarter of  that contain commitments to purchase minimum levels of products or services 
we have estimated our material minimum purchase commitments as of december   and material commitments executed in the first quarter of these estimated commitments are summarized as follows in millions thereafter total distribution services   gasoline supply  it commitments product commitments total      we have estimated our future purchase commitments based upon volumes purchased and our average cost for adjusted annually by 
we have estimated our future purchase commitments based upon our contracted volume at prices 
distribution services 
in  we entered into a ten year distribution services agreement with mclane company  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of wal mart stores  inc  pursuant to which mclane is the primary distributor of traditional grocery products to our us stores 
in  we purchased in excess of billion in traditional grocery products from mclane  which represents over of all merchandise purchased for our stores last year 
these purchases satisfied our minimum purchase requirement under the agreement for  and we expect to continue satisfying this requirement until the contract s expiration in november we are currently discussing with numerous wholesale distribution companies  including mclane  the possibility of providing distribution services to our us stores upon the expiration of our current contract 
we believe that our future distribution services agreement  whether with mclane or another third party or parties  will be on terms more favorable than the those set forth in our existing agreement with mclane because of the increased competition in the marketplace with potential suppliers  the size of our current store base and the attractiveness of our growth strategy to a potential supplier 
gasoline supply 
we are currently in the th year of a year product purchase agreement with citgo petroleum corporation 
this agreement  which expires in september  permits us to purchase gasoline from parties other than citgo  but obligates us to purchase specified quantities of gasoline at market prices from citgo 
the minimum required annual purchases under this agreement are generally the lesser of million gallons or of all of the gasoline we purchased for retail sale 
we have exceeded the minimum required annual purchases in each year of the contract and expect to continue doing so in the future 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
it commitments 
we have various information technology commitments that require us to purchase minimum amounts of products and services annually 
we have exceeded such minimum purchase requirements in the past and expect to continue doing so for the foreseeable future 
our failure to satisfy the minimum purchase requirements could cause us to make payments to the applicable provider s equal to the commitment s or a predetermined percentage of the commitment s 
product commitments 
we have various product purchase contracts that require us to purchase a minimum amount of products annually 
we have exceeded such minimum purchase requirements in the past and expect to continue doing so for the foreseeable future 
our failure to satisfy the minimum purchase requirements could result in termination of the contracts  changes in pricing of the products and payments to the applicable provider s of a predetermined percentage of the commitment s which would not exceed million 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in we attribute this decrease to changes in balance sheet items  primarily as a result of timing of the funding for money orders  the timing of payment of merchandise payables  an increase in receivables for vendor promotional allowances and payment of a prior year legal settlement 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities in was million  an increase of million  or  from million in a portion of this increase is due to increased capital expenditures to million in from million in  primarily as a result of an increase in the number of new stores opened in compared to the net cash used in was offset by million of net proceeds from a sale leaseback transaction during capital expenditures for each of and were used for maintaining  remodeling and upgrading stores  developing new stores  enhancing our retail information system  purchasing new equipment to support merchandising initiatives and complying with environmental regulations

see management strategy overview other business issues royalty payment reduction and note to the consolidated financial statements 
expansion in china 
during the third quarter of  we announced plans to expand the development and operation of eleven stores in the people s republic of china through licensing arrangements 
there are currently approximately eleven stores in hong kong and eleven stores in the south china province of guangdong 
those stores are operated by subsidiaries of dairy farm international ltd 
pursuant to a licensing arrangement 
subject to obtaining the approvals referenced below  we are evaluating the possibility of entering into a licensing arrangement for at least one additional market area in china with seven eleven japan  president chain store corporation and a local chinese participant 
president chain store corporation is our current licensee in taiwan where it operates approximately  eleven stores  and seven eleven japan is our current licensee in japan where it operates approximately  eleven stores 
we have focused on the possibility of negotiating a licensing arrangement with seven eleven japan and president chain store corporation because of their financial strength  business experience in china and proven ability to develop and operate eleven stores 
we have not negotiated the final terms and conditions of the proposed licensing agreement 
we anticipate that the final license agreement will include the payment of a one time licensing fee  a store development schedule and obligation and a royalty on sales at the licensed stores 
based on the development experience of dairy farm in guangdong and our own preliminary projections for the development of additional stores in china  we do not expect that the licensing of additional market areas in china will have any material impact on our royalty revenue for several years 
because we anticipate entering into a licensing arrangement with seven eleven japan  which together with ito yokado owns of our common stock  our board of directors has appointed a special committee comprised of three independent directors to review and consider the proposed licensing arrangement for approval 
our board has authorized the special committee to retain whatever external resources are necessary to obtain objective advice regarding the proposed licensing arrangement 
environmental at december   our estimated undiscounted liability for our environmental costs related to remedial action at existing and previously operated gasoline storage sites and other operating and non operating properties where releases of regulated substances have been detected was million 
we anticipate that substantially all of the future remediation costs for detected releases of regulated substances at remediation sites of which we are aware  as of december   will be incurred within the next five to six years 
the estimated liability could change for several reasons  including revisions to or the creation of governmental requirements  existing remediation projects become fully defined and cost to closure estimates become available  and unplanned future failures of underground gasoline storage tank systems 
under state reimbursement programs  we are eligible to be reimbursed for a portion of remediation costs previously incurred 
at december   we had recorded a net receivable of million for the estimated state reimbursements of which million relates to remediation costs incurred in california 
in assessing the probability of state reimbursements  we take into consideration each state s fund balance  revenue sources  existing claim backlog  historical payments and claim ranking systems 
as a result of these assessments  the recorded receivable amounts  at december   are net of allowances of million 
the estimated future state reimbursement amounts could change as governmental requirements and state reimbursement programs continue to be revised or extended 
our estimated reimbursement amounts could change materially as remediation costs are spent and as receipts of state trust funds are recorded 
while we cannot be certain of the timing of our receipt of state reimbursement funds  based upon our experience we expect to receive the majority of state reimbursement funds within one to three years after our payment of eligible remediation expenses 
this time period assumes that the state administrative procedures for processing such reimbursements have been fully developed 
one exception to our assumption is california  where we estimate that we will receive reimbursement funds within one to ten years after our payment of eligible remediation expenses 
as a result of the timing for reimbursements  we have present valued the portion of the recorded receivable amount that relates to remediation activities that have already been completed at a discount rate of approximately 
thus  in addition to the allowance set forth in the preceding paragraph  the recorded receivable amount is also net of a discount of million 
the estimated future remediation expenditures and related state reimbursement amounts could change as governmental requirements and state reimbursement programs continue to be implemented or revised 
such revisions could have a material impact on our operations and financial position 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  we closed our chemical manufacturing facility in new jersey 
we are required to conduct environmental remediation at the facility  including groundwater monitoring and treatment  which commenced in we have recorded undiscounted liabilities  representing our best estimates of the cleanup costs  of million at december  the estimated reserve could change as governmental requirements change 
in  we entered into a settlement agreement with the former owner of the facility pursuant to which the former owner agreed to pay a substantial portion of the cleanup costs 
based upon the terms of the settlement agreement and the financial resources of the former owner  we have a receivable recorded of million at december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discussion summarizes the financial and derivative instruments we held as of december  these instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
we use interest rate swaps to manage the primary market exposures associated with underlying liabilities and anticipated transactions 
we use these instruments to reduce risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures 
in addition  our two yen denominated loans effectively serve as an economic hedge of our exposure to yen dollar currency fluctuations resulting from our significant yen based royalty from seven eleven japan 
we do not leverage the instruments we hold  and we hold the instruments for purposes other than trading 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable  such as country risk  credit risk and legal risk  and we have not addressed these risks in this discussion 
interest rate risk management the table below presents descriptions of the floating rate financial instruments and interest rate derivative instruments we held at december  we entered into interest rate swaps to achieve the levels of variable and fixed rate debt approved by senior management 
under the interest rate swaps  we agreed with other parties to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts on a quarterly basis 
the table below presents the principal cash flows by maturity date for our floating rate debt and the related estimated average interest rate 
for the interest rate swaps  the table presents the notional amounts outstanding and expected interest rates that exist by contractual dates 
we used the notional amount to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract  and we estimated the variable rates based upon implied forward rates in the yield curve as of december  dollars in millions thereafter total fair value floating rate financial instrument commercial paper average interest rate interest rate derivatives notional amount average pay rate average receive rate see liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and commercial commitments long term debt 
the negative million fair value of the interest rate swap represents an estimate of the amount we would pay if we had chosen to terminate the swap as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   approximately of our debt contained floating rates that will be impacted by changes in interest rates 
we have effectively eliminated of our exposure to variable rates in a rising rate environment through the interest rate swap agreement 
the weighted average interest rate for such debt  including the impact of the interest rate swap agreement  was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  foreign exchange risk management approximately million of our royalty income in was impacted by fluctuating exchange rates  including approximately million from seven eleven japan 
although sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  nullified the hedge accounting treatment we were applying to the seven eleven japan royalty and our yen denominated loans  we continue to have an economic hedge by using the seven eleven japan royalty receipts to make principal and interest payments on our yen denominated loans 
since january   we have adjusted the balance of the yen loans at each reporting date to reflect the current japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate  and the resulting foreign currency exchange gain or loss is recognized in earnings 
based upon our yen denominated debt balance as of december   a one point increase or decrease in the japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate would result in an increase or decrease in pretax earnings of approximately million 
see critical accounting policies and estimates yen loans and notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we are exposed to fluctuating exchange rates on the portion of our royalties earned in foreign currencies that are not attributable to our license agreement with seven eleven japan  but we do not believe future risk is material based upon current estimates 
we also have several wholly or partially owned foreign subsidiaries and are susceptible to exchange rate risk on earnings from these subsidiaries  based upon current estimates  however  we do not consider future foreign exchange risk to be material 
equity price risk management we hold equity securities of other companies 
we classify these securities as available for sale and carry them on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
at december   we held  shares of affiliated computer services  inc common stock the acs shares  which had no cost basis but had a fair value of million 
we obtained the acs shares in as part of our mainframe data processing contract with acs 
at that time  acs was a privately held start up company 
accordingly  the stock was valued with no cost 
changes in fair value are recognized as other comprehensive earnings  net of tax  as a separate component of shareholders equity
