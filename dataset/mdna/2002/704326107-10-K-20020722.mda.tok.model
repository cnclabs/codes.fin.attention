item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk factors interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short term funds and available for sale debt securities  whereas corporate investments are primarily comprised of available for sale debt securities 
the company s available for sale debt securities are exposed to interest rate risk as interest rate volatility will cause fluctuations in the market value of held investments and the earnings potential of future investments 
increases in interest rates normally decrease the market value of the available for sale securities  while decreases in interest rates increase the market value of the available for sale securities 
the company s available for sale securities and short term funds are exposed to earnings risk from changes in interest rates  as rate volatility will cause fluctuations in the earnings potential of future investments 
increases in interest rates quickly increase earnings from short term funds  and over time increase earnings from the available for sale securities portfolio 
decreases in interest rates have the opposite earnings effect on the available for sale securities and short term funds 
earnings from the available for sale securities do not reflect changes in rates until the investments are sold or mature  and the proceeds are reinvested at current rates 
the immediate impact of changing interest rates on earnings from short term funds may be temporarily offset by realized gains or losses from transactions in the company s available for sale portfolio 
the company directs investments towards high credit quality  tax exempt securities to mitigate the risk that earnings from the portfolio could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates in the near term 
the company invests in short to intermediate term  fixed rate municipal and government securities  which typically have lower interest rate volatility  and normally manages the securities portfolio to a benchmark duration of to years 
the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
the trend in market interest rates during the second half of fiscal and the first half of fiscal has been interest rate reductions 
the following table summarizes the changes in the federal funds rate over the last three fiscal years federal funds rate beginning of fiscal year rate increase decrease first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter federal funds rate end of fiscal year three year aaa municipal securities yields at may 
table of contents calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  daily interest rate changes  seasonal variations in investment balances  actual duration of short and intermediate term investments  the proportional mix of taxable and tax exempt investments  and changes in tax exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates  which are not synchronized or simultaneous 
subject to these factors  a basis point change generally affects the company s tax exempt interest rates by approximately basis points 
the total investment portfolio is expected to average approximately billion in fiscal the company s normal and anticipated allocation is approximately invested in short term securities with a duration of less than days and invested in intermediate term municipal securities with an average duration of three years 
the company estimates that the earnings effect of a basis point change in interest rates basis points for tax exempt investments at this point in time would be approximately million for fiscal the combined funds held for clients and corporate available for sale investment portfolios reflected unrealized gains of million at may  and million at may   compared with unrealized losses of million at may  during fiscal  the unrealized gain position ranged from approximately million during the fourth quarter to million during the second quarter 
as of may  and may   the company had billion and billion  respectively  invested in available for sale securities at fair value  with weighted average yields to maturity of and  respectively 
assuming a hypothetical increase in both short term and intermediate term interest rates of basis points  the resulting potential decrease in fair value for the portfolio of securities at may  would be approximately million 
conversely  a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in fair value 
this hypothetical decrease or increase in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio s recorded value  with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders equity  and with no related or immediate impact to the results of operations 
credit risk the company is exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds 
the company attempts to limit credit risk by investing primarily in aaa and aa rated securities and a rated short term securities  and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single instrument 
at may   approximately of the available for sale securities held an aa rating or better  and all short term securities classified as cash equivalents held an a or equivalent rating
