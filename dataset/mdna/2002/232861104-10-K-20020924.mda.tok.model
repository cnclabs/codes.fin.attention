percentage change from prior percentage of net sales year net sales gross profit total operating expenses income from operations interest expense  net other  net nm nm income tax provision minority interest na na net income fiscal year ended june   compared with the fiscal year ended june  net sales net sales increased million to billion  or  for the fiscal year ended june   compared to the corresponding period of the prior year 
sales growth was primarily in the independent and regional pharmacy and national pharmacy chain groups 
sales to independent and regional pharmacies increased million to billion  or  as a result of the net increase in sales to existing customers  the addition of dhi for a full year  and the addition of new customers 
national pharmacy chain sales increased million to billion  or  over fiscal as proceeds from our equity offering were primarily used to capitalize on opportunities in this trade class  while sales to healthcare providers increased million to million  or 
the increase in net sales related to the consolidation of pbi in fiscal was insignificant 
we made replenishment purchases and investment purchases  including both forward purchasing and special purchasing opportunities  with our largest supplier for fiscal we continue to make replenishment and forward purchases  but do not anticipate any special purchasing opportunities in the near future  with this supplier 
if we are unable to identify and benefit from other purchasing opportunities  then there could be a negative impact on our revenues and earnings in future periods 
in addition  during fiscal we made million in dock to dock sales  which are not included in net sales due to our accounting policy of recording only the commission on such transactions as a reduction to cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
dock to dock sales represent bulk sales of pharmaceuticals to self warehousing chain pharmacies for which we act only as an intermediary in the order and subsequent delivery of products to the customers warehouses 
the commission on dock to dock sales is typically lower than the gross profit realized on sales of products from inventory 
dock to dock sales were million during fiscal gross profit gross profit increased million to million  or  for fiscal  compared to the corresponding period of the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross margin increased from to for the fiscal year ended june   compared to the corresponding period of the prior year 
the slight increase in gross margin percentage was due to the inclusion of pbi partially offset by competitive forces in the business and a slightly higher mix of national pharmacy chain business that normally has lower gross margins 
operating expenses operating expenses including depreciation and amortization increased million to million  or  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the corresponding period of the prior year 
the ratio of operating expenses to net sales for fiscal was  a decrease from the comparable period of the prior year 
the increase in operating expenses resulted from the inclusion of dhi and pbi operating expenses during the year  a shift in sales mix to accounts requiring a higher level of service  and higher depreciation expense related to portions of the new erp system being implemented 
the ratio of operating expense to net sales fell as a function of the increase in sales in national pharmacy business that has lower incremental operating costs 
interest expense  net net interest expense decreased million to million  or  for the fiscal year ended june   compared to the corresponding period of the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  net interest expense decreased to from for fiscal  compared to the corresponding period of the prior year 
the decrease in net interest expense was primarily the result of lower average borrowing rates 
income tax provision our effective income tax rate was for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the corresponding period of the prior year 
these rates were different from the statutory blended federal and state rates primarily because of the amortization of intangible assets that are not deductible for federal and state income tax purposes 
our effective rate is slightly higher than the corresponding period of last year due to the impact of the sales mix on the blended state income tax rate 
minority interest we began recording minority interest during fiscal as a result of our additional investment in pbi in july prior to fiscal  our investment was treated under the equity method and our portion of the earnings in pbi where recorded accordingly 
fiscal year ended june   compared with the fiscal year ended june  net sales net sales increased million to billion  or  for the fiscal year ended june   compared to the corresponding period of the prior year

national pharmacy chain sales increased million to million  or  over fiscal due to infrastructure investments and a focused effort on this trade class  while sales to healthcare providers decreased million to million  or  as a result of the loss of two mail order customers during the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  during fiscal we made million in dock to dock sales  which are not included in net sales due to our accounting policy of recording only the commission on such transactions as a reduction to cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
dock to dock sales represent bulk sales of pharmaceuticals to self warehousing chain pharmacies for which we act only as an intermediary in the order and subsequent delivery of products to the customers warehouses 
the commission on dock to dock sales is typically lower than the gross profit realized on sales of products from inventory

as a percentage of net sales  gross margin increased from to for the fiscal year ended june   compared to the corresponding period of the prior year 
the increase in gross margin percentage was due to the discontinuance of lower gross profit business from the mail order customers mentioned above 
operating expenses operating expenses including depreciation and amortization increased million to million  or  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the corresponding period of the prior year 
the ratio of operating expenses to net sales for fiscal was  an increase from the comparable period of the prior year 
the increase in operating expenses and the ratio of operating expenses to net sales resulted primarily from a shift in sales mix to accounts requiring a higher level of service and related expense

as a percentage of net sales  net interest expense increased to from for fiscal  compared to the corresponding period of the prior year

income tax provision our effective income tax rate was for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the corresponding period of the prior year 
these rates were different from the statutory blended federal and state rates primarily because of the amortization of intangible assets that are not deductible for federal and state income tax purposes 
our effective rate is slightly higher than the corresponding period of last year due to the impact of the sales mix on the blended state income tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital requirements are generally met through a combination of internally generated funds  borrowings under the revolving line of credit  the accounts receivable securitization program  and trade credit from our suppliers 
on july   stockholders equity was increased by approximately million as the result of our secondary stock offering 
see note of our consolidated financial statements 
we use the following ratios as key indicators of our liquidity and working capital management june  june  working capital s   current ratio to to working capital and current ratio at june  are higher than june  levels 
increases in inventory levels are related to seasonal sales patterns and growth that have been partially offset by accounts payable increases tied to timing of inventory receipts and related payments 
we invested million in capital assets in fiscal  as compared to million in the corresponding period in the prior year 
the fiscal and expenditures were primarily related to the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning computer system  which is scheduled to be completed during fiscal this system integrates sales order management  inventory management  transportation management  customer service  accounts payable  accounts receivable  general ledger and financial reporting 
we believe that continuing investment in capital assets is necessary to achieve our goal of improving operational efficiency  thereby enhancing our productivity and profitability 
net cash inflows from financing activities totaled million for the year ended june  as compared to net cash outflows of million for the corresponding period in the prior year 
during fiscal  we received proceeds from our secondary stock offering that was partially offset by increased repayments under our revolving credit agreement 
during the previous year  the capacity under our accounts receivable securitization program increased which made available funds for repayment of the revolving credit facility 
on june   our revolving line of credit was amended to increase the maximum borrowing capacity to million and extend the term to august under the loan agreement  the total amount of loans and letters of credit outstanding at any time may not exceed the lesser of an amount based on percentages of eligible inventories the borrowing base formula  or our maximum borrowing capacity under this agreement but may not be less than million 
the advances currently bear interest at a base rate of the london interbank offering rate libor plus  or at the prime rate plus per annum payable monthly 
through an interest rate swap agreement  we effectively fixed the interest rate on million of our revolving line of credit at a nominal rate of 
at june  and june   the borrowing base formula amounted to million and million  respectively 
the unused portion of the line of credit amounted to million at june  and million at june  the agreement expires in august  and  therefore  the related debt has been classified as long term 
the revolving line of credit is secured by eligible inventories 
in july  our revolving line of credit was amended to increase the maximum borrowing capacity to million 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into an accounts receivable securitization program under an asset securitization structure with our primary lender 
on june   this agreement was amended to increase the maximum amount of receivables eligible to be sold to million and the term was extended to august at june   million of this facility was utilized 
under the program  undivided interests in a pool of eligible trade receivables that have been contributed to the seller are sold  without recourse  to a multi seller  asset backed commercial paper conduit conduit 
purchases by the conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper 
we use the proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable to repay long term debt  effectively reducing its overall borrowing costs 
funding costs under this program are on the first million with the rate on the excess amounts equal to the commercial paper rate 
certain program fees total an additional 
the portion of receivables not sold by the subsidiary remains an asset on the balance sheet million as of june  
in august  this agreement was amended to increase the maximum amount of receivables eligible to be sold to million 
stockholders equity increased to million at june  from million at june   due to the impact of the equity offering and net earnings during the period 
we believe that funds available under the line of credit and the securitization facility  together with internally generated funds  will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
inflation our financial statements are prepared on the basis of historical costs and are not intended to reflect changes in the relative purchasing power of the dollar 
because of our ability to take advantage of forward purchasing opportunities  we believe that our gross profits generally increase as a result of manufacturers price increases in the products we distribute 
gross profits may decline if the rate of price increases by manufacturers declines 
generally  price increases are passed through to customers as they are received by us and therefore reduce the negative effect of inflation 
other non inventory cost increases  such as payroll  supplies and services  have been partially offset during the past three years by increased volume and productivity 
recent trends during the first two months of the fiscal first quarter  the company s internal revenue and margin objectives for its national chain business were not achieved 
the sales shortfall is principally the result of fewer than expected purchasing and sales opportunities available during the period 
the company s sales in the national chain business have been variable from month to month historically  driven largely by opportunistic purchases from pharmaceutical companies for distribution primarily to national chains 
additionally  the company s growth in sales to the independent and regional pharmacy trade class has trended below internal expectations in the first two months of the quarter of fiscal the company now expects this trade class to achieve growth of approximately  year over year  in the first quarter 
while below expectations  this performance should enable the company to further expand its share of this trade class  despite the unusually strong growth it achieved in the year ago first quarter 
the company believes its sales performance in the trade class reflects a recent softening in retail sales trends now being exhibited across the country 
the company also believes the retail sales trends reflect a greater than expected revenue impact from generic drugs encroachment on branded pharmaceuticals  the impact of increasingly higher prescription co payment costs as well as funding challenges across most state medicaid systems 
critical accounting policies the company s more critical accounting policies include the accounts receivable securitization program  the valuation of long lived assets  and the use of estimates which inherently involve judgment and uncertainties in valuing accounts receivable 
accounts receivable securitization program the company and its wholly owned  bankruptcy remote subsidiary seller has an accounts receivable securitization program 
under the program  undivided interests in a pool of eligible trade receivables that have been contributed to the seller are sold  without recourse  to a multi seller  asset backed commercial paper conduit conduit 
purchases by the conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper 
the company utilizes proceeds from the sale of its accounts receivable to repay long term debt  effectively reducing its overall borrowing costs 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  as amended by sfas no 
the securitization transactions have been recorded as sales  with those accounts receivable sold to the conduit removed from the consolidated balance sheet 
the seller is a separate legal entity from the company 
the seller s assets are available first and foremost to satisfy the claims of its creditors 
eligible receivables  as defined in the securitization agreement  consist of trade receivables from our subsidiaries  excluding non pharmaceutical receivables  reduced for certain items  including past due balances and concentration limits 
of the eligible pool of receivables contributed to the seller  undivided interests in only a portion of the pool are sold to the conduit 
the portion of eligible receivables not sold to the conduit remains an asset of the seller 
the seller s interest in these receivables is subordinate to the conduit s interest in the event of default under the securitization agreement 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and certain identifiable intangibles assets are reviewed when events or circumstances indicate that the net book value may not be recoverable 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers  including reviews of their current credit information  and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the company s historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
however  the ultimate collectibility of a receivable is dependent upon the financial condition of an individual customer  which could change rapidly and without advance warning 
new accounting standards the financial accounting standards board has issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under the purchase method and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
sfas is effective for all business combinations completed after june  see note of our consolidated financial statements 
the financial accounting standards board has issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the new standard  we will no longer be required or permitted to amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives reflected on the balance sheet 
we will  however  be required to evaluate these items reflected on the balance sheet to determine whether they are impaired under the guidelines of the standard 
other intangible assets with definite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we adopted sfas no 
as of july  as a result of this adoption  the company will recognize an impairment loss of approximately million million net of tax during the first quarter of fiscal this will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
this impairment results from an appraisal valuation and relates to goodwill originally established for the acquisition of jewett drug co 
the earnings per share impact of goodwill amortization during fiscal was per share 
the financial accounting standards board has issued sfas no 
 asset retirement obligations in june sfas provides guidance on accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and associated retirement costs 
we adopted this statement in fiscal  and it did not affect our consolidated financial position 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas  accounting for long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas establishes a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
we are in the process of evaluating the adoption of this standard  but do not believe it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement updates  clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements related to accounting for gains and losses from the extinguishments of debt and accounting for certain lease modifications 
we are in the process of evaluating the adoption of this standard  but do not believe it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses the accounting for costs associated with disposal activities covered by sfas no 
or with exit activities previously covered by eitf this statement will be applied prospectively to any exit or disposal activities that we initiate after december item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates on borrowings 
an increase in interest rates would adversely affect the operating results and the cash flow available to fund operations and expansion 
based on the average variable borrowings  a change of basis points in the average variable borrowing rate would result in a change of approximately million in annual interest expense 
we continually monitor this risk and review the potential benefits of entering into hedging transactions  such as interest rate swap agreements  to mitigate the exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
our hedging arrangements at june  are described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements
