item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative small molecule drugs for improving cancer treatments 
small molecule drugs  in general  are non protein products produced by chemical synthesis rather than biologic methods 
our lead compound  rsr generic name efaproxiril sodium  is a synthetic small molecule that increases the release of oxygen from hemoglobin  the oxygen carrying protein contained within red blood cells 
the presence of oxygen in tumors is an essential element for the effectiveness of radiation therapy and some chemotherapy agents in the treatment of cancer 
by increasing tumor oxygenation  rsr has the potential to enhance the efficacy of standard radiation therapy and certain chemotherapeutic drugs 
unlike chemotherapeutics or other radiosensitizers  rsr does not have to cross the blood brain barrier and enter the tumor for efficacy 
we believe rsr can be used to improve existing cancer treatments and treat many diseases and clinical conditions attributed to or aggravated by oxygen deprivation 
deprivation of oxygen in the body is called hypoxia 
we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and clinical development 
we have not derived any commercial revenues from product sales  and we do not expect to receive product revenues until at least we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of  there can be no assurance if or when we will become profitable 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses over the next several years as we continue to incur increasing research and development costs  in addition to costs related to clinical trials and manufacturing activities 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
our achieving profitability depends upon our ability  alone or with others  to successfully complete the development of our product candidates  and obtain required regulatory clearances and successfully manufacture and market our future products 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and expenses research and development 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  excluding the impact of non cash charges comprising amortization of deferred compensation and stock expense see non cash charges below  research and development expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the  or  increase from to was due primarily to increased clinical trial costs associated with our first phase iii clinical trial of rsr and the additional headcount required to support this trial 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in as we continue our phase iii study and begin several additional phase ii clinical trials of rsr the  or  increase in research and development spending from to was due primarily to additional headcount and administration costs to complete several phase ii clinical trials 
clinical manufacturing 
clinical manufacturing expenses include the cost of manufacturing rsr for use in clinical trials and costs associated with the scale up of manufacturing to support commercial requirements 
clinical manufacturing expenses for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
the  or  decrease in compared to primarily resulted from decreased consulting and formulation expenses 
the  or  increase in compared to primarily resulted from increased costs incurred in manufacturing more bulk drug substance and drug product for our clinical trials 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
excluding the impact of non cash charges comprising amortization of deferred compensation and stock compensation expense  see non cash charges below  general and administrative expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the  or  increase for compared to and the  or  increase in compared to  are both primarily the result of additional costs associated with being a public company  increased personnel costs and increased facility costs 
non cash charges 
we have recorded compensation charges resulting from certain options granted to employees prior to our march initial public offering with exercise prices below the fair market value of our common stock on their respective grant dates 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of   and  respectively 
of the  recorded for the year ended december    related to general and administrative   related to research and development and the remaining  related to clinical manufacturing 
of the  recorded for the year ended december    related to general and administrative   related to research and development and the remaining  related to clinical manufacturing 
of the  recorded for the year ended december    related to research and development and the remaining  related to general and administrative 
at december   the company had  of deferred compensation remaining to be amortized 
for the year ended december   we recorded stock compensation expense of  due to changes to the original terms of various grant agreements 
of this amount   related to general and administrative and the remaining  related to research and development 
for the year ended december   we recorded  in stock compensation expense in connection with the forgiveness of the notes as defined below 
of this amount   related to general and administrative and the remaining  related to research and development 
this compensation charge was a result of obtaining recourse notes receivable in march the notes from two officers in the amount of  upon the officers exercise of  stock options 
the notes accrued interest at annually with interest and principal originally due march in december  the maturity dates for the notes were extended by two years and extended by an additional year in january upon forgiveness of the notes in march  we recorded stock compensation expense based upon the difference between the fair market value of the underlying common stock and option exercise price 
in addition  we recorded  of compensation expense due to the extinguishment of the notes 
of this amount   related to research and development and the remaining  related to general and administrative 
for the year ended december   we recorded  in stock compensation expense in connection with the extension of the notes as defined below 
of this amount   related to general and administrative and the remaining  related to research and development 
this compensation charge was a result of obtaining recourse notes receivable in december the notes from two officers in the amount of  upon the officers exercise of  stock options 
the notes accrued interest at annually with interest and principal originally due december in january  the maturity dates for the notes were extended by one year and later paid in full 
we recorded stock compensation expense based upon the difference between the fair market value of the underlying common stock and option exercise price 
interest and other income  net interest income  net of interest expense  was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the  increase in as compared to and the  increase in as compared to were attributable to increased average investment balances from the proceeds of our initial public offering and higher yields on us government securities  high grade commercial paper and corporate notes and money market funds held by us 
income taxes as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards of  and  respectively  available to offset future regular and alternative taxable income 
these net operating loss carryforwards expire between and the research and development credit carryforwards will expire between and the utilization of the loss carryforwards to reduce future income taxes will depend on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards 
in addition  the maximum annual use of the net operating loss carryforwards is limited in certain situations where changes occur in our stock ownership 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of preferred stock and a public equity financing  which have resulted in net proceeds to us of  through december  since inception  we have used  of cash for operating activities 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were  at december   compared with  at december  and  at december  working capital at december  was  as compared to  at december   and  at december  long term debt was  and  for the years ending december  and  respectively 
there was no long term debt at december   which previously consisted primarily of capital equipment lease obligations 
net cash used in operating activities was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
uses of cash in operating activities were primarily to fund net losses  excluding non cash charges 
net cash provided by investing activities was  for the year ended december  and consisted primarily of proceeds from the maturities of short term investments  partially offset by the purchase of short term investments and property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  and consisted primarily of net purchases of investments and property and equipment 
net cash provided by investing activities was  for the year ended december  and consisted primarily of proceeds from the maturities of short term investments  partially offset by the purchase of short term investments and property and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended december  and consisted primarily of pledging collateral for the line of credit 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december  and consisted primarily of proceeds from our initial public offering 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  and consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale of preferred stock 
based upon the current status of our product development and commercialization plans  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs through at least the calendar year however  our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the status of product development  the time and cost involved in conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals  filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  and our ability to market and distribute our future products and establish new collaborative and licensing arrangements 
we may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through equity or debt financing  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources which may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
in addition  in the event that additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborative partners or other sources  such arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  product candidates or products under development that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures on market risk we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations 
all of these market risk sensitive instruments are classified as held to maturity 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio contains instruments that are subject to the risk of a decline in interest rates 
we maintain a non trading investment portfolio of investment grade  liquid debt securities that limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
we prepared sensitivity analyses of our interest rate exposures and our exposure from anticipated investment for fiscal to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
based on the results of these analyses  a adverse change in interest rates from the fiscal year end rates would not have a material adverse effect on the fair value of investments and would not materially impact our results of operations  cash flows  or financial condition for the next twelve months
