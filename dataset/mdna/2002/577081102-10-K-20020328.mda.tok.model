in addition to the important factors detailed herein and from time to time in other reports filed by mattel with the securities and exchange commission  including forms k  q and k  the following important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from past results or those suggested by any forward looking statements 
competition and new product introductions mattel s business and operating results depend largely upon the appeal of its toy products 
consumer preferences are continuously changing 
in recent years there have been trends towards shorter life cycles for individual products  the phenomenon of children outgrowing toys at younger ages particularly in favor of interactive and high technology products and an increasing use of high technology in toys 
in addition  mattel competes with many other companies  both large and small  which means that mattel s market position is always at risk 
mattel s ability to maintain its current market share  and increase its market share or establish market share in new product categories  will depend on mattel s ability to satisfy consumer preferences  enhance existing products  develop and introduce new products  and achieve market acceptance of such products 
if mattel does not successfully meet these challenges in a timely and cost effective manner  demand for its products will decrease and mattel s results of operations will suffer 
seasonality  managing production and predictability of orders mattel s business is subject to risks associated with the underproduction of popular toys and the overproduction of toys that do not match consumer demand 
sales of toy products at retail are seasonal  with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december 
as a result  mattel s annual operating results will depend  in large part  on sales during the relatively brief holiday season 
retailers are attempting to manage their inventories better  requiring mattel to ship products closer to the time the retailers expect to sell the products to consumers 
this in turn results in shorter lead times for production 
shortages of raw materials or components also may affect mattel s ability to produce products in time to meet retailer demand 
these factors increase the risk that mattel may not be able to meet demand for certain products at peak demand times  or that mattel s own inventory levels may be adversely impacted by the need to pre build products before orders are placed 
adverse general economic conditions mattel s results of operations may be negatively affected by adverse changes in general economic conditions in the us and internationally  including adverse changes in the retail environment 
these adverse changes may be as a result of softening global economies  wavering consumer confidence caused by the threat or occurrence of terrorist attacks such as those in the us on september   or other factors affecting economic conditions generally 
such changes may negatively affect the sales of mattel s products  increase exposure to losses for bad debt  or increase costs associated with manufacturing and distributing these products 
customer concentration a small number of mattel s customers account for a large share of net sales 
for the year ended december   mattel s three largest customers  wal mart  toys r us and target  in the aggregate accounted for approximately of net sales  and the ten largest customers in the aggregate accounted for approximately of net sales 
the concentration of mattel s business with a relatively small number of customers may expose mattel to a material adverse effect if one or more of mattel s large customers were to significantly reduce purchases for any reason 
in addition  some large chain retailers have begun to sell private label toys designed and branded by the retailers themselves 
such toys may be sold at prices lower than comparable toys sold by mattel  and may result in lower purchases of mattel branded products by such retailers 
rationalization of mass market retail channel and bankruptcy of key customers many of mattel s key customers are mass market retailers 
the mass market retail channel has experienced significant shifts in market share among competitors in recent years  causing some large retailers to experience liquidity problems 
in and  two large customers of mattel filed for bankruptcy 
mattel s sales to customers are typically made on credit without collateral 
there is a risk that customers will not pay  or that payment may be delayed  because of bankruptcy or other factors beyond the control of mattel 
this could increase mattel s exposure to losses from bad debts 
in addition  if these or other customers were to cease doing business as a result of bankruptcy  it could have a material adverse affect on mattel s business  financial condition and results of operations 
litigation and disputes mattel is involved in a number of litigation matters  including purported securities class action claims stemming from the merger with the learning company and the performance of the learning company division in the second half of an unfavorable resolution of the pending litigation could have a material adverse effect on mattel s financial condition 
the litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of mattel s management regardless of the outcome 
there can be no assurance that mattel will be able to achieve a favorable settlement of the pending litigation or obtain a favorable resolution of such litigation if it is not settled 
in addition  current and future litigation  governmental proceedings  labor disputes or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruptions of normal business operations of mattel 
protection of intellectual property rights the value of mattel s business depends to a large degree on its ability to protect its intellectual property  including its trademarks  trade names  copyrights  patents and trade secrets in the us and around the world 
any failure by mattel to protect its proprietary intellectual property and information  including any successful challenge to mattel s ownership of its intellectual property or material infringements of such property  could have a material adverse effect on mattel s business  financial condition and results of operations 
political developments  including trade relations  and the threat or occurrence of terrorist activities mattel s business is worldwide in scope  including operations in countries 
the deterioration of the political situation in a country in which mattel has significant sales or operations  or the breakdown of trade relations between the us and a foreign country in which mattel has significant manufacturing facilities or other operations  could adversely affect mattel s business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  a change in trade status for china could result in a substantial increase in the import duty of toys manufactured in china and imported into the us 
in addition  the occurrence or threat of terrorist activities  and the responses to and results of such activities  could materially impact mattel  its personnel and facilities  its customers and suppliers  retail and financial markets and general economic conditions 
manufacturing risk mattel owns and operates manufacturing facilities and utilizes third party manufacturers throughout asia  primarily in china  indonesia  malaysia and thailand 
a risk of political instability and civil unrest exists in these countries  which could temporarily or permanently damage mattel s manufacturing operations located there 
mattel s business  financial position and results of operations would be negatively impacted by a significant disruption to its manufacturing operations or suppliers 
financial realignment plan mattel announced a significant financial realignment plan in  which was designed to improve gross margins  selling and administrative expenses  operating profit  and cash flow
