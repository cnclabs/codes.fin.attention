overview digital impact was incorporated in california in october and reincorporated in delaware in october digital impact is the premier provider of online direct marketing solutions for enterprises 
our solutions enable corporations to create and deliver online direct marketing programs that drive revenue  influence behavior and deepen customer relationships 
our solutions provide customer insight and powerful program execution through a combination of hosted applications  technology infrastructure and world class services 
in july  we completed an acquisition of mineshare  inc mineshare  a customer intelligence and analysis company based in santa monica  california  under which mineshare became our wholly owned subsidiary 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price was approximately million 
in connection with the acquisition  we recorded goodwill and intangible assets of approximately million  which we are amortizing over a period of three years 
during the quarter ended march   we performed an impairment assessment of the identified intangibles and goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of mineshare 
as a result of our review  we recorded an impairment charge of million relating to goodwill 
please refer to recent accounting pronouncements below for a description of accounting methodology for goodwill and intangibles beginning april  we derive our revenues from the sale of solutions that enable businesses to proactively communicate with their customers online 
primarily  these services have consisted of the design and execution of online direct marketing campaigns  the development and execution of customer acquisition programs and additional services provided by our professional services organization 
revenue for direct marketing and acquisition campaigns are recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the campaign has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
revenue generated by our professional service group is typically recognized as the service is provided 
as of march  the company had full time employees  fewer than the employed on march  we restructured our organization throughout fiscal in order to streamline operations  reduce costs and bring our staffing structure in line with current economic conditions 
critical accounting policies and estimates digital impact s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and evaluations  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  intangible assets  restructuring costs and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and evaluations on historical experience and various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affects its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  estimating valuation allowances  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts  and valuation of long lived assets and goodwill  revenue recognition 
we generate revenue from the sale of solutions that enable businesses to proactively communicate with their customers online 
digital impact applies the provisions of staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition and recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the service has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
customer marketing revenues are recognized on delivery of the campaigns 
revenues attributable to one time set up fees for service initiation are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the client s service agreement  typically twelve months 
customer acquisition revenues are derived primarily from programs that assist clients in growing their email lists through the use of third party list rentals 
customer acquisition programs fall into two general categories list rental programs and prospectnet programs 
list rental programs involve the execution and delivery of email campaigns to a defined number of individuals provided by a third party list rental service 
prospectnet programs involve the strategic placement of a digital impact client offer on a third party site for the purpose of generating new opt in email addresses for the client 
digital impact contracts with third party providers to deliver secure names of individuals who opt in to join the client s email list 
digital impact is obligated to make payments to third parties for the cost of services associated with the execution of list rental and prospectnet programs 
these costs are recognized in the period that the programs are executed and are netted against program revenue 
digital impact provides other complimentary services to clients  such as  strategy  solutions engineering  web page development  creative design and data analytics 
these services are typically billed on an hourly rate 
the revenue for engagements that support the delivery of future products and services  such as targeted email delivery  is deferred at the time of delivery and recognized pro rata over the future periods of usage 
the period over which the revenue is recognized varies  generally between one and twelve months  depending on the term of the contract or the estimated period of usage 
management uses their best estimates to determine the appropriate period for revenue deferral 
we assess probability of collection based on a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
new customers and certain existing customers are subject to a credit review process that evaluates the customers financial position and ultimately their ability to pay according to the original terms of the arrangement 
based on our review process  if it is determined from the outset or during the term of an arrangement that collection of the resulting receivable is not probable  then revenue is recognized on a cash collected basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  management must make estimates of the uncollectable portion of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debt experience  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of march  valuation of long lived assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identified intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill annually and whenever events or a change 
table of contents in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any potential impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to million as of march  on april   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and as a result we will reclassify million related to assembled workforce to goodwill and cease amortizing the goodwill balance of million 
we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in the first half of fiscal and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge upon the completion of an initial  preliminary impairment review 
quarterly results of operation the following table sets forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly statement of operations data for the eight quarters ended march  this information is unaudited  but in the opinion of management  it has been prepared on substantially the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  and all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the unaudited consolidated quarterly results of operation 
the consolidated quarterly data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to such statements appearing elsewhere in this report

the amount and timing of our operating expenses will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our level of actual and anticipated business activity 
our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast and will fluctuate  and we believe you should not rely on them as an indication of future performance 
results of operations the following table sets forth  as a percentage of revenues  statement of operations data for the periods indicated

the number of clients declined slightly from march  to march  this decline in clients was primarily the result of a loss of dot com customers as their businesses failed and they ceased operations 
this decline was partially offset by client additions among mid cap and fortune companies 
the volume of emails delivered during fiscal was essentially equal to the prior year  and we experienced a slight erosion in pricing 

table of contents cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses relating to the delivery of online direct marketing services  including personnel costs of our services staff  the amortization of equipment  purchased and licensed technology  and data center expenses 
total cost of revenues increased to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in cost of revenue was primarily related to an increase in depreciation and maintenance expense of million  as a result of our investments in our data center infrastructure and a  increase in data center rent 
these increases were largely offset by lower costs for personnel salaries and consultants of million  resulting from reductions in staffing in the services and operations staff 
gross margin decreased to for the fiscal year from for the fiscal  largely due to the increased investment in our data center infrastructure which resulted in excess capacity that  when spread over our revenue base produced lower margins 
operating expenses our operating expenses are classified into three general categories research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative 
we classify all charges to these operating expense categories based on the nature of the expenditures 
although each category includes expenses that are unique to each operating category  some expenditures  such as compensation  employee benefits  recruiting costs  equipment costs  travel and entertainment costs  facilities costs and third party professional service fees  occur in each of these categories 
we allocate the total cost for information services and facilities to each functional area that uses the information services and facilities based on each area s relative headcount 
these allocated charges include rent and other facility related costs  communication charges and depreciation expense for furniture and equipment 
total operating expenses also include non cash expenses related to stock based compensation  amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles  goodwill impairment charges  write off of acquired in process research and development and fixed assets and restructuring charges 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs  consultants and outside contractor costs  and software and hardware maintenance costs for our development efforts 
historically  all research and development costs have been expensed as incurred  however in the quarter ended march   we capitalized  of research and development expense related to the development of our impact product 
research and development expense decreased by to million for the year ended march  from million for year ended march  the decrease was mainly attributable to reductions in personnel costs of million resulting from a person reduction in headcount related to restructuring activities and completion of the development of our impact product  a million reduction in outside consulting expense related to efforts to meet development needs with internal personnel and a  reduction in recruiting expense 
we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel and related costs for our direct sales force and marketing staff  and marketing programs which include trade shows  advertisements  promotional activities and media events 
sales and marketing expense decreased by to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the decrease was mainly attributable to a million reduction in personnel costs associated with restructuring activities 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for general corporate purposes  including information services  finance  accounting  human resources  facilities and legal 
general and administrative expenses decreased by to million for the 
table of contents year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the decrease was primarily due to decreased personnel costs of  related to a decline in headcount  a  decrease in bad debt expense  a  reduction in outside consulting expense and a  decline in professional and legal fees 
stock based compensation 
in connection with the granting of stock options and restricted stock to our employees and the assumption of options related to the acquisition of mineshare  we recorded unearned stock based compensation totaling approximately million  net of forfeitures  through march  this amount represents the total difference between the exercise prices of the stock options or the purchase price of the restricted stock and the deemed fair market value of the underlying common stock for accounting purposes on the date granted 
this amount is included as a component of stockholders equity and is being amortized on an accelerated basis by charges to operations over the vesting period of the options or restricted stock  consistent with the methods described in fasb interpretation no 
stock based compensation  a noncash expense  decreased to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the decline was primarily attributable to the cancellation of unearned stock based compensation for terminated employees during fiscal  offset by stock based compensation expense related to the granting of restricted stock during fiscal as of march   approximately million of total unearned deferred stock based compensation remains to be amortized 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles 
we recorded million in amortization in the fiscal year ended march  compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease was due to a million goodwill impairment that was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal the goodwill and purchased intangibles relate to the july  acquisition of mineshare and are being amortized over three years 
in accordance with sfas no 
 effective april  digital impact no longer amortizes our existing goodwill 
in addition  we are required to review goodwill for impairment effective april  as part of the transition provisions 
any impairment resulting from the transition provisions will be recorded as of april  and will be recognized as the effect of a change in accounting principle 
we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge upon the completion of an initial  preliminary impairment review 
goodwill impairment 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed an impairment assessment of the identified intangibles and goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of mineshare 
the assessment was performed primarily as a result of the significant sustained decline in our stock price since the valuation date of the shares issued in the mineshare acquisition  the overall decline in industry growth rates  and a decline in fourth quarter of fiscal operating results  the result of our first fall in revenues since inception 
as a result of our review  we recorded a million impairment charge to reduce goodwill 
the charge was determined based upon our estimated discounted cash flow over the remaining useful life of the goodwill using a discount rate of 
the assumptions supporting the cash flows including the discount rate were determined using our best estimates as of such date 
write off of acquired in process research and development and fixed assets 
during the year ended march  we recorded a  loss related to the write off of fixed assets 
during the year ended march  we incurred million of acquired in process research and development expense associated with our acquisition of mineshare 
the amount allocated to intangibles was determined based on an appraisal completed by an independent third party using established valuation techniques 
the in process technology percentage of completion was estimated to be 
the value of this in process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into a commercially viable product  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the sale of the product resulting from the completion of the in process technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
the purchased in process technology was expensed upon acquisition  because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 

table of contents restructuring charges 
for the year ended march   we incurred restructuring charges of approximately million primarily related to exit costs associated with certain excess leased facilities  asset impairments and reductions in our workforce 
the restructuring charge included  for assets disposed of or removed from operations 
assets disposed of or removed from operations consisted primarily of leasehold improvements  computer equipment and related software  office equipment and furniture and fixtures 
these assets were utilized by terminated employees or related to facilities no longer in use 
the restructuring charge also included  for severance  benefits and related costs due to reductions in our workforce 
these severance payments related solely to the employees terminated in our january restructuring 
as of march  we had full time employees 
we restructured our organization throughout  with net workforce reductions of approximately employees  or approximately from march   in order to streamline operations  reduce costs and bring our staffing and structure in line with industry standards and current economic conditions 
the restructuring charge also included  in lease termination costs resulting from our decision to exit and reduce certain facilities 
the costs were paid in the fourth quarter of fiscal other income  net 
other income  net in and consisted primarily of interest earned on cash and short term investments offset by interest expense and other expense 
other income  net decreased by to  for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease is largely due to lower average cash and cash equivalent balances resulting from the use of cash to fund current operations and secondarily to lower prevailing interest rates during the period 
income taxes 
no provision for federal and state income taxes was recorded as we incurred net operating losses from inception through march  due to the uncertainty regarding the ultimate utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards  we have not recorded any benefit for losses and a valuation allowance has been recorded for the entire amount of the net deferred tax asset 
the tax reform act of limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company 
if we should have an ownership change  as defined for tax purposes  utilization of the carryforwards could be restricted 
in addition  sales of our stock  including shares sold in the initial public offering  may further restrict our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards 
comparison of the years ended march  and revenues total revenues increased by to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march   primarily as a result of the factors listed below

the company s future cash flows will depend upon the level of the future sales which depend on technology and product development  changes in the marketplace  liquidity  competition from existing and new competitors which may enter the marketplace and retention of key personnel and our ability to control expenses 
the company presently uses its cash and cash equivalent balances to fund its operating  investing and financing activities 
if due to the risks outlined in the previous paragraph  revenues were to decline significantly  this could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to achieve its intended business objectives 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and supersedes accounting principals board apb no 
 business combinations 
the provisions of sfas no 
were adopted july  the most significant changes made by sfas no 
are requiring that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   establishing specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill  and requiring unallocated negative goodwill to be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain 
sfas no 
primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition and supersedes apb no 
 intangible assets 
the most significant changes made by sfas no 
are goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized  goodwill will be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level  intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life will be tested for impairment at least annually  and the amortization period of intangible assets with finite lives will no longer be limited to forty years 
we have adopted sfas no 
effective april   and as a result no longer amortize our goodwill balance of million 
at march   net goodwill was  and goodwill amortization expense was  for the year ended march  we will be required to measure goodwill for impairment effective april  as part of the transition provisions 
any impairment resulting from the transition provisions will be recorded as of april  and will be recognized as the effect of a change in accounting principle 
we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of an initial  preliminary impairment review 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is required to be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
requires  among other things  the application of one accounting model for long lived assets that are impaired or to be disposed of by sale 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements or results of operations 
certain factors which may impact future operating results our future operating results may vary substantially from period to period due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the following discussion highlights some of these factors and the possible impact of these factors on future results of operations 
if any of the following factors actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 
in that case  the price of our common stock could decline  and investors could experience losses on their investment 
because of our limited operating history and the emerging nature of the online direct marketing industry  any predictions about our future revenues and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer business history  and we cannot determine trends that may affect our business 
we were incorporated in october in california and reincorporated in delaware in october our limited operating history makes financial forecasting and evaluation of our business difficult 
since we have limited financial data  any predictions about our future revenues and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer business history 
because of the emerging nature of the online direct marketing industry  we cannot determine trends that may emerge in our market or affect our business 
the revenue and income potential of the online direct marketing industry  and our business  are unproven 
our operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly from period to period  and our stock price may decline if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors 
our operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly from period to period 
as a result  our operating results are difficult to predict and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock would likely decline 

table of contents we derive a significant portion of our revenue from advertising services  which revenues tend to be cyclical and dependent on the economic prospects of advertisers and direct marketers and the economy in general 
a continued decrease in expenditures by advertisers and direct marketers or a continued downturn in the economy could cause our revenues to decline significantly in any given period 
we derive  and expect to continue to derive for the foreseeable future  a large portion of our revenue from products and services we provide to advertisers  direct marketers and agencies 
expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical  reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns 
the overall market for advertising  including internet advertising  has been characterized in recent quarters by increasing softness of demand  lower prices for advertisements  the reduction or cancellation of advertising contracts  an increased risk of uncollectible receivables from customer and the reduction of marketing and advertising budgets  especially for online advertising and by internet related companies 
as a result of these reductions  advertising spending across traditional media  as well as the internet  has decreased 
we cannot assure you that further reductions in advertising spending will not occur 
we also cannot assure you that if economic conditions improve  marketing budgets and advertising spending will increase from current levels 
a continued decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers spending priorities or increase the time it takes to close a sale with a customer 
as a result  our revenues from advertisements and advertising services may decline significantly in any given period 
seasonal trends may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the traditional direct marketing industry has typically generated lower revenues during the summer months and higher revenues during the calendar year end months 
we believe our business is affected by similar revenue fluctuations  but our limited operating history is insufficient to isolate and predict the magnitude of these effects 
because we do experience these effects  analysts and investors may not be able to predict our quarterly or annual operating results 
if we fail to meet expectations of analysts and investors  our stock price could decline 
if businesses and consumers fail to accept online direct marketing as a means to attract new customers  demand for our services may not develop and the price of our stock could decline 
the market for online direct marketing services is relatively new and rapidly evolving  and our business may be harmed if sufficient demand for our services does not develop 
our current and planned services are very different from the traditional methods that many of our clients have historically used to attract new customers and maintain customer relationships 
the loss of a major client could result in lower than expected revenues 
the loss of a major client could harm our business 
while only one client accounted for more than of our revenues for the fiscal year ended march   the loss of this client or another major client could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
additionally  many internet based businesses have recently been experiencing financial problems 
while the majority of our clients are not internet based businesses  the loss of a number of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations 
the online direct marketing industry is highly competitive  and if we are unable to compete effectively  the demand for  or the prices of  our services may decline 
the market for online direct marketing is highly competitive  rapidly evolving and experiencing rapid technological change 
intense competition may result in price reductions  reduced sales  gross margins and operating margins  and loss of market share 
our principal competitors include providers of online direct marketing solutions such as doubleclick  responsys  cheetahmail  cmgi s yesmail through its recent acquisition of post communications  edialog and clickaction  as well as the in house information technology departments of our existing and prospective clients 

table of contents in addition  we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future  which could harm our ability to increase sales and maintain our prices 
in the future  we may experience competition from internet service providers  advertising and direct marketing agencies and other large established businesses possessing large  existing customer bases  substantial financial resources and established distribution channels and could develop  market or resell a number of online direct marketing solutions 
these potential competitors may also choose to enter  or have already entered  the market for online direct marketing by acquiring one of our existing competitors or by forming strategic alliances with a competitor 
many of these potential competitors have broad distribution channels and they may bundle competing products or services 
as a result of future competition  the demand for our services could substantially decline 
any of these occurrences could harm our ability to compete effectively 
if we do not attract and retain additional highly skilled personnel  we may be unable to execute our business strategy 
our business depends on the continued technological innovation of our core services and our ability to provide comprehensive online direct marketing expertise 
our main offices are located in the san francisco bay area  where competition for personnel with internet related technology and marketing skills has traditionally been intense 
if we fail to identify  attract  retain and motivate these highly skilled personnel  we may be unable to successfully introduce new services or otherwise implement our business strategy 
as a public company we face greater difficulty attracting and retaining personnel than we did as a private company 
we rely on the services of our founders and other key personnel  whose knowledge of our business and technical expertise would be extremely difficult to replace 
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of our senior management 
in particular  we depend upon the continued services of our co founders william park  our chief executive officer  and gerardo capiel  our chief technology officer  whose vision for our company  knowledge of our business and technical expertise would be extremely difficult to replace 
in addition  we have not obtained life insurance benefiting digital impact covering any of our key employees 
if any of our key employees left or was seriously injured and unable to work and we were unable to find a qualified replacement  the level of services we are able to provide could decline or we could be otherwise unable to execute our business strategy 
if the delivery of our email messages is limited or blocked  then our clients may discontinue their use of our services 
our business model relies on our ability to deliver emails over the internet through internet service providers and to recipients in major corporations 
in particular  a significant percentage of our emails are sent to recipients who use america online 
we do not have  and we are not required to have  an agreement with america online to deliver emails to their customers 
america online uses a proprietary set of technologies to handle and deliver email and the value of our services will be reduced if we are unable to provide emails compatible with these technologies 
in addition  america online and other internet service providers are able to block unwanted messages to their users 
if these companies limit or halt the delivery of our emails  or if we fail to deliver emails in such a way as to be compatible with these companies email handling technologies  then our clients may discontinue their use of our services 
our facilities and systems are vulnerable to natural disasters and other unexpected events  and any of these events could result in an interruption of our ability to execute our clients online direct marketing campaigns 
we depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operations of our data center and hardware systems 
our data center and hardware systems are located in northern california  an area susceptible to earthquakes 
our data center and hardware systems are also vulnerable to damage from fire  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  and similar events 
if any of these events results in damage to our data center or systems  we 
table of contents may be unable to execute our clients online direct marketing campaigns until the damage is repaired  and may accordingly lose clients and revenues 
in addition  we may incur substantial costs in repairing any damage 
our data center is located at facilities provided by a third party  and if this party is unable to adequately protect our data center  our reputation may be harmed and we may lose clients 
our data center  which is critical to our ongoing operations  is located at facilities provided by a third party 
our operations depend on this party s ability to protect our data center from damage or interruption from human error  break ins  sabotage  computer viruses  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
if this party is unable to adequately protect our data center and information is lost or our ability to deliver our services is interrupted  our reputation may be harmed and we may lose clients 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  third parties could use our intellectual property without our consent 
our ability to successfully compete is substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and intellectual property  which we protect through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law  and contractual obligations 
we have no issued patents and have two us patent applications pending 
we have several registered us trademarks and have several more applications pending in the us  europe and japan 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights 
unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain and use our proprietary information 
policing unauthorized use of our proprietary information is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
if we are unable to safeguard the confidential information in our data warehouse  our reputation may be harmed and we may be exposed to liability 
we currently store confidential customer information in a secure data warehouse 
we cannot be certain  however  that we will be able to prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access to this data warehouse 
if any compromise or breach of security were to occur  it could harm our reputation and expose us to possible liability 
any unauthorized access to our servers could result in the misappropriation of confidential customer information or cause interruptions in our services 
it is also possible that one of our employees could attempt to misuse confidential customer information  exposing us to liability 
in addition  our reputation may be harmed if we lose customer information maintained in our data warehouse due to systems interruptions or other reasons 
activities of our clients could damage our reputation or give rise to legal claims against us 
our clients promotion of their products and services may not comply with federal  state and local laws  including but not limited to laws and regulations surrounding the internet 
we cannot predict whether our role in facilitating these marketing activities would expose us to liability under these laws 
any claims made against us could be costly and time consuming to defend 
if we are exposed to this kind of liability  we could be required to pay substantial fines or penalties  redesign our business methods  discontinue some of our services or otherwise expend resources to avoid liability 
our services involve the transmission of information through the internet 
our services could be used to transmit harmful applications  negative messages  unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted material  inaccurate data or computer viruses to end users in the course of delivery 
any transmission of this kind could damage our reputation or could give rise to legal claims against us 
we could spend a significant amount of time and money defending against these legal claims 
new regulation of  and uncertainties regarding the application of existing laws and regulations to  online direct marketing and the internet could prohibit  limit or increase the cost of our business 
legislation has been enacted in several states regulating the sending of unsolicited commercial email 
we cannot assure you that existing or future legislation regarding commercial email will not harm our business 

table of contents the federal government  foreign governments and several other states are considering  or have considered  similar legislation 
these provisions generally limit or prohibit both the transmission of unsolicited commercial emails and the use of forged or fraudulent routing and header information 
some states  including california  require that unsolicited emails include opt out instructions and that senders of these emails honor any opt out requests 
our business could be negatively impacted by new laws or regulations applicable to online direct marketing or the internet  the application of existing laws and regulations to online direct marketing or the internet or the application of new laws and regulations to our business as we expand into new jurisdictions 
there is a growing body of laws and regulations applicable to access to or commerce on the internet 
moreover  the applicability to the internet of existing laws is uncertain and may take years to resolve 
due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  it is likely that additional laws and regulations will be adopted covering issues such as privacy  pricing  content  copyrights  distribution  taxation  antitrust  characteristics and quality of services and consumer protection 
the adoption of any additional laws or regulations may impair the growth of the internet or online direct marketing  which could  in turn  decrease the demand for our services and prohibit  limit or increase the cost of our doing business 
internet related stock prices are especially volatile and this volatility may depress our stock price 
the stock market and specifically the stock prices of internet related companies have been very volatile 
because we are an internet related company  we expect our stock price to be similarly volatile 
as a result of this volatility  the market price of our common stock could significantly decrease 
this volatility is often not related to our operating performance and may accordingly reduce the price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for the period from our inception through march   we provided our services to clients primarily in the united states 
as a result  our financial results have not been materially affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
the majority of our sales are currently denominated in us dollars 
during the fiscal year ending march   we established a subsidiary in the united kingdom which has had minimal operations to date 
as the operations of this subsidiary expand  our future operating results could be directly impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in this region 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio and on the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay on our outstanding debt instruments 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest expense is limited  however  to the exposure related to those debt instruments and credit facilities which are tied to market rates 
we do not plan to use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we plan to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we plan to mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities
