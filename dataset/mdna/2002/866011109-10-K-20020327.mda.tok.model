corrective measures for capital deficiencies 
fdicia requires the federal banking regulators to take prompt corrective action with respect to capital deficient insured depository institutions with the overall goal of limiting losses to the depository insurance fund 
fdicia contains broad restrictions on certain activities of undercapitalized institutions involving asset growth  acquisitions  branch establishment and expansion into new lines of business 
with certain exceptions  national banks will be prohibited from making capital distributions  including dividends  or paying management fees to a holding company if the payment of such distributions or fees will cause them to become undercapitalized 
furthermore  undercapitalized national banks will be required to file capital restoration plans with the occ 
such a plan will not be accepted unless  among other things  the banking institution s holding company guarantees the plan up to a certain specified amount 
any such guarantee from a depository institution s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy 
undercapitalized national banks also will be subject to restrictions on growth  acquisitions  branching  and engaging in new lines of business unless they have an approved capital plan that permits otherwise 
a bank which is not well capitalized may not accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval and will be subject to limitations on interest rates which it offers on deposits 
the occ also may  among other things  require an undercapitalized national bank to issue shares or obligations  which could be voting stock  to recapitalize the institution or  under certain circumstances  to divest itself of any subsidiary 
the occ and other federal banking agencies are authorized by fdicia to take various enforcement actions against any significantly undercapitalized national bank and any national bank that fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement a plan accepted by the occ 
these powers include  among other things  requiring the institution to be recapitalized  prohibiting asset growth or requiring asset reduction  restricting interest rates paid  requiring frb prior approval of any capital distributions by any bank holding company which controls the institution  requiring divestiture by the institution of its subsidiaries or by the holding company of the institution itself  requiring new election of directors  and requiring the dismissal of directors and officers 
significantly and critically undercapitalized national banks may be subject to more extensive control and supervision 
a critically undercapitalized institution may be prohibited from  among other things  entering into any material transaction not in the ordinary course of business  amending its charter or bylaws  or engaging in certain transactions with affiliates 
in addition  critically undercapitalized institutions generally will be prohibited from making payments of principal or interest on outstanding subordinated debt 
within days of a national bank s becoming critically undercapitalized  the occ must appoint a receiver or conservator unless certain findings are made with respect to the prospect for the institution s continued viability 
deposit insurance assessments 
the fdic is required by the federal deposit insurance act to assess all banks a fee in order to fund adequately the bank insurance fund the bif so as to resolve any insured bank that is declared insolvent by its primary regulator 
fdicia required the fdic to establish a risk based deposit insurance premium schedule 
the risk based assessment system is used to calculate deposit insurance assessments made on bif member banks to maintain the designated reserves for the fund 
in addition  the fdic can impose special assessments to repay borrowings from the us treasury  the federal financing bank  and bif member banks 
under the risk based system  banks are assessed insurance premiums according to how much risk they are deemed to present to the bif 
such premiums currently range from zero percent of insured deposits to of insured deposits 
banks with higher levels of capital and involving a low degree of supervisory concern are assessed lower premiums than those banks with lower levels of capital and a higher degree of supervisory concern 
the bank is currently being assessed at the lowest rate of zero percent 
under the deposit insurance funds act of the funds act  beginning in banks insured under the bif were required to pay a part of the interest on bonds issued by the financing corporation fico in the late s to recapitalize the defunct federal savings and loan insurance corporation 
before the funds act  fico payments were made only by depository institutions which were members of the savings association insurance fund the saif 
under the funds act  until january   bif members were assessed for fico payments at only one fifth the rate of assessment on saif members 
the funds act required that  as of january   all bif and saif insured institutions pay fico assessments at the same rate 
for the first quarter of  fico rates have been set at 
for both bif and saif members 
the fico assessment rates for both bif and saif members for were fourth quarter 
third quarter 
second quarter 
first quarter 
internal operating requirements 
fdicia requires fdic insured depository institutions with over million in assets to file an annual report with the fdic and its primary federal regulator and any appropriate state banking agency within days after the end of its fiscal year 
the report must contain financial statements audited by an independent public accountant  a statement of management s responsibilities for preparing the financial statements and for maintaining internal controls  financial reporting and complying with designated safety and soundness laws and regulations  and assessing the effectiveness of the institution s internal controls and compliance with safety and soundness laws and regulations 
the independent public accountant also must report separately on the institution s internal controls and certain of the statements made by management in the report 
the requirement of an annual audit of the bank can be satisfied by an annual audit of the corporation 
the annual report must be available for public inspection 
each institution to which the annual report requirement applies must also have an independent audit committee entirely made up of outside directors 
the audit committee s duties must include reviewing with management and the independent public accounts the basis for the annual report 
the requirement of an audit committee for the bank can be satisfied by the services of an audit committee of the corporation 
community reinvestment act 
the community reinvestment act of cra and the regulations issued by the occ to implement that law are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service area  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks 
these regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a bank s record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering applications to establish branches  merger applications and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank 
firrea requires federal banking agencies to make public a rating of a bank s performance under the cra 
in the case of a bank holding company  the cra performance record of its subsidiary bank is reviewed in connection with the filing of an application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or to merge with any other bank holding company 
an unsatisfactory record can substantially delay or block the transaction 
a less than satisfactory cfa rating can limit the extent to which a bank and its affiliates can take advantage of the expanded range of activities permitted by the glb act 
customer privacy 
the glb act enacted new measures to protect the security  confidentiality  and integrity of information concerning customers of financial institutions 
the federal banking agencies were directed by the glb act to adopt rules of carry out those measures  and were given broad authority to enforce the privacy provisions of the act and rules adopted to carry out those provisions 
the agencies have adopted guidelines for safeguarding customer information which became effective july  the agencies guidelines require each financial institution to establish an information security program which will identify and assess risks that may threaten the confidentiality of customer information 
the institution must develop a written plan containing policies and procedures to manage and control those risks and implement and test the plan 
the plan must be adjusted on a continuing basis for changes in technology  the sensitivity of customer information  and internal and external threats to information security 
a financial institution s policy for protecting the confidentiality and security of nonpublic personal information must be disclosed to the customer at the time the customer relationship is established and at least annually thereafter 
expanding enforcement authority one of the major effects of fdicia was the increased ability of banking regulators to monitor the activities of banks and their holding companies 
the federal banking agencies have extensive authority to police unsafe or unsound practices and violations of applicable laws and regulations by depository institutions and their holding companies 
for example  the fdic may terminate the deposit insurance of any institution which it determines has engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice 
the agencies can also assess civil money penalties  issue cease and desist or removal orders  seek judicial enforcement of their orders  and publicly disclose such actions 
changing regulatory structure legislative and regulatory proposals regarding changes in banking  regulations of banks  thrifts and other financial institutions  are being considered by the executive branch of the federal government  congress  and various state governments  including texas 
certain of these proposals  if adopted  could significantly change the regulation of banks and the financial service industry 
the corporation cannot predict accurately whether any of these proposals will be adopted or  if adopted  how these proposals will affect the corporation or the bank 
also  there likely will be regulatory changes to deal with the expanded permissible activities permitted for financial holding companies and financial subsidiaries of national banks 
the corporation cannot predict at this time the effect of regulatory changes resulting from the enactment of the glb act 
the usa patriot act of  which was signed into law on october   imposed upon financial institutions new requirements for obtaining information  reporting  and record keeping designed to prevent money laundering 
effect on economic environment the policies of regulatory authorities  including the monetary policy of the frb  have a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries 
among the means available to the frb to affect the money supply are open market operations in us government securities  control of borrowings at the discount window  changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowing  changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits and against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates and the placing of limits on interest rates that member banks may pay on time and savings deposits 
these means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans  investments  and deposits  and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits 
frb monetary policies have materially affected the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the corporation cannot predict the nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the business and earnings of the corporation and the bank

the corporation has paid regular cash dividends on its common stock on a quarterly basis since the beginning of the following table sets forth  for each quarter since the beginning of  the quarterly dividends paid by the corporation on its common stock for the indicated periods 
dividends per share first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter although the board of directors intends to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future  there can be no assurance that cash dividends will continue to the paid in the future or  if paid  that such cash dividends will be comparable to cash dividends previously paid by the corporation  since future dividend policy is subject to the discretion of the board of directors of the corporation and will depend upon a number of factors  including future earnings of the corporation  the financial condition of the corporation  the corporation s cash needs  general business conditions and the amount of dividends paid to the corporation by the bank 
the principal source of the corporation s cash revenues is dividends received from the bank 
pursuant to the national bank act  no national bank may pay dividends from its paid in capital 
all dividends must be paid out of current or retained net profits  after deducting reserves for losses and bad debts 
the national bank act further restricts the payment of dividends out of net profits by prohibiting a national bank from declaring a dividend on its shares of common stock until the surplus fund equals the amount of capital stock or  if the surplus fund does not equal the amount of capital stock  until one tenth of a bank s net profits for the preceding half year in the case of quarterly or semi annual dividends  or the preceding two half year periods in the case of annual dividends  are transferred to the surplus fund 
the approval of the occ is required prior to the payment of a dividend if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for that year combined with its net profits for the two preceding years 
under fdicia  the bank may not pay a dividend if  after paying the dividend  the bank would be undercapitalized 
in addition  the appropriate regulatory authorities are authorized to prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends which would constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
the bank and the corporation are not currently subject to any regulatory restrictions on their dividends

the decline in earnings during reflects merger expenses of  recorded in the first quarter 
excluding these expenses after tax earnings would have been million  or per diluted shares 
also impacting earnings was an increase in provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter due to increased loan charge offs 
see discussion on page  allowance for loan losses 
continuing to reflect the positive growth of the corporation  loans increased over the previous year end to million at december  total fundings deposits and short term borrowings experienced growth also  increasing over the same period to million 
shareholders equity was million at year end  an increase of 
net income for was million compared to net income of million for  a decrease of 
the decrease in earnings for was attributable to a significant increase in provision for loan losses and a writedown of foreclosed assets 
the increase in provision for loan losses was related to the charge off of million on one loan and 
million on another during the following table shows selected key performance ratios over the last three years return on average assets roa return on average shareholders equity roe shareholders equity to assets average dividend payout ratio excluding merger related expenses roa and roe would have been and  respectively 
the ratio  return on assets  is calculated by dividing net income by average total assets for the year 
the return on equity ratio is calculated by dividing net income by average shareholders equity for the year 
the equity to assets ratio is calculated by dividing average shareholders equity by average total assets for the year 
the dividend payout is determined by dividing the total dividends paid by the total net income 
net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid for the funds supporting those assets 
the largest category of earning assets consists of loans to businesses and individuals 
the second largest is investment securities 
net interest income is the principal source of the corporation s earnings 
interest rate fluctuations  as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and liabilities supporting those assets  affect net interest income 
interest rates primarily are determined by national and international market trends  as well as competitive pressures in the corporation s operating markets 
for analytical purposes  income from tax exempt assets  primarily securities issued by or loans made to state and local governments  is adjusted by an increment which equates tax exempt income to interest from taxable assets 
net interest income tax equivalent for was million  an increase of 
million  or 
compared to the prior year 
the net increase reflected a million decrease in interest income which was offset by a million decrease in interest expense 
the corporation s yield on earning assets decreased to for from for rates paid on the corporation s interest bearing liabilities decreased to for from for these shifts in yield on earning assets and cost of interest bearing liabilities resulted in the net interest margin decreasing from for to for the slight increase in net interest income was due to the growth in average loans and the growth in average demand deposits during  offsetting the basis point decline in net interest margin 
although the average demand deposits as a percent of average total deposits decreased to in from in  this ratio remains very positive compared to the corporation s peers 
summary of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities although the year end detail provides satisfactory indicators of general trends  the daily average balance sheets are more meaningful for analysis purposes than year end data because averages reflect the day to day fluctuations that are common to bank balance sheets 
also  average balances for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can be related directly to the components of interest income and interest expense on the statements of income 
this provides the basis for analysis of rates earned and paid  and sources of increases and decreases in net interest income as derived from changes in volumes and rates 
the following schedule presents average balance sheets for the most recent three years in a format that highlights earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

presented on a tax equivalent basis t e using a federal income tax rate of in all three years 
net interest margin  the net return on interest earning assets which is computed by dividing net interest income by average total earning assets  was for  a basis point decrease from the previous year 
this decrease in the margin reflected a lower yield on earning assets in of basis points compared to the prior year somewhat offset by a lower cost of funds of basis points compared to the prior year 
part of the reason for this was the change in mix of liabilities with the average balance of certificates of deposit accounting for of total funding in compared to in  resulting in the net interest spread decreasing from to 
these certificates can not be repriced as quickly as variable rate assets 
the table below presents the portions of the net change in net interest income due to changes in volume or rate for each of the years ended december  and on a fully tax equivalent basis 
non accruing loans have been included in assets for these computations  thereby reducing yields on total loans

in this same period total interest income decreased and total interest expense decreased 
non interest income 
non interest income is an important contributor to net earnings 
the major component of the corporation s non interest income is various charges and fees earned on deposit accounts and related services 
the following table summarizes the changes in non interest income during the past three years dollars in thousands amount change amount change amount service charges on deposit accounts    non recurring income gain loss on sale of investment securities other non interest income    total non interest income    service charges on deposits increased in primarily as a result of increased analysis income on commercial accounts due to the reduction in the earnings credit rate earned by customers on balances maintained to cover the cost of services provided by the corporation 
also  insufficient funds charges on deposit accounts increased in the non recurring income in was primarily interest recovered on loans either charged off in prior years or loans that were on non accrual status in prior years 
non recurring income in included refunds of state franchise tax of  gain on sale of land of  a forfeited deposit of  related to a proposed sale of foreclosed property  and interest recovered on loans either charged off in prior years or loans that were on non accrual status in prior years of  the increase in other non interest income in is primarily due to an increase in investment services income  letter of credit fees and collection fees 
the increase in other non interest income in is primarily due to an increase in debit card fees and mortgage brokerage origination fees 
non interest expense 
non interest expense includes all expenses of the corporation other than interest expense  provision for loan losses and income tax expense 
the following table summarizes the changes in the non interest expenses for the past three years dollars in thousands amount change amount change amount salaries and employee benefits    occupancy expense net   furniture and equipment expense    other real estate owned expense merger related expense other expenses business development insurance other legal and professional fees other taxes postage and courier printing and supplies regulatory fees and assessments other operating expenses    total other expenses    total non interest expense    total non interest expense increased in over reflecting increases in salaries and benefits  occupancy expenses  business development expenses and merger related expenses incurred to merge the corporation s subsidiaries 
as a percent of average assets  non interest expenses were   and  in  and  respectively 
the efficiency ratio non interest expenses divided by total non interest income plus net interest income was for or when merger related expenses are excluded from non interest expenses 
the efficiency ratio measures what percentage of total revenues are absorbed by non interest expense 
these measures of operating efficiency compare very favorably to other financial institutions in the corporation s peer groups 
the increase in salaries and employee benefits for is due to routine salary merit increases  additions to staff  and an increase in the cost of employee insurance 
the average number of full time equivalent employees increased by in to an average full time equivalent of at year end  the full time equivalent staff was versus at the same time the prior year 
in late  the corporation hired a chief credit officer  two senior credit officers and certain related support staff 
these new employees are expected to make a contribution to growth and earnings in early as they are experienced in the corporation s market 
the increase in occupancy expense is primarily a result of a reduction in rental income as lease space at one of the banking facilities was vacant for a portion of the year and a lower rental rate was received from a major new tenant compared to the rate earned from the vacating tenant 
the increase in expenses for business development were primarily associated with advertising cost related to a name brand identity advertising campaign launched after the merger of the corporation s subsidiaries in may legal and professional fees increased in and reflected increases in attorney fees related to certain problem loans and fees paid to consultants and attorneys for assistance in general corporate issues 
regulatory fees and assessments increased in primarily due to increases in the fdic assessment for deposit insurance

allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
loans  or portions thereof  which are considered to be uncollectible are charged against this allowance and subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance represents the amount which  in management s judgment  will be adequate to absorb future charge offs of existing loans which may become uncollectible 
the adequacy of the allowance is determined by management s periodic evaluation of the loan portfolio and by the employment of third party loan review specialists 
all known problem loans  unknown inherent risks generally associated with bank lending  past loan loss experience  delinquency ratios and current and projected economic conditions are taken into account in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance

loans are generally placed on non accrual status when principal or interest is past due days or more and the loan is not both well secured and in the process of collection  or immediately  if in the opinion of management  full collection of principal or interest is doubtful 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely

in the fourth quarter of  a charge off of  was made on one loan and  was made on another 
these charge offs  although above those of recent years  are not thought to reflect a change in the corporation s lending strategy or a dramatic change in the local economic environment 
the following table reflects the allowance for loan losses compared to total loans at the end of each year dollars in thousands december  total loans      allowance for loan losses      allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans allowance for loan losses as a percent of non performing loans the following table illustrates the allocation of the allowance for loan losses to the various loan categories dollars in thousands  see the table on page for the percent of specific types of loans to total loans december  of of of of of amount total amount total amount total amount total amount total allowance for loan losses commercial      real estate mortgage    real estate construction loans to individuals unallocated portion   total      the allocation is determined by providing specific reserves against each criticized loan plus a general allocation against the remaining balance of the portfolio based on experience factors 
the general allocation is based upon the corporation s loss experience over a period of years and is adjusted for subjective factors such as economic trends  performance trends  and concentrations of credit 
in  the general allocation rate of the allowance was increased by approximately because of changes in these factors 
management of the corporation believes that the allowance for loan losses at december   is adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio 
there can be no assurance that the corporation will not sustain loan losses in future periods which could be substantial in relation to the size of the current allowance 
the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of loans 
non performing assets 
non performing assets consist of non accrual loans  renegotiated loans and other real estate and other foreclosed assets 
non accrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been suspended and on which the interest is recorded as earned when it is received 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when principal or interest is past due days or more and the loan is not both well secured and in the process of collection  or immediately  if in the opinion of management  full collection of principal or interest is doubtful 
at the time a loan is placed on non accrual status  interest previously recorded but not collected is reversed and charged against current interest income 
renegotiated loans are loans on which the interest and or the principal has been reduced due to a deterioration in the borrower s financial condition 
even though these loans are actually performing  they are included in non performing assets because of the loss of revenue related to the reduction of interest and or principal 
other real estate is real estate acquired through foreclosure or through partial settlement of debts and which is awaiting sale and disposition 
at the time of acquisition  other real estate is recorded at the lower of estimated fair value or the loan balance or settlement agreement with any write down charged to the allowance for loan losses 
any further write downs  expenses related to the property  and any gain or loss resulting from the sale of the property are recorded in current operating expenses 
the corporation is required  by the regulatory authorities  to have other real estate evaluated periodically 
in the event the new evaluation value is less than the carrying value of the property  the excess is written off to expense 
some properties are written down below their evaluation values when management feels the economic value of the property has declined below the evaluation value 
the following table summarizes the non performing assets and loans days past due and still accruing as of december for the past five years  dollars in thousands december  non accrual loans      renegotiated loans other real estate other foreclosed assets   total non performing assets      as a percent of total assets total loans and other real estate other foreclosed assets loans past due days or more and still accruing non accrual loans at december   were comprised of  in commercial loans   in real estate mortgages   in real estate construction loans and  in consumer loans 
subsequent to year end  the corporation collected  on one of the commercial loans on non accrual at year end 
other foreclosed assets includes one asset which is the projected wholesale value of text books taken in lieu of foreclosure of a borrower that closed operations 
the impact on interest income from the above non accrual loans and renegotiated loans for the past five years is provided below in thousands years ended december  gross amount of interest that would have been recorded at original rate interest included in income interest not recorded in income loans are graded on a system similar to that used by the banking industry regulators 
the first level of criticized loans is other assets especially mentioned oaem 
these loans are fundamentally sound but have potential weaknesses which may  if not corrected  weaken the asset or inadequately protect the bank s credit position at some future date 
the second level is substandard  which are loans inadequately protected by current sound net worth  paying capacity or pledged collateral of the borrower 
the last level of criticized loans  before they are charged off  is doubtful 
doubtful loans are considered to have inherent weaknesses because collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable 
in addition to the above noted grading system  the corporation maintains a separate watch list which further aids the corporation in monitoring loan quality 
watch list loans show warning elements where the present status portrays one or more deficiencies that require attention in the short run or where pertinent ratios of the loan account have weakened to a point where more frequent monitoring is warranted 
non accrual loans normally include weaker substandard loans and loans that are considered to be doubtful 
the following table summarizes the relationship between non performing loans  criticized loans and the allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands december  non performing loans      criticized loans      allowance for loan losses      allowance for loan losses as a percent of non performing loans criticized loans an independent third party loan review was completed in mid in addition  a regulatory examination was completed as of late based on the findings of these reviews and exams management considers the loan portfolio to be adequately reserved 
criticized loans  loans classified as oaem  substandard or doubtful as noted above  have increased in a significant portion of this increase is due to enhanced classification procedures and the employment of a chief credit officer in the third quarter of the year to assist in monitoring loan quality 
the corporation remains diligent in its efforts to identify any loan that might reflect weakness of the borrower as soon as possible 
management is not aware of any potential loan problems  that have not been disclosed  to which serious doubts exist as to the ability of the borrower to substantially comply with the present repayment terms 
deposits 
the primary source of the corporation s funds is deposits 
the majority of the corporation s deposits are considered core deposits  that is  deposits that are not subject to material changes due to customer withdrawal because of market rate changes 
the corporation does not accept brokered deposits 
average demand deposits increased million  or in these deposits represented of total deposits 
average interest bearing deposits increased million  or 
the deposit types daily average balance and related average rates paid during each of the last three years are as follows dollars in thousands amount rate paid amount rate paid amount rate paid noninterest bearing demand deposits    interest bearing deposits interest bearing transaction accounts    savings    certificates of deposit under  and ira s    certificates of deposit of  or more    other time deposits total interest bearing deposits    total deposits    the remaining maturity on certificates of deposit of  or more as of december   and is presented below in thousands of of of maturity total total total months or less    to months    to months    over months    borrowings 
securities sold under repurchase agreements generally represent borrowings with maturities ranging from one to thirty days 
these borrowings are with significant commercial customers of the corporation that require short term liquidity for their funds 
in addition  the corporation borrows federal funds periodically for liquidity purposes 
information relating to these borrowings is summarized as follows december  securities sold under repurchase agreements average balance    year end balance    maximum month end balance during year    interest rate average year end federal funds purchased average balance year end balance  maximum month end balance during year   interest rate average year end the corporation has available a line of credit with the federal home loan bank of dallas  which allows the borrowing on a collateralized basis at a fixed term 
at december   the corporation had million of borrowings outstanding at a rate of which were scheduled to mature in january for the year ended december  the corporation had average borrowings of  at december   the corporation had no such borrowings 
interest rate sensitivity 
the objectives of monitoring and managing the interest rate risk of the balance sheet are to contribute to earnings by minimizing adverse changes in net interest income as a result of changes in the direction and level of interest rates and to provide liquidity to satisfy cash flow requirements to meet customers fluctuating demands 
interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in the market interest rates and changes in net interest income due to the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
an asset sensitive position in a given period will result in more assets than liabilities being subject to repricing  therefore  market interest rate changes will be reflected more quickly in asset rates 
if interest rates decline  such a position will have an adverse effect on net interest income 
conversely  in a liability sensitive position  where liabilities reprice more quickly than assets in a given period  a decline in market rates will benefit net interest income 
a mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in which relatively equal volumes reprice each period represents a matched interest sensitivity gap position  any excess of these assets or liabilities results in an interest sensitive gap 
the following table  commonly referred to as a static gap report  indicates the interest rate sensitivity position at december  and may not be reflective of positions in subsequent periods dollars in thousands repriced due in after due in due in total year or days days rate non rate or less days to one year sensitive sensitive total interest earning assets loans       investment securities       federal funds sold due from time    total earning assets       interest bearing liabilities interest bearing transaction accounts and savings    certificates of deposits less than  ira s       certificates of deposits greater than other time deposits short term borrowings    total interest bearing liabilities       period interest sensitivity gap       cumulative gap    period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets in the preceding table under the after year category   in investment securities will reprice or mature within one to three years and another  will reprice or mature within three to five years 
the average maturity of the investment portfolio is approximately years 
also  the above table reflects the call dates versus maturity dates and periodic principal amortization of investment securities 
the preceding static gap report reflects a cumulative liability sensitive position during the one year horizon 
an inherent weakness of this report is that it ignores the relative volatility any one category may have in relation to other categories or market rates in general 
for instance  the rate paid on certain interest bearing transaction accounts typically moves slower than the three month t bill 
management attempts to capture this relative volatility by utilizing a simulation model with a beta factor adjustment which estimates the volatility of rate sensitive assets and or liabilities in relation to other market rates 
beta factors are an estimation of the long term  multiple interest rate environment relation between an individual account and market rates in general 
for instance  now  savings and money market accounts  which are repriceable within days will have considerably lower beta factors than variable rate loans and most investment categories 
taking this into consideration  it is quite possible for a bank with a negative cumulative gap to total asset ratio to have a positive beta adjusted gap risk position 
as a result of applying the beta factors established by the corporation s management to the earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in the static gap report via a simulation model  the cumulative gap to total assets ratio at one year of was reversed to a positive beta adjusted gap position 
management feels that the beta adjusted gap risk technique more accurately reflects the corporation s gap position 
in addition to gap analysis  the corporation uses an interest rate risk simulation model and shock analysis to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and the balance sheet  respectively 
contractual maturities and repricing opportunities of loans are incorporated in the model as are prepayment assumptions  maturity data and call options within the investment portfolio 
assumptions based on past experience are incorporated into the model for nonmaturity deposit accounts 
based on the december  simulation analysis  it is estimated that a basis point rise in rates over the next month period would have an impact of approximately on net interest income for the period  while a basis point decline in rates over the same period would have an impact of approximately on net interest income for the period 
the results are primarily from the behavior of demand  money market and savings deposits 
the corporation has found that  historically  interest rates on these deposits change more slowly in a rising rate environment than in a declining rate environment 
this assumption is incorporated into the simulation model and is generally not fully reflected in a gap analysis 
the analysis does not contemplate any actions that the corporation might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  this analysis is not intended to be and does not provide a forecast of the effect actual changes in market rates will have on the corporation 
the following table reflects the spreads and margins for the past three years yield on earning assets t e cost of funds net interest spread t e net interest margin t e capital resources 
at december  shareholders equity totaled million  an increase of million or for the year 
this increase reflects retained earnings  ie  earnings net of dividends to shareholders  and the impact of the repurchase of shares of common stock of the corporation

bank regulatory authorities have established risk based capital guidelines for us banking organizations 
the objective of these efforts is to provide a more consistent system for comparing capital positions of banking organizations and to reflect the level of risk associated with holding various categories of assets 
the guidelines define tier capital and tier capital 
the only components of tier and tier capital  for the corporation  are equity capital and a portion of the allowance for loan losses  respectively 
these two components combine to become total capital 
the guidelines also stipulate that four categories of risk weights    and percent  primarily based on the relative credit risk of the counterparty  be applied to the different types of balance sheet assets 
risk weights for all off balance sheet exposures are determined by a two step process  whereas the face value of the off balance sheet item is converted to a credit equivalent amount and that amount is assigned to the appropriate risk category 
off balance sheet items at december  and included unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit 
the minimum ratio for qualifying total capital is  of which must be tier capital 
the federal reserve board and the comptroller of the currency also have a capital to total assets leverage guideline 
these guidelines establish a minimum level of tier capital to total assets of percent 
a banking organization operating at or near these levels is expected to have well diversified risk  excellent asset quality  high liquidity  good earnings and in general be considered a strong banking organization 
organizations not meeting these characteristics are expected to operate well above these minimum capital standards 
thus  for all but the most highly rated organizations  the minimum tier leverage ratio is to be percent plus minimum additional cushions of at least to basis points 
at the discretion of the regulatory authorities  additional capital may be required 
the table below illustrates the corporation s and its subsidiary compliance with the regulatory guidelines as of december  dollars in thousands the consolidated summit corporation bank  na total assets   risk weighted assets   equity capital tier   qualifying allowance for loan losses   total capital   leverage ratio risk capital ratio tier capital total capital the corporation had an unrealized gain on available for sale securities  net of deferred taxes  of  as of december  under regulatory requirements  the unrealized gain or loss on available for sale securities is not included in the calculation of risk based capital 
as can be seen in the preceding table  the corporation and its subsidiary exceed the risk based capital and leverage requirements set by the regulators as of december  also  as of december   the corporation and its subsidiary met the criteria for classification as a well capitalized institution under the rules of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia 
liquidity 
liquidity is defined as the corporation s ability to meet deposit withdrawals  provide for the legitimate credit needs of customers  and take advantage of certain investment opportunities as they arise 
while maintaining adequate liquid assets to fulfill these functions  it must also maintain compatible levels of maturity and rate concentrations between its sources of funds and earning assets 
the liability structure of the corporation is short term in nature and the asset structure is likewise oriented towards short maturities 
the corporation s primary internal source of liquidity is its federal funds sold and its marketable investment securities  particularly those with shorter maturities 
federal funds sold and investment securities maturing within days represented million or of total assets 
additionally  the corporation s ability to sell loan participations and purchase federal funds serves as secondary sources of liquidity 
the subsidiary has approved federal funds lines at other banks 
the liquidity of the corporation is enhanced by the fact that of total deposits at december   were core deposits 
core deposits for this purpose are defined as total deposits less public funds and certificates of deposit greater than  also  the corporation s loan to deposit ratio averaged a somewhat conservative for the year 
the parent company s income  which provides funds for the payment of dividends to shareholders and for other corporate purposes  is derived from the investment in its subsidiary 
see note dividends from the subsidiary for limitations on dividends payable by the subsidiary 
impact of inflation 
the effects of inflation on the local economy and on the corporation s operating results have been relatively modest for the past several years 
since substantially all of the corporation s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  such as cash  investments  loans and deposits  their values are less sensitive to the effects of inflation than to changing interest rates  which do not necessarily change in accordance with inflation rates 
the corporation attempts to control the impact of interest rate fluctuations by managing the relationship between its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities
