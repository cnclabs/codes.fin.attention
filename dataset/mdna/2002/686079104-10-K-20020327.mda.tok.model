to achieve these goals  the company is developing additional product offerings and extending its market from the western united states to a national marketing presence 
the company s operating results were positively affected in by  among other things  increased demand for welded pipe products 
however  increased pricing pressure in plate products continued in as a consequence  the company continues to emphasize its sales and marketing efforts on both specialty and commodity steel plate products 
the specialty and commodity plate markets have been impacted by both new sources of domestic supply and continued imports from foreign suppliers  which has adversely affected average selling prices for the company s plate products 
high fixed costs motivate steel producers to maintain high output levels even in the face of falling prices  thereby increasing further downward pressures on selling prices 
the domestic steel industry and the company s business are highly cyclical in nature and these factors have adversely affected the profitability of the company 
on march   president bush announced the imposition of restrictions on a wide range of steel imports for three years  including a tariff on steel plate and hot rolled coil and a tariff on imports of steel slabs in excess of million tons in year one 
the tariffs on steel plate  coil  and slabs decline to in year two and in year three 
the tariffs for steel slabs are for imports in excess of million tons in year two and million tons in year three 
imports from mexico  a large exporter of slab to the us  and canada and certain developing countries are exempted from these restrictions 
this action is expected to reduce the supply of certain steel products available on the us market  thereby increasing the prices domestic steel manufacturers can charge for those products 
the company expects these restrictions will not materially impact either the supply or the cost of steel slabs  which it purchases on the open market to process into steel plate and coil 
oregon steel believes these restrictions will assist it in increasing profitability 
the legality of these restrictions may be challenged before the world trade organization 
similarly  the president may adjust these restrictions or lift them in their entirety  depending on economic and industry conditions 
accordingly  these restrictions may not remain in place for the entire three year period 
the company expects to ship approximately million tons of product during the oregon steel division anticipates that it will ship more than  tons of welded pipe and approximately  tons of plate and coil products during the increase in anticipated welded pipe shipments is due primarily to the kern river expansion project  which will require production of more than  tons 
the company expects that this order will be completed and shipped by the end of the rmsm division anticipates that it will ship approximately  tons of rail  approximately  tons of rod and bar and approximately  tons of other products 
accordingly  the company believes it is well positioned for an upturn in the steel cycle and expects revenue and cash flow growth in critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates 
this includes allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this provides a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and these differences may be material 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory 
the company s inventories  consisting of raw materials  semi finished and finished products  are stated at the lower of average cost or market 
environmental liabilities 
all material environmental remediation liabilities for non capital expenditures  which are both probable and estimable  are recorded in the financial statements based on current technologies and current environmental standards at the time of evaluation 
adjustments are made when additional information is available that suggests different remediation methods or when estimated time periods are changed  thereby affecting the total cost 
the best estimate of the probable cost within a range is recorded  however  if there is no best estimate  the low end of the range is recorded and the range is disclosed 
even though the company has established certain reserves for environmental remediation  additional remedial measures may be required by environmental authorities and additional environmental hazards  necessitating further remedial expenditures  may be asserted by these authorities or private parties 
accordingly  the costs of remedial measures may exceed the amounts reserved 
litigation liabilities 
all material litigation liabilities  which are both probable and estimable  are recorded in the financial statements based on the nature of the litigation  progress of the case  and opinions of management and legal counsel on the outcome 
adjustments are made when additional information is available that alters opinions of management and legal counsel on the outcome of the litigation 
the best estimate of the probable cost within a range is recorded  however  if there is no best estimate  the low end of the range is recorded and the range is disclosed 
deferred taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates 
tax credits are recognized as a reduction of income tax expense in the year the credit arises 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized 
comparison of to sales 
consolidated sales for of million increased million  or  from sales of million for included in sales are million in electricity sales and million in freight revenue 
included in sales is million in electricity sales and million in freight revenue 
the company does not expect any sales of electricity in revenues from product sales increased to million in from million in shipments were down at  tons for compared to  tons for however  the average product selling price per ton increased from in to in growth in both product sales and related average selling prices were due primarily by the shift in product mix from plate and coil products to welded and seamless pipe products 
freight revenue increased in response to product sales growth  as well as the product mix and customer preference on shipping 
oregon steel division 
for  the division shipped  tons of plate  coil and welded pipe products  compared to  tons in this decrease was due to a weakness in market demand and also due  in large part  to the day temporary curtailment at the portland mill during august of this curtailment was in response to the plate market decline 
despite the decline in total shipments  average selling price per ton  net of revenues from the electricity sales and shipping revenues  increased in to from in the prior year 
the increase was in large part due to greater mix of higher priced welded pipe products attributable to the increased pipe orders at the napa pipe mill 
the company anticipates that the sale of welded pipe will continue to account for a substantial portion of the division s product sales in the foreseeable future 
also included in sales is million in electricity sales 
the company sold approximately of excess power load in its melting facility at the portland mill back to the local utility under an electricity exchange contract  which has since expired 
rmsm division 
for  the division shipped  tons  compared to  tons in the increase was due to higher shipments of seamless pipe and rod and bar products  partially offset by decreased rail shipments caused by capital program reductions by the major railroads 
average product selling price per ton increased to in from in the shift of product mix to seamless pipe in was the principal reason for the improved pricing  as seamless pipe has the highest selling price per ton of all the division s products 
due to the adverse market conditions in the prior year  no seamless products were shipped during the first nine months of because the operation was temporarily shut down 
while performance of seamless products for the first half of was strong  market conditions again deteriorated as demand from oil and gas distributors decreased toward the second half of the year  due to significant decline of oil and natural gas prices 
as a result  the seamless mill was temporarily shut down in november and remains shut down 
also included in sales is million in electricity sales 
gross profits 
gross profit was million  or  for compared to million  or  for the increase of million in gross profit was primarily related to the increased sales of high priced welded pipe and seamless pipe products 
additionally  the sale of electricity positively impacted gross profit margin 
this increase in gross profit was partially offset by continued manufacturing overhead costs at the portland mill that did not decline with the lower melt shop production that occurred as a result of the sale of electricity back to the local utility 
settlement of litigation 
in  the company recorded a million gain from litigation settlements with various graphite electrode suppliers 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a of million for increased by  from million for sg a expenses increased as a percentage of total sales to in from in the increase was due in part to million in additional seamless pipe commission fees for  as compared to commission fees paid in when the seamless mill was shut down for the majority of that year 
in addition  shipping costs increased  from million in to million in this was a direct result of higher volume of shipments on welded and seamless pipe in the remaining increase from the prior year was due to higher general and administrative costs 
this included an increase in bad debt expense of million and an increase in reserves for environmental and other legal expenses of million 
interest expense 
total interest expense increased  or  to million in  compared to million in the increase in interest expense in was primarily due to the acceleration of amortized loan fees  additional loan fees  and higher interest costs associated with the amendment of the company s credit facility in the third and fourth quarters of income tax expense 
effective income tax benefit rate was and for and  respectively 
the effective income tax rate for varied principally from the combined state and federal statutory rate due to the adjustments created by structural changes in the company s foreign operations and non deductible fines and penalties

consolidated sales for of million decreased million  or  from sales of million for included in sales is million in electricity sales and freight revenue of million 
included in sales is million in freight revenue 
revenues from product sales decreased to million in from million in shipments were down at  tons for compared to  tons for the average product selling price per ton declined from for to for the decrease in product sales and related average selling price  primarily resulted from the shift in product mix from welded pipe products to plate and coil products and declining average selling prices per ton for plate and welded pipe offset in part by higher average selling prices achieved on rail  seamless pipe and rod and bar products 
freight revenues decreased as a result of decreased product sales 
oregon steel division 
for  the division shipped  tons of plate  coil and welded pipe products at an average product selling price per ton of compared to  tons with an average product selling price per ton of for the decline in the average product selling price results primarily from the decrease in the percentage of higher priced welded pipe products and a decrease in the average product selling price for both plate and welded pipe 
the decreased shipments were the result of the decrease in welded pipe shipments  which were negatively affected by the completion of the alliance pipeline contract in and by a weak domestic welded pipe market 
rmsm division 
for  the division shipped  tons at an average product selling price per ton of compared to  tons at an average selling price per ton of for the increase in average product selling price resulted primarily from the shift in product mix to higher priced rail products from rod and bar products and an increase in the average product selling price for all of the division s product lines for as compared to seamless pipe was particularly affected  with the average selling price increasing by per ton as compared to the previous year 
the seamless pipe mill restarted operations in october after being idled in may  in response to the market opportunities created by the activity in oil and gas drilling in the western united states and canada 
gross profits 
gross profit was million  or  for compared to million  or for the million decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the reduction in welded pipe shipments for  driven by a lack of market demand  which led to decreases in both volume of shipments and average selling price per ton for welded pipe 
also  the average gross profit per ton for the company s plate products was reduced due to declining average selling prices for as compared to offsetting these decreases were improved average margins for the company s rod and bar products  as the company was able to sell a greater percentage of specialty rod products for as compared to the effect of restarting the seamless mill also mitigated the decrease in gross profit  as the seamless mill was reopened with minimal start up costs in  as opposed to the significant shutdown and severance costs incurred in when operation of the mill was suspended 
settlement of litigation 
the company recorded a million gain for from litigation settlements with various graphite electrode suppliers 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses at million for decreased by from million for  primarily due to decreased shipping costs and reduced costs resulting from a reduction in workforce at the napa pipe mill 
sg a expenses increased as a percentage of sales to for from for  primarily due to the decrease in sales revenue exceeding the corresponding declines in volume of product shipped 
profit participation 
profit participation plan expense was  for compared to million for the decrease in reflects the negative operating results of the oregon steel division in interest expense 
total interest expense for was unchanged from at million  however  the interest cost before capitalized interest was lower at million for as com pared to million for the lower interest cost is primarily the result of a reduction in average outstanding debt principal for as compared to  but was partially offset by an increase in the company s average borrowing rate 
income tax expense 
the company s effective benefit rate for state and federal taxes for was as compared to an income tax rate of for liquidity and capital resources at december   the company s liquidity  comprised of cash  cash equivalents  and funds available under its revolving credit agreement  amended effective november  amended credit agreement  totaled approximately million  compared to million at december  cash flow provided by operations for was million compared to cash flow used in operations of million in the items primarily affecting the million increase in cash flows were the decrease in net loss in million  a non cash provision for deferred taxes recorded in million  a smaller increase in inventories million in versus million in  and a decrease in net receivables in of million versus an increase in of million 
as an offset  operating liabilities increased million in versus a million increase in net working capital at december  decreased million compared to december   reflecting a million increase in current assets offset by a million increase in current liabilities 
the increase in current assets was primarily due to increased cash and deferred tax assets million and million  respectively 
an offset to the increase in current assets was a million decrease in net accounts receivable due to timing of payments by customers 
the accounts receivable for the year ended december   as measured in average daily sales outstanding  remained relatively unchanged at days  as compared to days for the year ended december  the increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in short term debt and current portion of long term debt million 
as the company s amended credit agreement will expire in less than one year  the amount outstanding  approximately million  was reclassified from non current debt to current debt 
additionally  a million minimum pension liability adjustment at year end and a million increase for environmental reserves contributed to the change in current liabilities 
generally weak financial market conditions resulted in poor investment returns in the pension plans for the year  thus causing pension assets to be lower than actuarial liabilities and requiring an additional liability to be recorded 
the increase for environmental reserves were in relation to the expected settlements with the epa and cdphe at the rmsm division

these actions would likely have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the company faces potential costs and liabilities associated with environmental compliance and remediation issues and the labor dispute at the pueblo mill 
see business environmental matters and business labor dispute for a description of those matters 
any costs or liabilities in excess of those expected by the company could have a material adverse effect on the company
