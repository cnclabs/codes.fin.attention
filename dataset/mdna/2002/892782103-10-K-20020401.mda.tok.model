see further discussion below 
vessel capacity utilization on the core continental us to puerto rico traffic lane was during  compared to during the market to and from puerto rico in was again characterized by increasing competitive activity throughout the year 
the excess vessel capacity in the market was exacerbated by market volume reductions that resulted in overall market volume of trailers and containers declining in with the largest decline in the northbound segment 
the company decreased its overall market share of freight moving in trailers or containers in both directions to in from in  with all of that decrease coming from reduced share of market in the northbound segment 
for  the company s market share was southbound and northbound compared to southbound and northbound in all of these market share figures are based on freight moving in trailers and containers and exclude cars and other wheeled vehicles moving southbound where the company has a market share generally above

through march   npr navieras continues to operate its regular service 
at the end of the fourth quarter of the company discontinued its weekly northeast service between newark  new jersey and san juan  puerto rico and implemented other operational changes to improve its performance 
these changes primarily relate to concentrating the company s mainland vessel operations in jacksonville and discontinuing direct vessel service from the northeast newark  nj 
certain key customers that utilized the northeast sailing have transitioned cargo previously handled from the northeast to the company s jacksonville service 
the direct northeast sailing represented approximately of the company s total vessel capacity  but was significantly less in terms of actual volume and revenue 
of the three weekly sailings to puerto rico operated by the company during the first nine months of  the northeast segment was the most under utilized with southbound and northbound capacity utilization of and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  for the company s jacksonville sailings 
operating expenses increased million  or from million in to million for this increase was due to an increase in salary  wages and benefits of  due to increases in healthcare expense and workers compensation insurance  an increase in purchased transportation of  primarily due to increased tug charter hire expense related to the additional tug required for the weekly newark service  an increase in operation and maintenance of million primarily due to the dry docking expense associated with the two roll on roll off barges 
the company elected to fully expense the cost of the dry dockings in the first and second quarter of totaling million rather than capitalize such expenses and amortize them over the period between dry dockings 
while the company believes that this conservative treatment is the preferred method under sec guidelines  it may not be the prevailing industry standard used by other shipping companies  including competitors of the company 
operation and maintenance expense was also affected by increased maintenance expense on company owned trucks  partially offset by less stevedoring expense due to lower volumes 
operating expenses were further affected by asset impairments consisting of million in vessel related charges  write down of  goodwill of and  of revenue equipment charges 
operating expenses were also impacted by restructuring charges for the northeast service shutdown of million  an increase in taxes and licenses of  due to increased intangible tax on equipment and an accrual for the settlement of a sales tax dispute in puerto rico  an increase in insurance and claims of  primarily due to increased premiums for hull and machinery and personal injury insurance  an increase in other operating expenses of million primarily the result of an increase of million in bad debt expense  partially offset by a decrease of  in fuel expense due to reduced fuel prices 
as a result  the company s operating ratio increased to during from during interest expense net decreased to million in from million in primarily due to lower interest rates on the company s floating rate indebtedness 
as a result of the factors described above the company reported a net loss of million for compared to net loss of million in known trends during first quarter of as previously discussed  during the fourth quarter of the company discontinued its northeast service 
additionally  the company has off hired or sold excess tractor and trailer equipment and reduced headcount 
the company now focuses all of its vessel capacity over jacksonville  florida  which has significantly reduced its operating expenses 
preliminary monthly operating results for indicate both increased volume and revenue compared to company expectations 
in addition  those preliminary results indicate a reduction in operating expenses in excess of the company s initial estimate of such cost reductions 
as a result the company expects first quarter results from operations to be a significantly reduced loss as compared to both the first quarter of and the fourth quarter of year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues increased million  or  to million during from million during this increase was due to a million or increase in total puerto rico revenue to million through the utilization of additional capacity in the puerto rico market 
non puerto rico domestic revenue increased  or compared to core trailer volume to puerto rico increased in compared to  and total car and other volume decreased compared to as a result  core trailer revenue to puerto rico increased and car and other revenue decreased compared to revenue from shipper owned or leased equipment moving to puerto rico decreased from revenue from northbound shipments from puerto rico decreased from while overall volume to and from puerto rico increased in  related revenue increased only  million or 
compared to  implying an overall yield reduction of 
this significant yield deterioration was the result of continuing rate pressure as the competitive conditions in the us to puerto rico traffic lane intensified 
these intense competitive conditions are the result of excess vessel capacity serving the trade 
the over capacity in the trade has been exacerbated by a contraction in volume in the overall market during vessel capacity deployed on the core continental us to puerto rico traffic lane increased during compared to vessel capacity utilization on the core continental us to puerto rico traffic lane was during  compared to during the market to and from puerto rico in was characterized by increasing competitive activity throughout the year 
the excess vessel capacity in the market was exacerbated by market volume reductions that resulted in overall market volume declining in while the company increased its overall market share of freight moving in trailers or containers to in from in  the highly competitive market conditions resulted in an reduction in yield

at the beginning of the fourth quarter of a fourth triplestack box carrier was utilized to provide weekly service for the northeast service 
operating expenses for increased million or from million in to million 
this increase was due to an increase in expenses associated with an overall increase in puerto rico volume  including the expansion of the company s northeast service 
the increase in overall volume leads to additional variable costs associated with handling such volume 
the expansion of the company s northeast service required the use of an additional tug barge unit with a concomitant increase in fuel and operating and maintenance expenses 
the combination of additional volume and an additional tug barge unit in operation resulted in a million increase in operating and maintenance expenses and a million increase in fuel expense  partially offset by a million increase in fuel surcharges included in revenue  and a million reduction in other operating expenses 
all operating expenses were affected by the increase in volume and the addition of an additional tug barge unit in service to expand the company s northeast service 
as a result  the company s operating ratio increased to during from during interest expense net increased to million in from million in the company has recorded various deferred tax assets in prior years 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future years 
as a result of the net losses incurred in recent years  a valuation allowance has been established based on the provisions of sfas no

during the year ended december   the company changed its method of accounting for periodic vessel dry docking 
prior to the change  the company accrued estimates of future vessel dry docking costs 
the company now will expense these costs as incurred 
this change resulted in a gain of  net of income taxes of  for the year ended december  as a result of the factors described above the company reported a net loss of million for compared to net loss of million in liquidity and capital resources net cash used by operations was million in compared to net cash used by operations of million in this represented a deterioration of million from net cash provided by investing activities of  in reflects million in proceeds from the sale of older trailer equipment  partially offset by  of capital expenditures  which were primarily attributable to payments for additional containers and chassis 
net cash provided from financing activities was million compared to million in representing an increase of million 
net cash provided from financing activities of million consisted of million in notes payable to an affiliate  consisting of million in cash advances and million in deferred charterhire  borrowings of  on notes payable under the company s borrowing facility  partially offset by payments of million on notes payable 
at december   cash amounted to  working capital was a negative million  including million of the company s borrowings that are subject to acceleration and therefore shown as current liabilities  and stockholders equity was a negative million 
due to the company s financial performance in  it is currently in default under financial and other covenants contained in its credit agreement with its senior lender 
while the senior lender continues to fund draws under the company s revolving line of credit and the company is in discussions with the senior lender regarding the revolving line of credit  no assurance can be made that the lender will continue to do so 
the company depends on its secured revolving line of credit to maintain its liquidity  therefore continued access to the revolving line of credit is critical to the company s cash flow needs and denial of access to such funds would have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to operate and its financial condition by denying the company necessary liquidity to fund its operations 
as of december   the company had million drawn under the credit facility against a borrowing base of million that is secured by net receivables of million 
additionally  a default to the company s senior lender would result in cross defaults in other loan and or lease documents that could result in acceleration of such debts or return of leased assets

most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operation 
the company expects that inflation will affect its costs no more than it affects those of other truckload and marine carriers 
seasonality the company s marine operations are subject to the seasonality of the puerto rico freight market where shipments are generally reduced during the first calendar quarter and increased during the fourth calendar quarter of each year in anticipation of christmas

covenant defaults under certain loan agreements 
the operating performance of the company has resulted in a number of covenant defaults under certain of the company s loan agreements 
the company is current on all principal and interest payments to its lenders but the violation of the financial covenants  unless waived by the lenders  can result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding 
in such an event the company would be unable to pay all amounts outstanding without additional financing and no assurance can be given that the company could secure such refinancing 
therefore acceleration by any of the company s lenders could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operation as well as the price of the company s stock 
the company s primary sources of working capital are cash flows from operations and borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
there were million in borrowings outstanding under our million revolving credit facility december  this was effectively all that was available under the credit facility s borrowing base 
the company has consistently borrowed all that was available under the credit facility s borrowing base since the inception of the credit facility and continues to do so on a weekly or daily basis 
due to the performance of the company  the company is in violation of both its financial covenants under the revolving credit facility and the related term loan  under which million was outstanding at december  the company is in violation of both the fixed charge coverage ratio and the minimum tangible net worth covenant 
the company continues to work with the lender to obtain waivers of past defaults and in setting of new covenants that the company can comply with and the lender continues to advance funds under the revolving credit facility despite the covenant violations described above 
no assurance can be made that such negotiations will be successful and that such advances will continue to be made 
refusal of the lender to honor advance requests of the company would have a material adverse affect on the company s business and threaten the company s ability to continue operations 
assistance from affiliates the company has engaged and continues to engage in transactions with two affiliates kadampanattu corp 
and the estate of malcom p 
mclean

on an unsecured basis  deferred charterhire or forgiven charterhire 
for the year ended december   the company accrued million in charterhire net of the forgiveness of charterhire of million in the first quarter of related to expenses incurred due to the required periodic drydocking of both ro ro vessels 
during  kadampanattu corp 
deferred million of charterhire and advanced million in unsecured loans to the company 
during the first quarter of  the company accrued million of charterhire due to kadampanattu corp 
and made cash payments of million and deferred at december   the outstanding payable amount to kadampanattu corp 
was million all of which was subordinated to the rights of the company s lender under the revolving credit facility and related term loan and cannot be repaid until that facility is paid in full 
however  such payable amount to kadampanattu corp 
is due by its terms at january   and unless rescheduled or refinanced the company would be unable to pay such amounts 
the company does not anticipate any unsecured borrowings or charter hire forgiveness from kadampanattu corp 
through the remainder of calendar but may utilize deferrals similar to that granted in the first quarter of no assurances can be made that kadampanattu corp 
or any successor to kadampanattu corp 
will agree to the any deferrals beyond during the first quarter of  the company entered in to a loan and security agreement with the estate of m 
p 
mclean under which the company borrowed million to be repaid in two years 
the loan was secured primarily by unencumbered trailer equipment

the ceo of the company has agreed to a reduction 
such amounts are to be repaid no later than december  vendor relationships due to the company s financial performance during and the resulting lack of liquidity the company is currently beyond its historical payment terms with many of its vendors and lessors 
the company expects to make continuing progress through the calendar year the loss of certain of these vendors would have a detrimental effect on the ability of the company to conduct its operations 
nasdaq listing requirements due to the company s financial performance during and its current per share market price the company is not in compliance with either of nasdaq s maintenance standards necessary for continued listing on the nasdaq national market 
the company has been notified by nasdaq that if it cannot demonstrate compliance with either of the maintenance standards by may  its staff will provide written notification that the company s common stock will be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
upon such notification the company could appeal such determination to the listing qualification panel

market conditions 
the market in which the company operates  the united states to puerto rico trade lane  remains hyper competitive with significant over capacity 
beginning in  the company reduced its capacity by ceasing to operate its northeast service 
the company s competitors have not reduced their capacity 
one of the company s competitors  npr  has been under chapter bankruptcy protection since march and continues to operate its normal schedule of three sailings per week 
published reports indicate that csx lines  another of the company s competitors  is actively being offered for sale 
the over capacity in the puerto rico trade results in lower vessel utilization and lower freight rates 
no assurance can be made that market conditions will improve or that competitive pressures will not increase 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting generally accepted in the united states of america principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies which are described below 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
long lived assets 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of long lived asset  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long lived assets 
due to the continued operating losses independent appraisals were used to determine the appropriateness of the carrying values 
derivative financial instrument 
the company has entered into an interest rate swap for interest rate risk exposure management that is accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and sfas no 
 an amendment to sfas no 
sfas no 
and sfas no 
are collectively referred to herein as sfas no 

the accounting for hedge effectiveness measured at least quarterly based on the relative change in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness  as defined by sfas no 
 is recognized immediately into earnings 
the company s interest rate swap does not qualify as an effective fair value hedge  therefore the ineffective portion of the hedged transaction has been recognized into earnings 
the differential to be paid or received under these agreements is accrued consistently with the terms of the agreement and is recognized in interest expense over the term of the related debt 
income taxes 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with this nol if it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize it to offset future taxes 
due to the size of the company s net operating loss carryforward in relation to our history of unprofitable operations  we have not recognized any of this net deferred tax asset 
we currently provide for income taxes only to the extent that we expect to pay cash taxes primarily state taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax for current income 
it is possible  however  that we could be profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the nol carryforward 
upon reaching such a conclusion  we would immediately record the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset at that time and would then provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates  which would approximate under current tax rates 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although our cash tax payments would remain unaffected until the benefit of the nol is utilized 
new accounting pronouncments 
in  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  was issued 
under the provisions of statement  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis 
the company will adopt this standard in the first quarter of its indefinite lived intangible assets relate to costs to obtain a trademark on the vehicle modular transport vtm 
the company believes there to be no material effect as a result of sfas the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgement in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgement in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page f of this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles
