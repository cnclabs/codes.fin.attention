item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
significant accounting policies valuation of investments portfolio investments are carried at fair value with the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation included in the determination of net assets 
valuations of portfolio securities are preformed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and the financial reporting policies of the securities and exchange commission sec 
the applicable methods prescribed by such principles and policies are described below publicly traded portfolio securities investments in companies whose securities are publicly traded are valued at their quoted market price at the close of business on the valuation date  less a discount to reflect the estimated effects of restrictions on the sale of such securities valuation discount  if applicable 
privately held portfolio securities the fair value of investments for which no market exists of the investments held by the fund at december  is determined on the basis of procedures established in good faith by the board of directors of the fund 
as a general principle  the current fair value of an investment would be the amount the fund might reasonably expect to receive for it upon its current sale 
appraisal valuations are necessarily subjective and the management company s estimate of values may differ materially from amounts actually received upon the disposition of portfolio securities generally  cost is the primary factor used to determine fair value until significant developments affecting the portfolio company such as results of operations or changes in general market conditions provide a basis for use of an appraisal valuation 
thereafter  portfolio investments are carried at appraised values as determined quarterly by the management company  subject to the approval of the board of directors 
appraisal valuations are based upon such factors as a portfolio company s earnings  cash flow and net worth  the market prices for similar securities of comparable companies  an assessment of the company s current and future financial prospects and various other factors and assumptions 
in the case of unsuccessful operations  the appraisal may be based upon liquidation value 
most of the fund s common equity investments are appraised at a multiple of free cash flow generated by the portfolio company in its most recent fiscal year  less outstanding funded indebtedness and other senior securities such as preferred stock 
projections of current year free cash flow may be utilized and adjustments for non recurring items are considered 
multiples utilized are estimated based on the management company s experience in the private company marketplace  and are necessarily subjective in nature 
most of the portfolio companies utilize a high degree of leverage 
the banking environment currently has resulted in pressure on several of these companies to reduce the amount of leverage in order to maintain such financing 
from time to time  portfolio companies are in default of certain covenants in their loan agreements 
in the event a portfolio company cannot generate adequate cash flow to meet the principal and interest payments on such indebtedness or is not successful in refinancing the debt upon its maturity  the fund s investment could be reduced or eliminated through foreclosure on the portfolio company s assets or the portfolio company s reorganization or bankruptcy 
when the management company has a reasonable belief that the portfolio company will be able to restructure the loan agreements to adjust for any defaults  the portfolio company s securities continue to be valued assuming that the company is a going concern 
the fund may also use  when available  third party transactions in a portfolio company s securities as the basis of valuation the private market method 
the private market method will be used only with respect to completed transactions or firm offers made by sophisticated  independent investors 
the fair values of debt securities  which are generally held to maturity  are determined on the basis of the terms of the debt securities and the financial conditions of the issuer 
certificates of deposit purchased by the fund generally will be valued at their face value  plus interest accrued to the date of valuation 
because of the inherent uncertainty of the valuation of portfolio securities which do not have readily ascertainable market values  the fund s estimate of fair value may significantly differ from the value that would have been used had a ready market existed for the securities 
on a daily basis  the fund adjusts its net asset value for the changes in the value of its publicly held securities and material changes in the value of its private securities and reports those amounts to lipper analytical services  inc weekly and daily net asset values appear in various publications  including barron s and the wall street journal 
investment transactions investment transactions are recorded on the accrual method 
realized gains and losses on investments sold are computed on a specific identification basis 
cash flows for purposes of the statements of cash flows  the fund considers all highly liquid temporary cash investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
income taxes no provision for federal income taxes has been made in the accompanying financial statements as the fund has qualified for pass through treatment as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of as such  all net income is allocable to the stockholders for inclusion in their respective tax returns 
net capital losses are not allocable to the shareholders but can be carried over to offset future earnings of the fund 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the fund had  of its assets invested in portfolio securities of companies  and has committed to invest up to an additional  in eight of such companies under certain circumstances 
the follow on commitments include  in stand by letters of credit to enable a portfolio company to maintain its insurance program 
of the current commitments  the fund expects to advance or invest no more than million in current temporary cash investments  anticipated future investment income  proceeds from borrowings  and proceeds from the sale of existing portfolio securities are believed to be sufficient to finance these commitments 
at december   the fund had  in borrowings plus  in letters of credit outstanding on a  revolving line of credit loan from a bank 
the revolving credit loan agreement is scheduled to expire on july  the fund expects to renew the credit facility on or before such date 
if the fund is unable to maintain its revolving line of credit it may be required to sell a portion of its investment portfolio when it may be disadvantageous to do so

at december   the fund had  of its total assets of  invested in temporary cash investments consisting of money market securities 
this amount includes proceeds of  from a note payable to a bank that is utilized to enable the fund to achieve adequate diversification to maintain its pass through tax status as a regulated investment company 
such amount was repaid to the bank on january  the fund has the ability to borrow funds and issue forms of senior securities representing indebtedness or stock  such as preferred stock  subject to certain restrictions 
net investment income and net realized gains from the sales of portfolio investments are intended to be distributed at least annually  to the extent such amounts are not reserved for payment of expenses and contingencies or to make follow on or new investments 
management believes that the availability under its line of credit  as well as the ability to sell its investments in publicly traded securities  are adequate to provide for any expenses and contingencies of the fund 
the fund reserves the right to retain net long term capital gains in excess of net short term capital losses for reinvestment or to pay contingencies and expenses 
such retained amounts  if any  will be taxable to the fund as long term capital gains and stockholders will be able to claim their proportionate share of the federal income taxes paid by the fund on such gains as a credit against their own federal income tax liabilities 
stockholders will also be entitled to increase the adjusted tax basis of their fund shares by the difference between their undistributed capital gains and their tax credit

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the fund is subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates with respect to its investments in debt securities and its outstanding debt payable  as well as changes in marketable equity security prices 
the fund does not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate any of these risks 
the return on the fund s investments is generally not affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
the fund s investment in portfolio securities consists of some fixed rate debt securities 
since the debt securities are generally priced at a fixed rate  changes in interest rates do not directly impact interest income 
in addition  changes in market interest rates are not typically a significant factor in the fund s determination of fair value of these debt securities  since the securities are generally held to maturity 
their fair values are determined on the basis of the terms of the debt security and the financial condition of the issuer 
borrowings under the fund s and million line of credit  as of december  and  respectively  expose the fund to certain market risks 
based on the average outstanding borrowings under its line of credit for the year ended december  and  respectively  of approximately  and  a change of one percent in the interest rate would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately  and  this change would have resulted in a change of and in the net asset value per share at december  and  respectively 
the fund did not enter into its credit facility for trading purposes and the line of credit carries interest at a pre agreed upon percentage point spread from either the prime rate or the day libor rate 
in addition  there were no significant changes to the factors that affect market risk from to a major portion of the fund s investment portfolio consists of debt and equity investments in private companies 
modest changes in public market equity prices generally do not significantly impact the estimated fair value of these investments 
however  significant changes in market equity prices can have a longer term effect on valuations of private companies  which could affect the carrying value and the amount and timing of gains realized on these investments 
a portion of the fund s investment portfolio also consists of common stocks in publicly traded companies 
these investments are directly exposed to equity price risk  in that a hypothetical ten percent change in these equity prices would result in a similar percentage change in the fair value of these securities
