historical amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current categories 
recent developments on april   the board of directors approved a plan to discontinue operations of the voice and data communications group vdcg  which offered secure satellite communication equipment and satellite navigation systems

the purchase price is subject to a post closing adjustment in the event that the tangible net assets of spsg as of the closing date are less than approximately million 
ultimate resolution of this adjustment is still under review 
the agreement also provides for a potential deferred payment of up to million by armor to kroll if a gross profit target is achieved by spsg for the year ended december  see note a of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we do not believe that the gross profit target was achieved 
on september   kroll converted approximately million in armor common stock to cash

the note holders may at any time prior to one day before the earlier of the maturity date or the redemption date  convert all or a portion of the principal amount of the notes into kroll common stock at the conversion price of per share

in addition to the stated interest  the discount will be amortized as non cash interest expense over the expected year life of the notes

restructuring of operations due to the number of acquisitions kroll has completed since  integration of the operations of the acquired companies with existing operations became a strategic initiative for kroll s management 
as part of this initiative  management evaluated its business segments to ensure that its core businesses within the segments were operating efficiently 
as a result of management s evaluation  the decision was made to close several less profitable operating facilities so that kroll could focus on integrating existing facilities with the newly acquired businesses

critical accounting policies kroll s significant accounting policies  including the assumptions and judgments underlying them  are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
however  some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the preparation of our financial statements  and as a result they are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty 
in applying these policies  management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in calculating estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
kroll s significant accounting policies include the following 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized as the services are performed pursuant to the applicable contractual arrangements 
revenue related to time and materials arrangements is recognized in the period in which the services are performed 
revenue from standard hourly rate engagements is recognized as hours are incurred and revenue from standard daily rate arrangements is recognized at amounts represented by the agreed upon billing amounts as incurred 
revenue related to fixed price arrangements are recognized based upon costs incurred as a percentage of the estimated total direct costs of the respective arrangements 
the impact of any revisions in estimated total revenue and direct contract costs is recognized in the period in which they become known 
kroll records either billed or unbilled accounts receivable based on case by case invoicing determinations 
databases 
databases are capitalized costs incurred in obtaining information from third party providers 
kroll utilizes this information to create and maintain its proprietary and non proprietary databases 
because of the continuing accessibility of the information and its usefulness to future investigative procedures  the cost of acquiring the information is capitalized and amortized over a five year period

liquidity and capital resources general 
kroll historically has met its operating cash needs by utilizing borrowings under its credit arrangements and net proceeds from public offerings to supplement cash provided by operations  excluding non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization 
credit facilities and senior notes 
on march   kroll entered into an amended and restated loan agreement  which would have expired on may  if not terminated earlier as described below  to provide for a revolving credit facility that initially amounted to million 
the agreement also provided for a letter of credit facility of up to million of transactional letters of credit 
letters of credit cannot be issued or renewed with a maturity date beyond may  the agreement was secured by substantially all assets of kroll and its subsidiaries along with a pledge of the stock of essentially all the subsidiaries  all of which jointly and severally guaranteed obligations under the agreement 
the revolving credit facility required quarterly reductions of approximately million on september  and approximately million on each of december  and march  in the amount that may be borrowed under the facility and  if necessary  corresponding principal repayments to the adjusted levels 
in addition  the net proceeds from any lender approved sale of assets in excess of million per transaction or million per fiscal year was to be paid proportionately to the revolving credit facility lender and to the holders of kroll s outstanding senior notes discussed below  with a corresponding reduction in the total permitted borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
this included the net proceeds from the sale to armor and any proceeds from sales of kroll s stock ownership in securify or other assets in excess of the threshold amounts 
borrowings under kroll s revolving credit facility were approximately million at december  and borrowings under kroll s senior notes were approximately million at december  both the revolving credit facility and senior notes were retired on november  in connection with the amended credit facility  kroll entered into amended and restated agreements with the holders of its senior notes 
these agreements were also secured by substantially all assets of kroll and its subsidiaries and a pledge of the stock of essentially all the subsidiaries and were jointly and severally guaranteed by essentially all the subsidiaries 
the amended and restated senior note agreements required total principal payments of  on september  and  on each of december  and march  the balance was payable at maturity in may  but maturity was accelerated to may  if kroll s revolving credit agreement was not renewed and  as described below  further accelerated upon closing of the transaction with armor 
the september  payment referenced above was made in october the amended bank loan and senior note agreements contained substantially identical financial covenants which  among other restrictions  required the maintenance of certain financial ratios and other financial requirements  including an interest coverage ratio  net worth minimums and minimum quarterly ebitda that required kroll to effectively break even before taxes and to generate ebitda of million per quarter 
the agreements also imposed limitations on mergers  acquisitions  stock redemption  additional indebtedness and capital expenditures 
the loan agreement did not permit the declaration or payment of any dividend  other than stock dividends 
kroll was not in compliance with these covenants as of september  as both the facility and the senior notes were retired on november   no adverse consequences resulted from any event of non compliance 
the bank loan agreement and senior notes were further amended as of april  and october  in connection with kroll s agreement to sell the security products and services group to armor

following the closing of the transaction with armor  proceeds from the sale of the armor stock of approximately million and an additional million subsequently received were paid immediately to the revolving credit facility lender and senior note holders in the same percentages 
million remains to be received from armor 
in november  we obtained new financing of million in the form of senior secured subordinated convertible notes due on november   kroll issued million of notes and issued an additional million of notes on november  the notes mature november  and bear interest at the rate of per annum payable semi annually 
however  per annum will accrue on any principal payment that is past due 
kroll may redeem these convertible notes at par plus accrued interest in whole or in part beginning november  provided the note holders have been notified in writing days in advance 
the note holders may  at any time prior to one day before the earlier of the maturity date or the redemption date  convert all or a portion of the principal amount of the notes into kroll common stock at the conversion price of per share 
the million of notes are immediately convertible into  shares of kroll common stock  subject to customary and other anti dilution adjustments 
the notes are secured by the same assets of kroll and its material subsidiaries and the same pledge of stock of certain of kroll s subsidiaries as the credit facility  except that the notes are subordinate to the security interest and rights of the credit facility lender 
the notes contain certain customary covenants  including covenants that prohibit kroll from disposing of any material subsidiary  incurring or permitting to exist any debt other than the credit facility  guaranteeing the obligations of any third party  creating or permitting to exist any material liens on assets of material subsidiaries or entering into a transaction prior to november  that involves a change in control of kroll as defined in the notes 
the notes are payable upon any change in control of kroll at the option of the holders 
the note holders may designate an observer to the board of directors who may serve in this capacity as long as of the notes  or shares into which the notes were converted  are held by the noteholders or investors 
the observer may also attend audit and compensation committee meetings 
in connection with the issuance of the notes kroll recorded a notes discount of approximately million based on the difference between the closing price of its stock on the issuance date and the conversion price 
in addition to the stated interest  the discount will be amortized as non cash interest expense over the expected year life of the notes 
barring early conversion by the noteholders or early redemption by kroll  the average additional non cash interest expense resulting from this discount amortization will be approximately million or per year on million principal see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
a significant portion of the proceeds from the new financing was used to retire kroll s amended bank loan and senior notes 
excess proceeds of approximately million will be utilized for working capital to fund operations

on february   kroll executed agreements with foothill capital corporation to provide a revolving credit facility of up to million  subject to borrowing base limitations  for a term of three years 
borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest  at kroll s election  at a rate per annum equal to a base rate  which will be the prime rate of wells fargo bank  na  plus or libor plus 
during the term of the credit facility  kroll will pay foothill capital a fee equal to the product of per annum and the unused portion of the credit facility 
the credit facility agreement requires kroll to maintain a minimum level of ebitda  and contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt  the creation of any liens on any of kroll s assets  certain acquisitions  distributions to certain subsidiaries and other affirmative and negative covenants customarily contained in debt agreements of this type 
the credit facility is secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of kroll and its material domestic subsidiaries and a pledge of the stock of certain of kroll s subsidiaries 
as of march   there were no amounts borrowed under the credit facility see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements
