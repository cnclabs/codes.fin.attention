critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the application of accounting policies which may require the company to make estimates and assumptions of future events 
in the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company estimates the appropriate carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  which are not readily apparent from other sources 
the primary estimates underlying the company s financial statements include allowances for potential bad debts on accounts and notes receivable  the useful lives and recoverability of its assets  such as property and intangibles  fair values of financial instruments  the realizable value of its tax assets and other matters 
management bases its estimates on certain assumptions  which they believe are reasonable in the circumstances  and actual results could differ from those estimates 
although management does not believe that any change in those assumptions in the near term would have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or the results of operation  differences in actual results could be material to the financial statements 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the company s financials 
below are listed certain policies that management believes are critical 
fixed assets the company annually assesses any impairment in value of long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used 
the company evaluates the possibility of impairment by comparing anticipated undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the related long lived assets 
if such cash flows are less than carrying value the company then reduces the asset to its fair value 
fair value is generally calculated using discounted cash flows 
various factors such as sales growth and operating margins and proceeds from a sale are part of this analysis 
future results could differ from the company s projections with a resulting adjustment to income in such period 
deferred income tax valuation allowance the company provides such allowance due to uncertainty that some of the deferred tax amounts may not be realized 
certain items  such as state and local tax loss carry forwards  are dependent on future earnings or the availability of tax strategies 
future results could require an increase or decrease in the valuation allowance and a resulting adjustment to income in such period
