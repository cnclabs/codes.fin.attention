item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general overview we are a leading provider of secure electronic financial transaction solutions 
we provide financial payment middleware  financial network gateways  outsourcing  and consulting services to financial institutions  retailers and mobile phone operators 
we operate an independent automated teller machine  atm  network of approximately  atms in europe and  until january  the united states 
through our software subsidiary  euronet usa inc formerly  arkansas systems  inc  we offer a suite of integrated software solutions for electronic payment and transaction delivery systems 
we offer comprehensive electronic payment solutions consisting of atm network participation  outsourced atm management solutions and software solutions 
our principal customers are banks and other companies such as retail outlets that require transaction processing services 
with offices worldwide  we offer our solutions in more than countries around the world 
we and our subsidiaries operate in two business segments a segment providing secure processing of financial transactions the processing services segment  and a segment producing application software for the processing of secure electronic financial transactions the software solutions segment 
in addition  our management divides the processing services segment into three sub segments central european sub segment including hungary  poland  the czech republic  croatia  greece and romania  western european sub segment including germany  france and the united kingdom and other processing services sub segment including the united states and unallocated processing center costs 
these business segments  and their sub segments  are supported by a corporate service segment  which provides corporate and other administrative services that are not directly identifiable with the two business segments the corporate services segment 
we evaluate performance based on profit or loss from operations before income taxes not including nonrecurring gains and losses 
we have restated prior period segment information to conform to the current period s presentation see note to the consolidated financial statements business segment information 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows software revenue recognition revenues from software licensing agreement contracts are recognized over the contract term using the percentage of completion method based on the percentage of services that are provided compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the entire contract 
revenue from time and material service contracts is recognized as the services are provided 
revenues from software licensing agreement contracts representing newly released products deemed to have a higher than normal risk of failure during installation are recognized on a completed contract basis whereby revenues and related costs are deferred until the contract is complete 
maintenance revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as services are performed 
revenue in excess of billings on software license agreements contracts is recorded as unbilled receivables and is included in current assets 
billings in excess of revenue on software license agreements contracts are recorded as deferred revenue and is included in current liabilities until such time the above revenue recognition criteria are met 
capitalization of software development costs we apply sfas and in recording research and development costs 
research costs aimed at the discovery of new knowledge with the hope that such knowledge will be useful in developing a new product or service or a new process or technique or in bringing about significant improvement to an existing product or process are expensed as incurred see note to the consolidated financial statements research and development 
development costs aimed at the translation of research findings or other knowledge into a plan or design for a new product or process or for a significant improvement to an existing product or process whether intended for sale or use are capitalized on a product by product basis when technological feasibility is established 
technological feasibility of computer software products is established when we have completed all planning  designing  coding  and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
technological feasibility is evidenced by the existence of a working model of the product or by completion of a detail program design 
the detail program design must a establish that the necessary skills  hardware  and software technology are available to produce the product  b be complete and consistent with the product design  and c have been reviewed for high risk development issues  with any uncertainties related to identified high risk development issues being adequately resolved 
accounting for income taxes we have significant tax loss carryforwards and other temporary differences which are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets realizable in future periods are recorded  net of a valuation allowance based on an assessment of each individual entity s ability to generate sufficient taxable income within an appropriate period 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowances at december  in the current year  profitability has improved in certain countries in which we operate 
when a sufficient history of taxable income has been established in these countries  deferred tax assets increasingly will be considered realizable  and the existing valuation allowances will be reduced 
estimating the impairment of long lived assets we are required to evaluate long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to projected undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets on a discounted cash flow basis 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
future adverse changes in market conditions could result in an inability to recover the carrying amount of an asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december   and overview our total revenues increased by million or to million for from million for such revenues increased by million or to million for from million for the increase in revenues from to was primarily due to two factors a million increase in processing services segment revenues resulting from the increase in transaction volumes in atms owned by us and an increase in the number of atms operated by us during this period  and offset by a decrease of million in software solutions segment revenues 
the increase in revenues from to was primarily due to two factors a million increase in processing services segment revenues resulting from the increase in transaction volumes in atms owned by us and an increase in the number of atms operated by us during this period  and an increase of million in software solutions segment revenues 
revenues for and are discussed more fully in the segment results of operations sections below 
effective november   we entered into an agreement with abn amro under which abn amro agreed to pay us million to terminate an atm management agreement for atms and a card agreement between our hungarian subsidiary and abn amro 
this amount has been included in annual revenue in the fourth quarter the contracts that were terminated would have generated revenues in and of million and million  respectively 
the principal reason for the termination of these agreements was that abn amro merged with k h bank  and k h bank had existing relationships with a competing transaction processing switch service in hungary 
total operating expenses decreased by million or to million for from million for such expenses increased by million or to million for from million for the decrease from to can be broken down by segment as follows a million increase in processing services segment operating costs due to growth in the size of the network operations  a million decrease in the software services segment due to write down of certain intangible assets of million in and reductions in personnel and resources in  and a million decrease in corporate services segment operating costs due to reductions in personnel and resources in the increase from to can be broken down by segment as follows a million increase in processing services segment operating costs due to growth in the size of the network operations  a million increase in software services segment due to the write down of certain intangible assets of million and investment in personnel and resources  and a million increase in corporate services segment operating costs due to the expanded operations 
operating expenses for  and are discussed more fully in the segment results of operations sections below 
we generated operating losses of million for compared to operating losses of million for and million for the change from to was due to the net effect of three factors an million improvement in the operating results which has generated an operating income in our processing services segment  a million decrease in the operating loss from our software solutions segment  and a million decrease in the operating loss from our corporate services segment 
the increased operating loss from to was due to the net effect of three factors a million decrease in the operating loss from our processing services segment  a million increase in the operating loss from our software solutions segment  and a million increase in the operating loss from our corporate services segment

segment results of operations for the years ended december   and in thousands revenues operating income loss year ended december  processing services central europe       western europe       other     total processing services       software solutions       corporate services    inter segment eliminations total       comparison of operating results for the years ended december   and by business segment processing services segment processing services revenues total segment revenues increased by million or to million for from million for total segment revenues increased by million or to million for from million for the increase in revenues in and was due primarily to the significant increase in transaction volume and an increase in the number of atms operated by us during these periods 
we had  atms installed as of december  and  atms installed as of december  we processed million transactions in  and processed million transactions in in the year  our owned and operated atm network increased by atms  or  over to a total of  atms  of which are owned by us and are owned by banks or other financial institutions but operated by us through management agreements 
we processed million transactions for  an increase of million transactions  or  over revenues for the central european sub segment increased by million or to million for from million for revenues for this sub segment increased by million or to million for from million for the increase in revenues in and was largely the result of an increase in the number of atms operated by us over this period 
we increased the number of atms that we operated from  at december  to  at december  and  at december  revenues for the western european sub segment increased by million or to million for from million for revenues for this sub segment increased by million or to million for from million for the increase in revenues in and was largely the result of an increase in the number of atms operated by us over this period 
we increased the number of atms that we operated from at december  to at december  and  at december  during this period we also increased transaction volumes and increased transaction fees in certain markets 
of the net atms added to the network  atms are located in the united kingdom 
our aggressive roll out of atms in the united kingdom during was based on the ability to charge a transaction fee directly to the person using the atms in this market 
the continuance of an aggressive roll out of atms in the united kingdom is dependent on our ability to find additional sites for atms that are capable of highly profitable transaction levels 
certain machines that we have installed recently in the united kingdom had transaction levels that are lower that those of machines installed earlier 
this is partially due to the fact that transaction levels are lower at atm machines at post office sites and at sites at which cash is replenished by merchants 
although these atms are profitable  they are generating returns that are lower than we expected 
we are examining a number of responses to this situation  including using lower cost machines at these sites or reducing our roll out of machines in the united kingdom 
a decision to reduce our rate of roll out of atms or the continuing weakness of performance of certain atms could result in a decrease in growth in our revenues and operating profits 
revenues for the other processing services sub segment increased by million or to million for from million for revenues from these operations increased by million or to million for from million for all revenues from this segment are generated by the dash network located in the united states 
we sold the dash network in january see note to the consolidated financial statements subsequent events and therefore no revenues will be realized from that business for the year as a result  we will no longer report on this sub segment 
of total segment revenue  approximately was attributable to atms owned by us for the year  for and for the year of total transactions processed  approximately were attributable to atms owned by us for the year  for and for the year we expect that in the future there will be a shift from a largely proprietary atm network owned by us to a more balanced mix between proprietary atms and customer owned atms 
we believe that this trend is a positive development and will provide higher marginal returns on investments 
the transaction fees that we charge vary for the three types of atm transactions that are currently processed on our atms cash withdrawals  balance inquiries  and transactions not completed because the relevant card issuer does not give authorization 
transaction fees for cash withdrawals vary from market to market but generally range from to per transaction 
transaction fees for the other two types of transactions are generally substantially less 
transaction fees payable under the electronic recharge solutions sold by us are included in processing services segment revenues and vary substantially from market to market and based upon the specific prepaid solution and the denomination of prepaid hours purchased 
generally the range of transaction fees vary from to per prepaid mobile recharge purchase 
operating expenses total segment operating expenses increased by million or to million for from million for such expenses increased by million or to million for from million for the increases in and were due primarily to costs associated with the growth in the numbers of atms and expansion of our operations during the periods 
we recorded a million write down of certain atm hardware assets associated with the purchase of the budapest bank atm network in may and the service bank atm network in march see note to the consolidated financial statements asset write down 
in addition  we recorded a one time gain in our central european sub segment of million in the gain was related to a change in hungarian law that eliminates a major portion of our liability for import taxes on atm hardware to the hungarian government 
the gain was included as an element of direct operating costs 
the operating expenses for the central european sub segment increased by million or to million for from million for such expenses increased by million or to million for from million for the increase in operating expenses in and was largely the result of an increase in the number of atms operated by us over this period 
we increased the number of atms that we operated from  at december  to  at december  and  at december  the operating expenses for the western european sub segment increased by million or to million for from million for such expenses increased by million or to million for from million for the increase in operating expenses in and was largely the result of an increase in the number of atms operated by us over this period 
we increased the number of atms that we operated from at december  to at december  and  at december  the operating expenses for the other processing services sub segment increased by million or to million for from million for such expenses increased by million or to million for from million for the operating expenses from this segment are generated from the dash network located in the united states and the unallocated costs associated with our processing facilities 
we sold the dash network in january see note to the consolidated financial statements subsequent events 
direct operating costs in the processing services segment consist primarily of the following atm installation costs  atm site rentals  and costs associated with maintaining atms  atm telecommunications  interest on network cash and cash delivery and security services to atms 
such costs increased by million or to million for from million for such costs increased by million or to million for from million for the increase in direct operating costs was primarily attributable to costs was associated with operating the increased number of atms in the network during the periods 
also  intercompany allocations were made to charge the atm operations with transaction switching and bank connection fees associated with the operations central processing center in budapest 
these allocations totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
direct operating costs for include a one time gain of million due to a change in hungarian law that eliminates a major portion of our liability for import taxes on atm hardware 
the components of direct operating costs for  and were year ending december  in thousands atm communication    atm cash filling and interest on network cash    atm maintenance    atm site rental    atm installation transaction processing and atm monitoring    other   total direct operating expenses    as a percentage of network revenue  direct operating costs have continued to fall 
such costs fell from to for and  respectively  to for on a per atm basis the direct operating costs fell from  per atm and  per atm for and  respectively  to  per atm for  an improvement of over on a per transaction basis the direct operating costs fell from per transaction and per transaction for and to per transaction for  an improvement of over costs for segment salaries and benefits increased by million or to million for from million for such expenses increased by million or to million for from million for the increase in the year on year expenses reflect the continued expansion of the operations to western european markets with significantly higher labor costs than central europe as well as some increases in staff levels at the processing center required to maintain quality service in line with the rising transaction volumes 
as a percentage of processing services segment revenue  salaries and benefits fell from and for and  respectively  to for selling  general and administrative costs allocated to the processing services segment decreased million or to million for from million for such expenses decreased million or to million for from million for the cost decrease for the year resulted from the net effect of a million increase in the allocation of costs from the selling  general and administrative line of the budapest processing center to the operating cost line  from million for to million for and a million increase in costs associated with the expansion of our network operations 
the million cost decrease for resulted from the net effect of a million increase in the allocation of costs from the selling  general and administrative line of the budapest processing center to the operating cost line  from million for to million for and a million increase in costs associated with the expansion of our network operations 
depreciation and amortization increased by million or to million for from million for such expenses increased by million or to million for from million for the increases were due primarily to the increase in the number of owned atms as discussed previously 
we recorded a million write down of certain atm hardware assets for the year ended december   as previously discussed 
operating profit loss the total processing services segment posted an operating profit of million for as compared to operating losses of million and million for and  respectively  as a result of the factors discussed above 
the central european sub segment recorded an operating profit of million for compared to operating losses of million and million for and  respectively  as a result of the factors discussed above 
the western european sub segment had an operating profit of million for compared to operating losses of million and million for and  respectively  as a result of the factors discussed above 
the other processing services sub segment incurred an operating loss of million for and  respectively  and an operating loss of million for  as a result of the factors discussed above 
software solutions segment software solutions revenue revenues from the software solutions segment decreased by million or to million before inter segment eliminations for the from million for revenues from this segment increased million or to million for from million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues from to is due to the decrease in sales while being partially offset by increased maintenance fees earned from sales in and prior 
the increase in revenues from to is due to the increased sales generated by an expanded sales force employed in and software revenues are grouped into four broad categories software license fees  professional service fees  maintenance fees and hardware sales 
software license fees are the initial fees that we charged the licensing of our proprietary application software to customers 
professional service fees are charged for customization  installation and consulting services provided to customers 
software maintenance fees are the ongoing fees charged to customers for the maintenance of the software products 
hardware sales revenues are derived from the sale of computer products and are reported net of cost of sales 
the components of software solutions revenue for  and were years ending december  in thousands software license fees    professional service fees    maintenance fees    hardware sales total software revenue    the decrease in software license fees from to reflects a decrease in sales and a change in the mix of contracts signed 
in  we signed an increasing number of contracts that have a larger share of professional services relative to the license fee 
however  decreased overall sales in offset some of the mix related change decreased above 
overall  revenue decreased slightly reflecting the decrease in sales although the recurring revenue stream represented by maintenance fees increased 
we intend to secure long term revenue streams through multi year maintenance agreements with existing and new customers 
we believe that the revenues of the software solutions segment will increasingly be derived from our new set of software solutions  including our wireless banking solutions 
the increases in software license fees from to were primarily attributable to an increased number of software sales contracts signed in as compared to  primarily in the first half of professional service fees are generally realized in connection with the sale and installation of software  although increasingly professional service fees are being derived from contracts that do not necessarily have a software license component 
software sales backlog we define software sales backlog as fees specified in contracts which have been executed by us and for which we expect recognition of the related revenue within one year 
at december  the revenue backlog was million  as compared to december  when the revenue backlog was million and at december  when the revenue backlog was million 
the decrease in backlog from december  results principally from the timing of software sales 
we intend to continue to focus on expediting delivery and implementing of software in an effort to deliver existing backlogged sales  while simultaneously replenishing the backlog through continuing product sales growth 
the increase in backlog from december  as compared to resulted principally from growth and timing of software sales 
there can be no assurance that the contracts included in backlog will actually generate the specified revenues or that the revenues will be generated within a one year period 
operating expenses software solutions segment operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  selling  general and administrative  and depreciation and amortization 
in  we recorded a one time write down of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets associated with our purchase of euronet usa in december as a result of our inability to achieve operating improvements  including software license and service orders for euronet usa s traditional core product itm and cost reductions  the software solutions segment continued operating at a loss through we calculated the expected cash flows of our software solutions segment  which identified an impairment of its long lived assets 
accordingly  in  we recorded an impairment charge based on the present value of expected cash flows of million for the write down of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets recorded upon the acquisition of euronet usa see note to consolidated financial statements asset write down 
total segment operating expenses decreased by million or to million for from million for such expenses increased by million or to million for from million for the decrease from to is primarily the result of the million one time write down during discussed above  a reduction in staffing in the first quarter of  and general cost reduction efforts in our general operations 
the increase from to is primarily the result of the million one time write down during discussed above  and headcount increases intended to increase sales  accelerate development of certain software enhancements and reduce delivery times for software 
the components of the software solutions segment operating costs for  and were year ending december  in thousands direct operating costs  salaries and benefits    selling  general and administrative    depreciation and amortization   asset write down  total operating expenses    these staff increases during and resulted in a significant increase in salaries and benefits  which contributed to the net losses of the software solutions segment for during the first quarter of we reduced our workforce significantly with the primary objective of reducing costs in the software solutions segment to bring the costs more in line with the anticipated revenue 
the financial impact of these reductions can be seen throughout the results for we have made an ongoing commitment to the development  maintenance and enhancement of our products and services 
as a result of this commitment we have invested substantial amounts in research and development 
in particular  we have invested and will continue to invest in new software products that will serve as the underlying application software that permits additional features and transactions on our atm network 
in addition  we continue to invest in the on going development of products that were recently introduced to the market 
our research and development costs incurred for computer products to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed decreased million or to million for from million for such costs increased million or to million for from million for of these total figures  million  million and million were capitalized  during the years ended december   and respectively  in accordance with our accounting policy requiring the capitalization of development costs on a product by product basis once technological feasibility is established 
technological feasibility of computer software products is established when we have completed all planning  designing  coding  and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
operating loss the software solutions segment incurred an operating loss of million for  million for and million for  as a result of the factors discussed above 
corporate services segment operating expenses operating expenses for the corporate services segment decreased by million or to million for from million for such costs increased by million or to million for from million for the components of the corporate services segment operating costs for  and were year ending december  in thousands salaries and benefits    selling  general and administrative    depreciation and amortization total direct operating expenses    the cost control measures that were implemented in are the primary reasons for these decreased expenditures  including the workforce reductions during the first quarter of in due to the expansion in the company s network infrastructure there was an increase in corporate and administrative capabilities 
in january we began to reclassify certain salary and benefits expense to the processing services other sub segment to better reflect the actual job responsibilities performed 
non operating results interest income interest income decreased to million for from million for and from million for the decreases are the result of lower average cash balances during interest expense interest expense decreased to million for from million for and million for the decrease from to was due to a reduction in the notes payable as a result of significant debt equity swaps during and exchange rate differences as the majority of the debt is denominated in euro 
the decrease from to was due to exchange rate differences as the majority of the debt is denominated in euro 
foreign exchange gain loss we had a net foreign exchange gain of million for  as compared to exchange losses of million for and million for exchange gains and losses that result from re measurement of certain assets and liabilities are recorded in determining net income or loss 
a portion of our assets and liabilities are denominated in euros  including capital lease obligations  notes payable including the notes issued in our public bond offering  cash and cash equivalents  investments  and forward foreign exchange contracts 
it is our policy to attempt to match local currency receivables and payables 
the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities give rise to foreign exchange gains and losses as a result of us dollar to local currency exchange movements 
extraordinary gain during  in sixteen separate transactions  we exchanged  units principal amount of dem million of our senior discount notes and  warrants for  shares of common stock 
these exchanges were accounted for as an extinguishment of debt with a resulting million net of applicable income tax expense of million recognized as an extraordinary gain on such extinguishment 
the extinguishment gain pre tax represents the difference between the allocated carrying value of the debt and any related warrants extinguished million and the fair market value of the common stock issued million  offset by the write off of the allocated unamortized deferred financing costs million 
these transactions were exempt from registration in accordance with section a of the securities act 
during  in a single transaction  we exchanged  principal face amount of dem million of our senior discount notes for two new senior discount notes having an aggregate face amount of million the new notes 
the interest  repayment and other terms of the new notes are identical to those of the senior discount notes for which they were exchanged  except that i the principal amount was reduced as indicated in the previous sentence  ii we have the right to prepay the new notes at any time at our option by paying the accreted value of the notes  and iii the new notes are governed by a new note purchase agreement rather than the indenture under which the senior discount notes were issued and the new notes therefore are not covered by any of the provisions of such indenture relating to action by the trustee  voting or maintenance of listing on a stock exchange 
this exchange has been accounted for as an extinguishment of debt and issuance of new debt with a resulting million net of applicable income tax expense of million recognized as an extraordinary gain on such extinguishment 
the extinguishment gain pre tax represents the difference between the allocated carrying value of the debt extinguished million and the fair market value of the new notes issued million  offset by the write off of the allocated unamortized deferred financing costs million 
this transaction was exempt from registration in accordance with section a of the securities act

the extinguishment gain pre tax represents the difference between the allocated carrying value of the debt and any related warrants extinguished million and the fair market value of the common stock issued million 
these transactions were exempt from registration in accordance with section a of the securities act 
during  we repurchased notes with a face value of dm million and  warrants for a total purchase price of million 
this repurchase was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt with a resulting million net of income taxes of million recognized as an extraordinary gain on such extinguishment 
the extinguishment gain represents the difference between the allocated carrying value of the debt extinguished million and the consideration paid million  offset by the write off of the allocated unamortized deferred financing costs million 
of the total purchase price of million  million was allocated to the warrants based on their fair market value at the time of purchase and recorded as an adjustment to additional paid in capital 
the senior discount notes that were acquired by us in the above exchanges have not been retired 
we will consider additional repurchases of our senior discount notes if opportunities arise to complete such transactions on favorable terms 
net income loss we recorded net income of million for  as compared to a million net loss for and a million net loss for  as a result of the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources up to we had sustained negative cash flows from operations and had financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through the proceeds from the issue of deutsche mark denominated notes payable  the public equity offering  equipment lease financing and private placements of equity securities 
the net proceeds of such transactions  together with revenues from operations and interest income have been used to fund aggregate net losses of approximately million  investments in property  plant and equipment of approximately million and acquisitions of million 
at december  we had cash and cash equivalents of million included in working capital of million 
we had million of restricted cash held as security with respect to cash provided by banks participating in our atm network  to cover guarantees on financial instruments and as deposits with customs officials see note to the consolidated financial statements restricted cash 
in addition to the assets shown on the balance sheet at december  we held repurchased notes payable with a face value of million deutsche marks million as at december  based on a usd to dm rate of and a fair market value at december  of million see note to the consolidated financial statements financial instruments 
on june  we entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement the credit agreement  which provided a facility of up to million from three shareholders as follows dst systems  inc in the amount of million  hungarian american enterprise fund in the amount of million  and michael j 
brown  the ceo and a director of the company  in the amount of million 
the facility was originally available to be drawn upon until december   and repayment of any draws was due june  the credit agreement was amended and renewed for six month periods on december  and june  and  as a result of such amendments  any amounts drawn on the facility must now be repaid by june  a commitment fee was paid for an initial facility of  warrants issued pro rata to the lenders with a warrant strike price set at the average share price  as quoted on nasdaq for trading days prior to the warrant issue date  less percent 
an additional   and  warrants  on the same terms  were issued on january   on june   and on november  for the subsequent extensions of the facility 
warrants were issuable on similar terms and conditions for each draw on the facility at the rate of  warrants for each million of funds drawn 
as of december   we have drawn million and issued  warrants with respect to such draw 
amounts outstanding under the facility accrue interest at percent per annum  payable quarterly 
repayment of the principal is due on june  and we expect to make this repayment on or before this date 
the credit agreement was not renewed in december in  two participants in the revolving credit agreement  in three separate transactions  elected to exercise a total of  warrants for an equal number of shares 
the total amount of cash received from these transactions was million 
we lease many of our atms under capital lease agreements that expire between and and bear interest at rates between and 
as of december  we owed million under such capital lease arrangements see note to the consolidated financial statements leases 
we expect that our capital requirements will continue in the future  although strategies that promote outsourcing and redeployment of underperforming atms will reduce some of these requirements 
acquisitions of related atm businesses and investments in new markets will require additional capital expenditures 
fixed asset purchases for  subject to our evaluation of acceptable returns on new atm investment particularly in the united kingdom  are currently estimated to be in the range of to million 
effective july   we implemented our employee stock purchase plan espp  under which employees have the opportunity to purchase common stock through payroll deductions according to specific eligibility and participation requirements 
the espp was implemented by a series of offerings of three months duration with new offerings commencing on january  april  july  and october of each year 
the option price of common stock purchased under the espp is the lesser of of the fair market value as defined in the espp of the shares on the first day of each offering or the last date of each offering 
under the provisions of the espp  we have reserved  shares of common stock of which  shares had been issued as of december  we intend to qualify the plan as an employee stock purchase plan under section of the internal revenue code of see note to the consolidated financial statement stock plans 
in  matching contributions of  shares of stock were made in conjunction with our k employee benefits plan for year under the terms of such plan  employer match contributions consist of two parts  referred to as basic and discretionary 
the basic matching contribution is equal to of eligible employee elective salary deferrals between and of participating employee salaries for the plan year 
the discretionary matching contribution is determined by the board for a plan year and is allocated in proportion to employee elective deferrals 
for  employer match contributions basic match consisted of  shares and an equal number   shares  were issued under the discretionary matching contribution 
employer matching under the plan for year is expected to be determined in the first quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements employee benefit plans 
we reduced the aggregate amount of our senior discount notes payable from million at december   to million at december  through a series of debt for debt and debt for equity exchanges as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
due to market and other factors  we may not be able to continue to successfully implement such exchanges in and beyond 
we are required to commence cash payments of interest on senior discount notes on january  at current debt levels  we will be required to make approximately million in interest payments on a semi annual basis beginning january  the remaining principal balance of senior discount notes of approximately million after accretion during will be due and payable on january  we have no significant off balance sheet items see note to the consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies 
based on our current business plan and financial projections  we expect to continue to improve operating income and generate net cash inflows from our operating activities in in the processing services segment  we anticipate that increased transaction levels in our atm network will result in additional revenues without a corresponding increase in expenses 
in addition  we expect to further expand our atm outsourcing services and offer new value added services  which will provide continued revenue growth without significantly increasing direct operating expenses or capital investments 
in the software solutions segment  we believe our operating costs are now more in line with anticipated revenues 
we believe that the credit facility  certain asset sales  and cash and cash equivalents will provide us with sufficient capital 
as a result  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity resources to meet current and future cash requirements 
we will continue our policy of assessing opportunities for additional debt and equity financing as they arise  and will pursue any such opportunities if we consider that such opportunities can contribute to fulfilling our financial and strategic business objectives particularly if attractive acquisition opportunities present themselves

we received aggregate proceeds of approximately million from the private placement see note to the consolidated financial statements subsequent events 
balance sheet items cash and cash equivalents the increase of cash and cash equivalents to million at december  from million at december  is due primarily to the net effects of working capital movements  foreign exchange gains and losses  capital expenditures and capital lease payments  and operating income for the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements reconciliation of net income loss to net cash provided by used in operating activities  and the consolidated statements of cash flows

impact of new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted sfas and in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after june  statement will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement statement will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we are required to adopt the provisions of statement immediately  and statement effective january  furthermore  any goodwill and any intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life that are acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june  will not be amortized  but will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre statement accounting literature 
statement will require upon adoption of statement that we evaluate our existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior purchase business combination  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in statement for recognition apart from goodwill 
upon adoption of statement  we will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  we will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of statement within the first interim period 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  statement will require us to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  we must identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
we will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with statement to its carrying amount both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of earnings 
and finally  any unamortized negative goodwill existing at the date statement is adopted must be written off as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
as of the date of adoption  we expect to have unamortized goodwill in the amount of million  which will be subject to the transition provisions of statements and because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting statements and  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these statements on our financial statements at the date of this report  including whether any transitional impairment losses will be required to be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
sfas statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and for the associated asset retirement costs 
the financial accounting standards board fasb began this project in to address the accounting for the costs of nuclear decommissioning 
the fasb subsequently expanded the scope of the project to include closure or removal type costs in other industries 
as a result  statement no 
applies to all entities 
sfas no 
requires an enterprise to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the assets 
the enterprise also is to record a corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the related long lived asset ie  the associated asset retirement costs and to depreciate that cost over the life of the asset 
the liability is changed at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time ie  accretion expense and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the initial fair value measurement 
because of the extensive use of estimates  most enterprises will record a gain or loss when they settle the obligation 
enterprises are required to adopt statement no 
for fiscal years beginning after june  we have not evaluated the impact on the consolidated financial statements of adopting this standard 
sfas sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that statement 
sfas no 
also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the statement is to be applied prospectively 
we have not yet determined the impact  if any  the adoption of this standard will have on our financial position or results of operations 
forward looking statements this document contains statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the us securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this document  including  without limitation  statements regarding i our business plans and financing plans and requirements  ii trends affecting our business plans and financing plans and requirements  iii trends affecting our business  iv the adequacy of capital to meet our capital requirements and expansion plans  v the assumptions underlying our business plans  vi business strategy  vii government regulatory action  viii technological advances and ix projected costs and revenues  are forward looking statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
forward looking statements are typically identified by the words believe  expect  anticipated  intend  estimate and similar expressions 
investors are cautioned that any such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may materially differ from those in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including technological and business developments in the local card  electronic and mobile banking and mobile phone markets affecting the transaction and other fees which we are able to charge for our services  foreign exchange fluctuations  competition from bank owned atm networks  outsource providers of atm services  software providers and providers of outsourced mobile phone services  our relationships with our major customers  sponsor banks in various markets and international card organizations  and changes in laws and regulations affecting our business 
these risks  and other risks are described elsewhere in this document and our periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk operational risk  security our business involves the operation and maintenance of a sophisticated computer network and telecommunications connections with banks  financial institutions and mobile operators 
this  in turn  requires the maintenance of computer equipment and infrastructure  including telecommunications and electrical systems  and the integration and enhancement of complex software applications 
there are certain operational risks inherent in this type of business which can require temporary shut down of parts or all of our processing systems  including failure of electrical supply  failure of computer hardware and software errors 
all of our atms other than our atms in germany are operated through our processing center in budapest so any operational problem there may have a significant adverse impact on the operation of our network generally 
we have experienced operations and computer development staff and have created redundancies and procedures  particularly in our budapest processing center  to mitigate such risks  but they cannot be eliminated entirely 
any technical failure that prevents operation of our systems for a significant period of time will prevent us from processing transactions during that period of time and will directly and adversely affect our revenues and financial results 
our atm network systems process electronic financial transactions using information read by atms or pos terminals from bank debit and credit cards or input into our systems by our customers in the registration process for mobile phone recharge services 
we capture  transmit  handle and store this sensitive bank card information in performing services for our customers 
in addition  our software is designed to permit the operation by our customers of electronic financial transaction networks similar to our network  so our software is used in handling such information 
these businesses involve certain inherent security risks and in particular the risk of electronic interception and theft of the information for use in fraudulent card transactions 
we have incorporated industry standard encryption technology and processing methodology into our systems and software to maintain high levels of security 
although this technology and methodology mitigates security risks  they cannot be eliminated entirely as criminal elements apply increasingly sophisticated technology to attempt to obtain unauthorized access to the information handled by atm and electronic financial transaction networks 
any breach in our security systems could result in the perpetration of fraudulent financial transactions for which we may be found liable 
we are insured against various risks  including theft and negligence  but such insurance is subject to deductibles  exclusions and limitations that may leave us bearing some or all of any losses arising from security breaches 
in addition to electronic fraud issues  theft and vandalism of atms presents risks for our atm business 
we install atms at sites that are high foot traffic sites and are exposed to theft and vandalism 
vandalism during the year increased in some of our markets  particularly in hungary where a series of incidents were attributed to an organized gang that we believe has been apprehended 
although we are insured against such risks  deductibles  exclusions or limitations in such insurance may leave us bearing some or all of any losses arising from theft or vandalism of atms 
in addition  we have experienced increases in claims under our insurance  which has increased our insurance premiums 
foreign exchange exposure in  of our total revenues were generated in poland and hungary  as compared to in and in the primary cause of this upward trend is continued revenue growth in our polish operations during in hungary  the majority of revenues received are denominated in hungarian forints while in poland  the majority of revenues are denominated in polish zlotys 
however  most of our foreign currency denominated contracts are linked to either inflation or the retail price index 
while a significant portion of our expenditures continue to be denominated in us dollars  we are working to create higher matching levels between revenues and expenses denominated in local currencies in order to take advantage of the natural currency hedging this would provide 
we estimate that a further depreciation in foreign exchange rates of the euro  hungarian forint  polish zloty and the british pound sterling against the us dollar  would have the combined effect of a million decrease in our reported net income 
this was estimated using of our net losses after adjusting for unusual impairment and other items including us dollar denominated or indexed expenses 
we acknowledge that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations in that it does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or our financing or operating strategies 
as a result of the introduction of the euro on january   and continued european economic convergence  including the increased influence of the euro  as opposed to the us dollar  on the central european currencies  we expect that the currencies of the markets where we invest will fluctuate less against the euro than against the us dollar 
accordingly  we believe that our euro denominated debt provides  in the medium to long term  a closer matching of assets and liabilities than would us dollar denominated debt 
inflation and functional currencies in recent years  hungary  poland and the czech republic have experienced high levels of inflation 
consequently  these countries currencies have continued to decline in value against the major currencies of the oecd over this time period 
however  due to the significant reduction in the inflation rate of these countries in recent years  none of these countries are considered to have a hyper inflationary economy 
further  the majority of all three subsidiaries revenues are denominated in the local currency 
thus all three subsidiaries use their local currency as the functional currency 
the czech subsidiary changed their functional currency to the respective local currency as of january   and the hungarian subsidiary changed as of july  germany  france and the united kingdom have experienced relatively low and stable inflation rates in recent years 
therefore  the local currency in each of these markets is the functional currency 
although croatia  like germany and france  has maintained relatively stable inflation and exchange rates  the functional currency of the croatian company is the us dollar due to the significant level of us dollar denominated revenues and expenses 
due to the factors mentioned above  we do not believe that inflation will have a significant effect on results of operations or financial condition 
we continually review inflation and the functional currency in each of the countries in which we operate 
interest rate risk the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of our notes payable at december  was million compared to a carrying value of million 
a increase from prevailing interest rates at december  would result in a decrease in fair value of notes payable by approximately million 
fair values were determined from quoted market prices and from investment bankers considering credit ratings and the remaining term to maturity see note to the consolidated financial statements financial instruments 
first interest repayment beginning in interest payments of approximately eur million million on our outstanding bond issue will be payable semi annually on january and july  with the final interest payment due on july  because the bond interest is payable in euros  foreign currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the euro could result in gains or losses which  in turn  could increase or decrease the amount of us dollar equivalent interest paid on a gaap basis 
we currently anticipate making these interest payments from earnings denominated in local currencies in our european markets 
as a result  it may not be necessary to hedge these expected cash payments in us dollars  since the source of funds used for payments would already be in euro or euro linked denominations 
throughout  we will actively monitor our potential need to hedge future bond interest payments  and if required  we will initiate hedging strategies to minimize foreign currency losses resulting from payments made in us dollars
