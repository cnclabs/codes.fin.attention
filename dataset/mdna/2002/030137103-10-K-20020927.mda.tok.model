item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information set forth following item of this report 
net sales for fiscal year has been restated to reflect the adoption of eitf as discussed in item see also cautionary statements regarding forward looking statements in part i of this report 
the registrant s financial results have varied widely over the past three fiscal years 
fiscal year began with a rapid increase in revenues  primarily as a result of the explosive growth in markets that the registrant serves  such as the wireless infrastructure and fiber optics markets 
the registrant undertook a rapid and substantial capacity expansion program in an attempt to keep up with market demand 
as customers in these markets purchased more and more product from the electronic components industry  strong demand from other market sectors followed as customers in these sectors reacted in order to reserve capacity for their needs 
this continued through the first half of fiscal year in the second half of fiscal year  demand from the wireless infrastructure and fiber optics markets plummeted 
the registrant and its competitors experienced not only a decline in order intake  but also a significant increase in order cancellations 
as capacity became available  customers in other industries no longer needed to place orders months into the future  and drastically cut back their orders  setting off a massive inventory correction across virtually all of the industries the registrant serves 
by the end of fiscal year  the registrant began cost control measures to compensate for the resultant downturn 
during the second half of fiscal year  the registrant was able to maintain a relatively high level of sales due to a strong backlog of orders 
however  its book to bill ratio the ratio of net order bookings divided by net sales was below and  as a result  over time  the backlog declined 
the industry s inventory correction continued through fiscal year price competition increased as all companies in the electronics components industry had increased capacity in a now much smaller market 
as a result  the registrant took further steps to control costs during fiscal year results of operations fiscal year compared with fiscal year net sales for the fiscal year ended june  were  a decrease of from the  recorded in the fiscal year ended june  domestic sales decreased by to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year international sales decreased by to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year the decrease in total net sales resulted primarily from a decrease in demand for the registrant s products in both foreign and domestic markets across virtually all product lines 
following the dramatic decrease in orders in the second half of fiscal year  orders remained low throughout fiscal year although the rate of cancellations has returned to historical levels  the registrant has not experienced any significant increase in order levels 
total bookings in fiscal year were  compared to  in fiscal year  representing a decline of approximately 
orders from customers in the wireless infrastructure  fiber optic and semiconductor manufacturing equipment markets remain significantly below the levels obtained in the first half of fiscal year these customers are heavily dependent on activity in the telecommunications industry which remains depressed 
accordingly  it is unclear when orders may be expected to increase 
the registrant has responded to the decrease in business levels by instituting a series of cost reduction initiatives 
during fiscal year  the registrant implemented a series of workforce reductions  scaled back its research and development efforts and significantly reduced capital spending 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the registrant sold a large portion of its palladium raw material inventory a precious metal used in the manufacture of certain core products that it deemed to be excess based on anticipated business levels for million 
the registrant recognized a loss of  after tax  or 
per share  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result of this transaction 
the registrant expects sales to continue at lower levels in future quarters until bookings increase 
the registrant currently expects that bookings will gradually increase over the next few quarters  but will remain at significantly lower levels in fiscal year compared to the peak levels in the first half of fiscal year the increases are anticipated to be in part from an increase in orders for existing products  and in part due to sales of new product offerings which the registrant expects to introduce in the coming quarters 
gross margins were of net sales in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year the decrease in gross margins was primarily attributable to lower sales in relation to fixed costs  the loss on the sale of palladium  inventory write downs to net realizable value as a result of excess quantities  customer requirements and other causes  and a reduction of benefits from reclaiming activity  offset partially by the net effect of the workforce reductions and other cost controls discussed above 
operating expenses totaled  or of net sales  in fiscal year  compared to  or of net sales  in fiscal year the decrease in operating expenses from the prior fiscal year was attributable to decreased staff as a result of the cost reduction measures discussed above  lower commissions related to the lower sales volume  lower bonus accruals due to decreased profitability  and decreased research and development spending  partially offset by severance costs and other restructuring costs of approximately  as a percentage of sales  operating expenses increased due to the lower level of sales and the fixed nature of certain expenses 
net interest expense was  in fiscal year  compared to net interest expense of  in fiscal year the increase in net interest expense was attributable to decreased interest income due to lower prevailing interest rates  offset partially by an increase in cash available for investing and lower interest expense on loans 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal year was  as compared to for fiscal year the increase in the effective income tax rate was due to operating losses and the impact of certain credits 
as a result of the foregoing  the registrant reported a net loss of  or 
per common share 
per common share assuming dilution  for fiscal year  compared to net income of  or per common share per common share assuming dilution  for fiscal year fiscal year compared with fiscal year net sales for the fiscal year ended june  were  an increase of from the  recorded in the fiscal year ended june  domestic sales increased by to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year international sales increased by to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year the increase in total net sales resulted primarily from an increase in demand for the registrant s core capacitor products in both foreign and domestic markets  primarily in the first six months of fiscal year during the first half of fiscal year  the significant increase in customer orders which began during fiscal year continued 
this increase was evident in all market sectors  but was most pronounced in the wireless infrastructure  fiber optic and semiconductor manufacturing equipment sectors 
in the second half of fiscal year  customer orders declined significantly due to slowdowns in these markets 
as a result  total bookings in fiscal year were  compared to record bookings in fiscal year of  a decline of approximately 
during the first half of the fiscal year ended june   many of the registrant s customers changed their ordering patterns to protect themselves against potential supply shortages 
these customers reverted back to prior practices of placing long term orders to lock in supplier commitments in recent years  customer ordering patterns have trended toward smaller volume orders with shorter lead times 
this trend changed abruptly in the latter half of the fiscal year  primarily as a result of the slowdown in the wireless infrastructure  fiber optic and semiconductor manufacturing equipment sectors 
the registrant experienced order cancellations and decreased bookings from its customers in these industries as they attempted to rationalize their inventory levels to the demand for their products 
gross margins were of net sales in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year the decrease in gross margins was primarily attributable to higher costs for palladium  costs associated with initial production of several new product initiatives and inventory write downs to net realizable value as a result of the economic slowdown during the second half of fiscal year  and to a lesser extent  certain non recurring charges primarily related to the retirement of certain equipment 
operating expenses totaled  or of net sales  in fiscal year  compared to  or of net sales  in fiscal year the increase in operating expenses from the prior fiscal year was primarily attributable to increased staff to support the higher volume of transactions  higher commissions related to the higher sales volume  and increased research and development spending for the development of new products 
net interest expense was  in fiscal year  compared to net interest expense of  in fiscal year the increase in net interest expense was attributable to increases in loan balances during fiscal year in support of capital expansion as compared to fiscal year  and a decrease in interest income on cash and investments due to lower cash available for investing 
the effective income tax rate for both fiscal year and fiscal year was 
as a result of the foregoing  the registrant reported net income of  or per common share per common share assuming dilution  for fiscal year  compared to net income of  or per common share per common share assuming dilution  for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources the registrant s financial position at june  remains strong as evidenced by working capital of  compared to working capital of  at june  the registrant s current ratio at june  was  compared to at june  the registrant s quick ratio at june  increased to  compared to at june  cash and investments increased to  at june   compared to  at june  the increase in cash and investments was primarily the result of the sale of excess palladium described above  lower capital expenditures and collections of accounts receivable 
accounts receivable decreased by  to  at june   compared to  at june  the decrease in accounts receivable was attributable to lower sales volume throughout fiscal year inventories decreased by  to  at june   compared to  at june  the decrease is primarily the result of the sale of excess palladium  planned reductions commensurate with lower business levels and the writedown of certain inventory to net realizable value 
the registrant continues to maintain high finished goods inventory levels to keep customer lead times to a minimum and maintain good customer service 
other current assets increased by  primarily due to increased income tax receivables as a result of losses incurred in fiscal current portion of long term debt increased  to  at june  compared to  at june  the increase in the current portion of long term debt is due to bank debt becoming due as the result of covenant violations as discussed below 
accounts payable decreased by  to  at june   compared to  at june  the decrease in accounts payable was the result of reduced spending for capital expenditures and raw material due to the economic slowdown 
accrued expenses decreased by  to  at june   compared to  at june  the decrease in accrued expenses was due to lower commissions and bonuses payable due to declining sales and income 
the registrant has an income tax receivable of  at june   compared to a payable of  at june   due to losses incurred in fiscal year the registrant leases its facility in jacksonville  florida from a partnership controlled by the registrant s president  chief executive officer and principal stockholder under a capital lease 
the rental payments under this lease have been adjusted several times  most recently as of september  primarily to reflect certain additions to the facility and market value adjustments as required by the terms of the lease based upon independent appraisals 
see item properties 
effective september   the registrant is obligated to pay approximately  per annum under this lease  an increase from  per annum during fiscal year the payments due over the remaining nine years of this capital lease  including the portion related to interest  total approximately  see item certain relationships and related transactions and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at june   the registrant had available two credit facilities with bank of america  na bank of america a  revolving line of credit against which no borrowings were incurred  and an  equipment line of credit against which the registrant had borrowings of  outstanding 
both lines bore interest at above the one month libor rate or approximately at june  the outstanding principal balance of the equipment line rolled over periodically into a self amortizing term note of not less than four nor more than seven years 
each of these credit facilities was subject to certain financial covenants  including maintenance of asset and liability percentage ratios 
one such covenant required the registrant to maintain a certain level of annualized earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to current debt plus annual interest payments 
as of june   due to the losses incurred by the registrant during fiscal year  the registrant was not in compliance with this covenant 
the registrant held discussions with bank of america concerning possible amendments to the terms of these facilities which proved to be unsuccessful 
accordingly  in july  the registrant repaid the outstanding balance of the equipment facility and terminated both of these facilities 
in may  the registrant entered into an uncommitted credit facility with european american bank eab  which was succeeded by citibank  na citibank 
the facility contemplated a  equipment line of credit and a  unsecured term loan line 
both lines bore interest at the registrant s option at either the citibank prime rate or above the reserve adjusted libor as defined  were subject to certain financial covenants and required approval from citibank prior to any borrowing 
any outstanding balance six months after the term loan line was made available and at expiration of the line was to automatically convert into fully amortizing term loans with a maturity of five years bearing interest at the same rate as the equipment loan 
this facility was scheduled to expire in january but was extended month to month until may  at which time it was not renewed 
the registrant had not incurred any borrowings under this facility 
in august  the registrant secured a  mortgage loan form eab in connection with its purchase of the facility at stepar place  huntington station  new york 
citibank succeeded to this loan as successor to eab 
the loan was to be repaid in equal monthly installments over years and bore interest at above the six month libor rate 
the mortgage was subject to certain financial covenants  including maintenance of asset and liability percentage ratios 
in june  the registrant repaid the remaining balance due under this loan 
the registrant is negotiating the terms of a one year uncommitted credit facility with a major bank 
under the terms being discussed  the registrant may request advances under the facility from time to time up to an aggregate of  the bank would have the right  in its sole discretion  to approve or reject any such advance 
any advance made would bear interest  at the registrant s option  at the bank s prime rate or above libor as defined 
there can be no assurance that these negotiations will result in the registrant obtaining a new credit facility or that  if obtained  the bank will approve any request by the registrant for an advance thereunder 
the registrant believes that cash on hand  investments and cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to fund its ongoing cash requirements  in the event we are unable to negotiate a new facility 
capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended june  totaled  including expenditures for machinery and equipment and planned leasehold improvements 
the registrant intends to use cash on hand  cash generated through operations  and available credit  if any  to finance budgeted capital expenditures  primarily for equipment acquisition  of approximately  in fiscal year aggregate contractual obligations as of june  mature as follows payments due by period in s less than after contractual obligations total year years years years bank debt   capital lease obligations  operating leases total contractual obligations   as described above  in july  the registrant repaid the outstanding balance of its equipment line from bank of america 
accordingly  the registrant currently has no outstanding long term debt  or available committed lines of credit 
the registrant routinely enters into binding and non binding purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business  primarily covering anticipated purchases of inventory and equipment 
the terms of these commitments generally do not extend beyond six months 
none of these obligations are individually significant 
the registrant does not expect that these commitments will materially adversely affect its liquidity in the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the registrant s significant accounting policies are described in note to its consolidated financial statements contained in item financial statements and supplementary data of this report 
the registrant believes that the following accounting policies require the application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments allowances for doubtful accounts receivable the registrant performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and a customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by its review of the customer s current credit information 
the registrant continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon its historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that the registrant has identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within the registrant s expectations and the allowances established  the registrant cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that it has in the past 
should the financial position of its customers deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay amounts due  the registrant s revised estimate of such losses and any actual losses in excess of previous estimates may negatively impact its operating results 
sales returns and allowances in the ordinary course of business  the registrant accepts returns of products sold for various reasons and grants sales allowances to customers 
while the registrant engages in extensive product quality control programs and processes  its level of sales returns is affected by  among other things  the quality of its manufacturing process 
the registrant maintains an allowance for sales returns and allowances based upon historical returns and allowances granted 
while such returns and allowances have historically been within the registrant s expectations  actual return and allowance rates in the future may differ from current estimates  which could negatively impact its operating results 
inventory valuation the registrant values inventory at the lower of aggregate cost first in  first out or market 
when the cost of inventory is determined by management to be in excess of its market value such inventory  is written down to its estimated net realizable value 
this requires the registrant to make estimates and assumptions about several factors eg  future sales quantities and selling prices  and percentage complete and failure rates for work in process based upon historical experience and its projections for future periods 
changes in factors such as the level of order bookings  the product mix of order bookings and the registrant s manufacturing processes could have a material impact on the registrant s assessment of the net realizable value of inventory in the future 
valuation of deferred tax assets the registrant regularly evaluates its ability to recover the reported amount of its deferred income taxes considering several factors  including its estimate of the likelihood of the registrant generating sufficient taxable income in future years during the period over which temporary differences reverse 
presently  the registrant believes that it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets based primarily on its history of and projections for taxable income in the future  and its intention to carry back net operating losses to generate refunds of income taxes previously paid 
in the event that actual results differ from its estimates or the registrant adjusts these estimates in future periods  the registrant may need to establish a valuation allowance against a portion or all of its deferred tax assets  which could materially impact its financial position or results of operations in future periods 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets the registrant assesses the recoverability of long lived assets whenever the registrant determines that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
its assessment is primarily based upon its estimate of future cash flows associated with these assets 
the registrant believes that the carrying amount of its long lived assets is recoverable 
however  should its operating results continue to deteriorate  or anticipated new product launches not occur or not attain the commercial acceptance that the registrant anticipates  the registrant may determine that some portion of its long lived assets are impaired 
such determination could result in non cash charges to income that could materially affect its financial position or results of operations for that period 
inflation the registrant does not expect the effects of inflation to have a significant impact on its liquidity or results of operations 
accounting standards issued but not yet adopted in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

sfas no 
addresses financial accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with retirement of tangible long lived assets and for the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas no 
requires a company to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it incurred a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that results from the acquisition  construction development and or normal use of the asset 
the company is also to record a corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the related asset and to depreciate that cost over the life of the asset 
the amount of the liability is changed at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in estimated future cash flows 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the registrant adopted sfas no 
 effective july  such adoption had no impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 which supercedes statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 

although it retains the basic requirements of sfas no 
regarding when and how to measure an impairment loss  sfas no 
provides additional implementation guidance 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the registrant adopted sfas no 
 effective july  such adoption had no impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 
 which is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  sfas no 
applies to costs associated with an exit activity including restructuring costs or with a disposal of long lived assets 
companies will record exit or disposal costs as incurred and such liabilities will be at fair value 
the registrant does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial position 
market risks the registrant has identified four market risks relative to its business interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk and security price risk 
the registrant has managed its market risk exposures in order to minimize their potential impact on its consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
specifically a interest rate risk 
in light of the registrant s existing cash balances  and that the registrant s bank debt was paid in full shortly after the end of the fiscal year  it does not believe that a significant change in interest rates would have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
b foreign currency exchange rate risk 
with the exception of sales by the registrant s wholly owned subsidiary  in sweden which are denominated in krona  all transactions are  or are anticipated to be  denominated in us dollars 
at the present time  the contribution of this subsidiary to the registrant s consolidated results of operations is not significant 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  fluctuations in exchange rates would not presently have a material adverse effect on the registrant s operations 
c commodity price risk 
following substantial reductions in the price of palladium  prices for this precious metal  which is used in the manufacture of the registrant s capacitors  have stabilized 
accordingly  the registrant has sold a majority of its stock of this raw material 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the registrant believes that  based upon its current levels of production and inventories of palladium  it will need to buy additional quantities of palladium later in the next fiscal year at prevailing market prices 
additionally  the registrant believes that the price of palladium will remain stable due to the lower demand coming from the electronics industry 
d security price risk 
the registrant s current portfolio of marketable securities consists of us treasury notes with varying maturities of up to ten years 
the registrant believes it can effectively manage any exposure resulting from declining prices by holding any securities which decline substantially in value until maturity
