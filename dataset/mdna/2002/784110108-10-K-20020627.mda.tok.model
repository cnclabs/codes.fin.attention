in fiscal  we introduced seec mosaic studio 
our customer base consists primarily of large and medium sized organizations including corporations  third party information technology it service providers  higher education institutions  non profit entities and governmental agencies 
we derive our revenues from software license and maintenance fees and professional services fees 
professional services are typically provided to customers in conjunction with the license of software products 
our enterprise solutions and software products and services are marketed through a broad range of distribution channels  including direct sales to end users  and to end users in conjunction with our partners 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we periodically evaluate these estimates  including those related to our revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on the specific circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies impact the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
we follow detailed guidelines discussed in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry 
the accounting rules related to revenue recognition are complex and are affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
consequently  the revenue recognition accounting rules require management to make significant judgments 
revenues are derived from the license of software products  customer support and maintenance contracts  and services contracts  including consulting and training services 
revenues from product license fees are recognized when an order or agreement is in hand  the fee is fixed and determinable  and delivery of the product has occurred 
customer support and maintenance contract revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the related agreement  generally twelve months 
the company provides professional services under time and materials and fixed price contracts 
revenues from time and materials contracts are recognized as the services are provided 
revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized principally by the percentage of completion method  whereby income is recognized based on the estimated stage of completion of individual contracts 
provision for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts is made in the period in which such losses are determinable 
fixed price contracts and related estimates have not been significant in recent years 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
we record intangible assets when we acquire other companies 
the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired  including intangible assets  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
we periodically review the carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets for indications of impairment 
if impairment is indicated  we assess the value of the intangible assets 
the value of goodwill and intangible assets has been amortized to operating expense over time  with in process research and development recorded as a one time charge on the acquisition date 
under current accounting guidelines that became effective on july   goodwill arising from transactions occurring after june  and any existing goodwill as of april  are no longer amortized to expense but rather are periodically assessed for impairment 
as a result of write downs of goodwill resulting from impairment evaluations performed in fiscal and  no goodwill exists as of april  we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our remaining intangible assets 
a reduction in our estimate of remaining useful lives  if any  could result in increased amortization expense in future periods 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the credit worthiness of our customers based on past collection history and specific risks identified in our outstanding accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of a customer deteriorates such that its ability to make payments might be impaired  or if payments from a customer are significantly delayed  additional allowances might be required  resulting in future bad debt expense not provided in the allowance for doubtful accounts at march  results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues represented by certain income and expense items

research and development 
total expenditures for research and development were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the decrease was primarily the result of the elimination of outside consulting costs related to a completed development project

an income tax benefit of  was recorded for fiscal  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
no income tax provision or benefit was recorded for fiscal in fiscal and  we calculated a net deferred tax asset  which was offset by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of realization of our net operating loss carryforwards

we believe that cash flows from operations and the current cash balances will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future

such sources of capital may include additional equity offerings or debt financings 
impact of inflation increases in the inflation rate are not expected to materially affect our operating results 
inflationary cost increases have not been material in recent years  and to the extent allowed in light of competitive pressures  such increases are passed on to customers through increased billing rates 
foreign currency translation the overall effects of foreign currency exchange rates on our business during the periods discussed have not been material 
movements in foreign currency exchange rates create a degree of risk to our operations if those movements affect the dollar value of costs incurred in foreign currencies

sfas no 
must be applied in fiscal years beginning after december  to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized at that date  regardless of when those assets were initially recognized

item a 
market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalent investments 
we have not used derivative financial instruments 
we invest our excess cash in short term  floating rate instruments that carry a degree of interest rate risk 
these instruments may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
conversely  if interest rates rise  the market value of our fixed income investments will likely be negatively impacted 
foreign currency risk 
as of march   we had operating subsidiaries located in the united kingdom and india 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall profitability 
we maintain only nominal foreign currency cash balances  consisting of working funds necessary to facilitate the short term operations of our subsidiaries 
at march  we did not hold any material foreign denominated financial instruments or contracts  and we have not entered into foreign currency hedge transactions 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our financial position or results of operations has not been  and is not expected to be  material in the foreseeable future
