item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our ten television stations are regionally diverse and range in market size based on television households from through in the nation 
all but one of our stations are affiliates of the wb television network 
our second station in the albuquerque santa fe marketplace is a upn affiliate 
kplr st 
louis  our only vhf station  has been broadcasting in that market for over years and is considered a mature television station 
our other nine stations our developing stations have only been on the air  or achieving measurable ratings  for years 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of advertising time to local  regional and national advertisers 
our revenues depend on popular programming that attracts audiences in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  allowing us to sell advertising time at satisfactory rates 
our revenues also depend significantly on factors such as the national and local economy and the level of local competition 
our revenues are generally highest during the fourth quarter of each year  primarily due to increased expenditures by advertisers in anticipation of holiday season consumer spending and an increase in viewership during this period 
we generally pay commissions to advertising agencies on local  regional and national advertising and to national sales representatives on national advertising 
our revenues reflect deductions from gross revenues for commissions payable to advertising agencies and national sales representatives 
our primary ongoing operating expenses are programming costs  employee compensation  advertising and promotion expenditures and depreciation and amortization 
programming expense consists primarily of amortization of broadcast rights relating to syndicated programs as well as news production and sports rights fees 
changes in employee compensation expense result primarily from increases in total staffing levels  from adjustments to fixed salaries based on individual performance and inflation and from changes in sales commissions paid to our sales staff based on levels of advertising revenues 
advertising and promotion expenses consist primarily of media and related production costs resulting from the promotion of our stations and programs 
this amount is net of any reimbursement received or due to us for such advertisement and promotion from the wb network  upn or from other program suppliers 
in the fall of  we began to experience a noticeable slowdown in non political advertiser demand 
by december  it was clear that there was a dramatic weakness in demand affecting all media related companies and there were broader indications that the us economy was in a slowdown 
this slack demand continued through all of  and the resultant effect of the events of september  only made a tough year worse 
by industry account  television revenues declined approximately over  the steepest decline in the last years 
nearly every publicly traded television broadcaster  including the company  posted year over year declines in advertising revenues 
although television advertising revenues have not declined for two consecutive years since the depression of the s  some industry analysts have forecast that advertising revenue will again decline in we remain cautiously optimistic that advertising demand  along with the overall health of the us economy  will rebound in results of operations years ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues for the year ended december  decreased million to million as compared to million for the year ended december  while our revenue grew at our developing stations reflecting gains in market shares that outstripped market revenue declines these increases were more than offset by a decline in revenue at kplr  our station serving the st 
louis marketplace  where market revenue declines were compounded by a slight loss in kplr s market share 
these market share gains and losses track generally with gains and losses in audience shares  while the 
table of contents decreases in market revenues reflect weak demand for advertising experienced throughout the media industry in station operating expenses increased to million compared to the prior year s operating expenses of million 
this increase of was attributable primarily to our continued investment in programming and sales staffing and related costs at our developing stations 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year was million compared to million for this 
million increase primarily reflects the higher depreciation expense related to our ongoing transmission upgrades relating to both our analog and digital facilities that were placed in service during corporate expenses for increased to million from million in corporate expenses increased in over levels due primarily to increased professional fees incurred in connection with potential strategic transactions and increased insurance costs 
equity based compensation of  in and relates to options granted below market value in to senior management in exchange for their participation in the company s previously established long term incentive plan 
interest expense for the current year was million compared to million for this million increase in interest expense is the result of increasing principal balances arising from continued amortization of original issuance discounts on our acme television subsidiary s senior discount notes due the television notes and our acme intermediate subsidiary s senior secured discount notes due the intermediate notes 
the tax benefit for was million  representing an effective tax rate of 
the difference in the statutory federal rate of and the company s effective tax benefit of relates to the impact of non deductible expenses  principally the amortization of goodwill at kplr 
our broadcast cash flow for was million  compared to a million broadcast cash flow in this decrease reflects the adverse impact of lower revenue against higher operating expenses compared to our net loss for the current year was million as compared with the million loss incurred in  an increase of million 
this increase in our net loss is primarily the result of our increased operating loss and increased interest expense 
years ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues for the year ended december  increased to million as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase reflects revenue gains at each station  and to a lesser extent  to the full year impact in of stations acquired or launched during which were on the air for the full year increases in revenue were driven primarily by increased ratings  improved distribution and higher unit prices 
station operating expenses increased to million compared to the prior year s operating expenses of million 
this increase was due primarily to increased programming expenses at many of our developing stations coupled with the full year impact in of stations acquired or launched during depreciation and amortization expense for the year was million compared to million for this million increase reflects the full year amortization of intangible assets and increased depreciation relating to the stations that were newly built or acquired in and ongoing upgrades of existing facilities  and the full year of amortization of the goodwill associated with our purchase of our subsidiary acme intermediate  llc s minority interest upon our ipo in september corporate expenses for decreased to million from million in our expense included a non recurring million charge relating to ipo bonuses paid primarily to the company s senior management founders 
all other corporate expenses increased in over levels due primarily to 
table of contents the increase in costs associated with being a publicly traded company which were offset by a decrease in incentive compensation 
equity based compensation of  in relates to options granted below market value in to senior management in exchange for their participation in the company s previously established long term incentive plan 
the million in relates primarily to a charge reflecting the fully vested common stock issued in connection with the company s initial public offering in september in exchange for the management carry units that were issued in june to our senior founding management members 
interest expense for the current year was million compared to million for this million decrease in interest expense is the result of the elimination in of interest charges related to borrowings on the revolving credit facility and the bridge loan  both of which were repaid with proceeds from the ipo in october  offset by increasing balances under the company s senior notes 
in  the company sold its studio facility in st 
louis which resulted in a gain of million 
we have leased these premises back under a short term lease and expect to move to new facilities by the spring of we also sold our studio building in albuquerque pursuant to a purchase option previously granted and leased those premises back under a long term lease 
the sale of the building in albuquerque resulted in a loss of approximately  the tax benefit for was million  representing an effective tax benefit of 
the difference in the statutory federal rate of and the company s effective tax benefit of relates to the impact of non deductible expenses 
our tax benefit was million  reflecting the tax benefit of our fourth quarter taxable losses incurred subsequent to the september  termination of our non taxable status and also includes the one time impact of that termination 
prior to the reorganization  acme television holdings  llc was a limited liability company  therefore  no income taxes have been provided for its operations other than at its subsidiary acme television of missouri  inc which is a c corporation subject to federal and state taxation 
any liability or benefit from the company s non taxable entities consolidated income or loss is the responsibility of  or benefit to  the individual members 
in conjunction with the reorganization  the company terminated its non taxable status 
in conjunction with this termination  the company recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities at the termination date for the difference between the financial statement carrying amount and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
minority interest represents the allocation of the loss for the respective periods to the minority interest holders of our subsidiary acme intermediate holdings  llc 
effective with the company s september reorganization  the minority interest holders exchanged their membership units of acme intermediate holdings  llc for stock in acme communications  inc accordingly  there was no minority interest recorded for and the amount allocated to minority interests for reflects allocations through september  excluding equity based compensation charges  which were not allocated the minority interest 
our broadcast cash flow for was million  compared to a million broadcast cash flow in this increase is primarily attributable to the increased revenue and margins at most of our stations 
our net loss for the current year was million as compared with the million loss incurred in  a decrease of million 
this decrease in our net loss is primarily the result of the significant reduction in our equity based compensation expense  a reduction of million in interest expense and our increased revenues and operating margins  net of increased depreciation and amortization expenses 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for  an increased use of cash of million 
the increased use was primarily due to the payment of cash interest on the television notes and increased payments for program rights 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the majority of the activity in both years relates to the company s ongoing capital expenditures for the upgrading of its stations  including the build out of digital facitilies 
the expenditures are net of million in proceeds from the sale of the kplr studio facility 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  which represents the net new borrowings in excess of restricted cash used as collateral and repayments under the company s various capital lease facilities 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was million and represents the net new borrowings in excess of repayments under the company s various capital lease facilities 
the company has carried a high debt level since the issuance of its television notes and its intermediate notes in september these notes were issued at an original discount 
the television notes began accruing cash interest on october  and the first semi annual interest payment of million was on march  the intermediate notes will begin accruing cash interest on october  and will have their initial semi annual interest payment of million on march  although we have generated positive annual cash flow from our broadcast operations  before considering interest payments  since our inception in  the weak advertising environment in resulted in our first ever decline in such cash flow 
accordingly  while we had built cash balances through year end  these cash balances began to decline in under the pressure of cash interest expenses and continued capital equipment expenditures 
in late  when we recognized that the slowdown in the demand for advertising was adversely affecting our operating results  we negotiated an amendment to our then current revolving credit facility 
this amendment lowered financial covenants for the quarters ended december  through september  and also revised the amortization of our borrowing availability 
as the advertising slump worsened in  we further amended the financial covenants under the facility through the third quarter of recognizing that we would not be in compliance with the unamended december  financial covenants  we initiated discussions with various asset based lenders to replace our credit facility in late at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility and  as expected  we were not in compliance with all of the facility s financial covenants 
in february  we completed the replacement of our revolving credit facility with foothill capital corporation  as both agent and lender 
the new revolving facility  which like its predecessor is secured by all of our television station assets  allows for borrowings up to million  contains less restrictive financial covenants and expires may  the agent is obligated to use its best efforts to increase the facility to million via the placement of additional syndication  but there is no assurance such a placement will be completed 
under this agreement  we have the option to borrow at an interest rate determined by either a base rate wells fargo bank s prime rate plus percentage points  or at the libor rate plus percentage points 
the financial covenants  which are quarterly tests beginning march   included in the new facility are a minimum ebitda  b maximum total leverage  c minimum cash interest coverage  d minimum net tangible worth and e maximum capital expenditures annual basis only 
in addition to the financial covenants  the facility contains negative covenants which  among other restrictions  require the lender s approval for certain station acquisitions and dispositions 
we are in the process of securing and recording all necessary liens and security interests required by the lender before we can draw against the facility 
we expect those requirements to be satisfied by the end of april the company also has million available under a capital lease facility as of december   contingent on our posting additional collateral of million 
borrowings under the currently available capital lease facility will be repaid over four years 
borrowings under previous capital lease facilities are generally paid over five years 
at december   amounts due under all capital lease facilities was million bearing an implicit average interest rate of per annum 
we expect to incur approximately million in additional capital expenditures in as we conclude our transition to digital broadcasting  as required by the fcc 
after this transition is completed  we expect that our capital expenditures  apart from those related to any pending and future acquisitions  will be average approximately  per station per year 

table of contents at december   the company had million of cash  million of which is restricted to collateralize capital lease obligations  and working capital of million 
the company believes that existing unrestricted cash balances  funds generated from operations and borrowings under its credit facility and capital lease facility  if necessary  will be sufficient to satisfy the company s cash requirements for its existing operations for at least the next twelve months 
the company expects that any future acquisitions and related capital expenditures of television stations  including the madison  wisconsin acquisition and any of the four construction permits  would be financed through these same sources and  if necessary  through additional debt and equity financings 
there is no guarantee that such other means of raising capital will be at terms acceptable to the company  and accordingly current stockholders could be adversely affected by such financings 
certain factors that may effect future results and financial condition the following factors could have a material and adverse impact on the company s business our highly leveraged financial position poses the following risks to stockholders cash flow from operations  before interest payments  will not be sufficient to service our indebtedness in the foreseeable future  our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes  including acquisitions might be impeded  and we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and our ability to withstand competitive pressures is limited 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from advertisers in diverse industries 
if a number of our advertisers continue to reduce their expenditures because of the current or a future general economic downturn  or an economic downturn in one or more industries or regions  or for any other reason  our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
if we do not meet our interest obligations under our indentures or if we otherwise default under these instruments  our debt may be accelerated under these instruments as well as other debt instruments we have 
in addition  because we are highly leveraged  it could limit our ability to respond to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or borrow under our revolving credit facility to meet our obligations and commitments  we will be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness or raise additional debt or equity capital 
additionally  we may be required to sell material assets or operations or delay or forego acquisitions 
these alternative strategies would likely not be effected on satisfactory terms  if at all 
our credit agreement and our subsidiaries indentures contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends  merge  consolidate or sell assets  make acquisitions or investments  or change the nature of our business 
our credit agreement also requires us to maintain certain financial covenants 
at december  we failed to meet certain of our prior credit agreement financial covenants 
although we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the facility  without waivers or amendments to the agreement  we would not have been able to borrow under the agreement 
on february  we entered into a replacement facility with foothill 
table of contents capital corporation 
our revolving credit agreement with foothill capital corporation requires us to obtain certain landlord waivers and consents prior to borrowing under the facility 
we expect to provide them by the end of april the agreement also requires us to maintain certain financial covenants  which we expect to be able to meet in the future 
however  if we fail to secure the required waivers and consents  or fail to meet some or all of the covenants  we may not be able to borrow under the facility which might adversely affect our ability to make acquisitions as planned or meet general or extraordinary capital needs 
if we experience a change of control  either as defined by our credit agreement or either indenture  we might not have sufficient funds to repay all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and repurchase the notes  as may be required 
we have incurred net losses in each of our fiscal years since inception and expect to continue to experience net losses in the foreseeable future 
these net losses are principally a result of interest expense on our outstanding debt and non cash charges for depreciation expense related to fixed assets 
our plans to acquire additional television stations during the past two years have been adversely affected by our increased leverage resulting from a decline in our broadcast cash flow and the related constraints in borrowing under our previous revolving credit facility 
our future growth could be limited if we are unable to successfully execute and implement additional station acquisitions 
furthermore  our ability to acquire additional television stations is affected by the following many competing acquirors have greater resources available to make such acquisitions than we have  desired stations might not be available for purchase  any inability to obtain the wb network affiliation for all of the stations we acquire  our lack of the financial resources necessary to acquire additional stations  failure to obtain fcc approval of the assignments or transfers of control of fcc licenses  and current fcc rules limit the number of television broadcasting properties that any one person or entity  including its affiliates  may own in any given market which could limit our ability to pursue desired stations 
generally when we sign acquisition agreements  we enter into interim local marketing agreements with the seller under which we receive some or all of station revenues and pay proportionate station expenses 
because the seller retains ultimate programming control  we bear the economic risks of paying station expenses until closing the acquisition 
mr 
kellner s consulting agreement provides that he may perform services for other businesses unaffiliated with ours that  in certain limited circumstances  may be competitive 
because of mr 
kellner s experience in the television broadcast industry  if mr 
kellner provides services to a competing business  it could materially affect our operations 
mr 
kellner s position at the wb network could create conflicts with his position with us if our interests differ from those of the wb network 
because mr 
kellner is both our chief executive officer and the wb network s chief executive officer  the wb network requires that he recuse himself from any material transaction between the wb network and us 
additionally  due to his responsibilities with aol time warner s television networks division and the wb network  mr 
kellner continues to have limited time available to devote to us 
if we experience a further significant decline in broadcast cash flow from kplr  we will not have any positive cash flow and will not be able to fulfill our current and future obligations and commitments 
due to negative net cash flow at several of our start up stations  broadcast cash flow from kplr accounted for more than of our total broadcast cash flow in the required conversion of the broadcast industry to provide digitally transmitted television signals is requiring us to make significant capital expenditures that may not be balanced by consumer demand for digital 
table of contents television 
the fcc requires all broadcasters to provide a digitally transmitted signal by may and  generally  to stop using analog signals on the stations by we have filed requests with the fcc for six month extensions for implementing our digital transmissions at all of our stations and such requests have been granted  thereby delaying our implementation date to no later than november as of year end  digital television sets are present in less than of us television households  and accordingly  we are unable to predict the extent of consumer demand for digital television will be or when that demand will arise 
contractual cash obligations our contractual cash obligations  by year of payment  are as follows total interest on programming operating contractual long term long term rights capital lease lease cash debt debt obligations obligations obligations obligations thereafter total in addition to the above contractual obligations  the company expects that its capital expenditures for will be approximately million for our existing stations  which are primarily related to our conversion to digital broadcasting as required by the fcc 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to broadcast rights  bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
programming rights the company s programming rights are stated  on a gross basis  at the lower of amortized cost or estimated realizable value 
the company evaluates estimated realizable value of programming rights based on current usage and revenue performance and projected future revenue and usage of such programs 
changes in the company s programming schedule could impact the estimated realizable value of programming 
in addition  estimates of future revenue performance relate to the number of advertising spots which will be sold by the company and the amount generated from such sales 
a decrease in the number of spots sold or the amount for such sales could also impact the company s estimated realizable value 
during  and  the company recorded write downs of program rights due to impairments of   and  respectively 

table of contents impairment of asset values accounting for intangibles the carrying values of our long lived assets tangible  identifiable intangible and goodwill are reviewed for impairment based upon estimated future cash flows of the stations 
as of december   the company has not recorded any impairment related to long lived assets 
future adverse changes in market conditions  changes in technology and other factors could reduce the expected future cash flows and result in an impairment charge 
revenue recognition the company records revenue from the sale of airtime related to advertising and contracted time at the time of broadcast 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company utilizes information available to the company  including the timing of payments and the financial condition of our customers  to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
it should be noted that the company s does not have a significant concentration of accounts receivable from any single customer or industry segment 
accounting for income taxes the company has recorded a tax benefit for losses primarily based on deferred tax liabilities which will generate future taxable income 
during  the company anticipates that tax benefits recognized by the company will equal deferred tax liabilities 
accordingly  it is likely that the company will record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities as the company believes that it is not more likely than not that such tax benefit will be realized 
this will reduce the tax benefit recorded by the company in calendar and thereafter 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize a deferred tax asset in the future that is in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance and a tax benefit would be recorded
