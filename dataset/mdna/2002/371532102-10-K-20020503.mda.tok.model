in its wholesale operations  cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
market is determined using a system of analysis which evaluates inventory at the stock number level based on factors such as inventory turn  average selling price  inventory level  and selling prices reflected in future orders 
in its retail operations  the company employs the retail inventory method  applying average cost to retail ratios to the retail value of inventories 
under the retail inventory method  valuing inventory at the lower of cost or market is achieved as markdowns are taken or accrued as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the retail inventory method are subjective judgments and estimates including merchandise mark on  markups  markdowns  and shrinkage 
these judgments and estimates  coupled with the fact that the retail inventory method is an averaging process  could produce inaccurate cost figures 
to reduce the risk of inaccuracy  the company employs the retail inventory method in multiple subclasses of inventory with similar gross margin  and analyzes markdown requirements at the stock number level based on factors such as inventory turn  average selling price  and inventory age 
in addition  the company accrues markdowns as necessary 
inherent in the analysis of both wholesale and retail inventory valuation are subjective judgments about current market conditions  fashion trends  and overall economic conditions 
failure to make appropriate conclusions regarding these factors may result in an overstatement or understatement of inventory value 
an analysis of the sensitivity of the judgments inherent in this process indicates that changes in the valuation percents of would result in a decrease in inventory value of approximately million as of february  impairment of long term assets as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company periodically assesses the realizability of its long lived assets and evaluates such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
asset impairment is determined to exist if estimated future cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  are less than the carrying amount 
inherent in the analysis of impairment are subjective judgments about future cash flows 
failure to make appropriate conclusions regarding these judgments may result in an overstatement of the value of long lived assets 
environmental and other contingencies the company is subject to certain loss contingencies related to environmental proceedings and other legal matters  including those disclosed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has made provisions for certain of these contingencies  including approximately million reflected in fiscal and million reflected in fiscal the company monitors these matters on an ongoing basis and at least quarterly management reviews the company s reserves and accruals in relation to each of them  adjusting provisions as management deems necessary in view of changes in available information 
changes in estimates of liability are reported in the periods when they occur 
consequently  management believes that its reserve in relation to each proceeding is a reasonable estimate of the probable loss connected to the proceeding  or in cases in which no reasonable estimate is possible  the minimum amount in the range of estimated losses  based upon its analysis of the facts and circumstance as of the close of the most recent fiscal quarter 
however  because of uncertainties and risks inherent in litigation generally and in environmental proceedings in particular  there can be no assurance that future developments will not require additional reserves to be set aside  that some or all reserves will be adequate or that the amounts of any such additional reserves or any such inadequacy will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial condition or results of operations

the company may borrow from time to time  particularly in the fall  to support seasonal working capital requirements should cash provided by operations not be sufficient to fund these items listed above

the company has made provisions for certain of these contingencies  including approximately million reflected in fiscal  million reflected in fiscal and  reflected in fiscal the company monitors these matters on an ongoing basis and at least quarterly management reviews the company s reserves and accruals in relation to each of them  adjusting provisions as management deems necessary in view of changes in available information 
changes in estimates of liability are reported in the periods when they occur 
consequently  management believes that its reserve in relation to each proceeding is a reasonable estimate of the probable loss connected to the proceeding  or in cases in which no reasonable estimate is possible  the minimum amount in the range of estimated losses  based upon its analysis of the facts and circumstances as of the close of the most recent fiscal quarter 
however  because of uncertainties and risks inherent in litigation generally and in environmental proceedings in particular  there can be no assurance that future developments will not require additional reserves to be set aside  that some or all reserves may not be adequate or that the amounts of any such additional reserves or any such inadequacy will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial condition or results of operations 
financial market risk the following discusses the company s exposure to financial market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
outstanding debt of the company the company s outstanding long term debt of million convertible subordinated notes due april bears interest at a fixed rate 
accordingly  there would be no near term impact on the company s interest expense due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
the fair value of the company s long term debt was million at february  based on a dealer quote 
cash and cash equivalents the company s cash and cash equivalent balances are invested in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on invested cash at february  as a result  the company considers the interest rate market risk implicit in these investments at february   to be low 
foreign currency exchange rate risk most purchases by the company from foreign sources are denominated in us dollars 
to the extent that import transactions are denominated in other currencies  it is the company s practice to hedge its risks through the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts 
at february   the company had million of foreign exchange contracts for euro 
the company s policy is not to speculate in derivative instruments for profit on the exchange rate price fluctuation and it does not hold any derivative instruments for trading purposes 
derivative instruments used as hedges must be effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged and must be designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract 
the loss on contracts outstanding at february  was million based on current spot rates 
as of february   a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates from market rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts by approximately million 
accounts receivable the company s accounts receivable balance at february  is concentrated in its two remaining wholesale businesses  which sell primarily to department stores and independent retailers across the united states 
one customer accounts for of the company s trade accounts receivable balance as of february  the company monitors the credit quality of its customers and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding credit risk  historical trends and other information  however  credit risk is affected by conditions or occurrences within the economy and the retail industry 
summary based on the company s overall market interest rate and foreign currency rate exposure at february   the company believes that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates or fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the company s consolidated financial position  result of operations or cash flows for fiscal would not be material
