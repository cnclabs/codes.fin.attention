overview gaiam is a multi channel lifestyle company providing information  goods and services to customers who value natural health personal development  and renewable energy 
gaiam was incorporated in boulder  colorado in to support conscious commerce  the practice of making purchasing decisions based on lifestyle and personal values 
in  gaiam began to expand nationally 
in  gaiam made a large investment in infrastructure and operating systems to support rapid growth 
from to  gaiam s revenues increased from million to million  representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
gaiam s business model is evolving as evidenced by the increase in the percentage of our revenues from our media and national retailer channels 
the increased focus on the above mentioned channels is planned and strategic in nature as it provides us with increased branding opportunity  higher operating contribution and greater mainstream penetration 
in  our business to business segment increased to of total revenues  up from in even with the segment shift to business to business  gaiam s gross margin remained strong at primarily because of our continued focus on higher margin proprietary products 
in  of our sales was comprised of proprietary products  up significantly from in gaiam s internal growth revenue growth from existing operations  excluding acquisitions until such acquisitions have been held for four previous fiscal quarters remained strong at during  up from in in january  we acquired real goods trading corp and consolidated real goods operations into gaiam s established infrastructure 
in february  we acquired the selfcare 
com url as well as selected inventory of medical selfcare from the assignee for the benefit of its creditors 
in second and third quarters of  we acquired the minority interest in three of our remaining four businesses with minority shareholders 
only gaiam 
com had a minority interest at the end of the year 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company believes that of the significant accounting polices described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the following involve a higher degree of complexity 
allowance for doubtful accounts methodology we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filings  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due 
for all other instances  we recognize reserves based on historical experience and review of the individual accounts outstanding 
inventories slow moving and obsolescence methodology we evaluate our inventory obsolescence reserve based on an item s current sales status 
if an item is determined to be a discontinued or slow moving item  it is reserved for based on an analysis of anticipated markdowns to sell thru current inventory values

business to business revenues increased to million in from million in gross profit  which consists of revenues less cost of sales primarily merchandise acquisition costs and in bound freight  increased to million in from million during as a percentage of revenue  gross profit was in compared to in this was primarily attributable to product mix diversification in our business to business segment and growth in the renewables business  which has a lower gross profit contribution than gaiam s other businesses 
gaiam continues to pursue growth of its proprietary product offerings  on which gaiam has better margins 
selling and operating expenses  which consist primarily of sales and marketing costs  commissions and fulfillment expenses  increased  which is less than the revenue increase of  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenues  selling and operating expenses decreased to in from in primarily due to leverage associated with the increased percentage of sales from our business to business segment

this financial information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
the results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of future results of operations 
fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter in thousands  except for per share data net revenue     gross profit     operating income loss    net income  net income per share weighted average shares outstanding    fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter in thousands  except for per share data net revenue     gross profit     operating income loss  net income  net income per share weighted average shares outstanding    note the aggregate of certain of the above amounts differs from that reported for the full fiscal year due to the effects of rounding 
quarterly fluctuations in gaiam s revenues and operating results are due to a number of factors  including the timing of new product introductions and mailings to customers  advertising  acquisitions including costs of acquisitions and expenses related to integration of acquisitions  competition  pricing of products by vendors and expenditures on our systems and infrastructure 
the impact on revenue and operating results  due to the timing and extent of these factors  can be significant 
our sales are also affected by seasonal influences 
on an aggregate basis  gaiam experiences its strongest revenues and net income in the fourth quarter due to increased holiday spending 
liquidity and capital resources gaiam s capital needs arise from working capital required to fund our operations  capital expenditures related to expansions and improvements to gaiam s infrastructure  development of e commerce  and funds required in connection with the acquisitions of new businesses and gaiam s anticipated future growth 
these capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including the rate of market acceptance of gaiam s product offerings  the ability to expand gaiam s customer base  the cost of ongoing upgrades to gaiam s product offerings  the level of expenditures for sales and marketing  the level of investment in distribution and other factors 
the timing and amount of these capital requirements cannot accurately be predicted 
additionally  gaiam will continue to evaluate possible investments in businesses  products and technologies  and plans to expand sales and marketing programs and conduct more aggressive brand promotions 
during the first six months of  gaiam raised million from the private placement of  shares of class a common stock and million in debentures 
the privately placed shares were sold at per share  and the convertible debentures matured on the earlier of one year after the date of the debenture or the closing date of the initial public offering 
in october  we repaid  of the convertible debentures and  simultaneous with the closing of the initial public offering  converted the remaining million in debentures to  shares of class a common stock 
gaiam s initial public offering of  shares of class a common stock at per share was completed in october giving effect to the conversion of million in debentures to  shares of common stock  the total issuance was  shares 
the offering s underwriters also exercised their overallotment option for  additional shares during november net proceeds to gaiam  after deducting all commissions and expenses associated with the offering  were million 
during the third quarter of  gaiam completed a secondary offering of  shares of class a common stock  plus an overallotment of  shares  at an offering price of per share 
net proceeds to gaiam  after deducting the underwriting commission and expenses  were approximately million 
gaiam used million of the proceeds to pay outstanding amounts under its wells fargo credit agreement 
gaiam has consolidated its line of credit agreements with wells fargo bank into one agreement 
the new credit agreement  which extends through october   permits borrowings of up to million based upon the collateral value of gaiam s accounts receivable  inventory and certain property and equipment 
borrowings under the wells fargo credit agreement bear interest at the lower of prime rate less basis points or libor plus basis points 
borrowings are secured by a pledge of gaiam s assets  and the agreement contains various financial covenants  including prohibiting the payment of cash dividends to gaiam shareholders and requiring maintenance of certain financial ratios 
at december   gaiam had no amounts outstanding under this agreement  and was in compliance with all the financial covenants 
gaiam s operating activities used net cash of million and million during and  respectively 
gaiam s net cash used in operating activities for arose primarily from increases in accounts receivable of million associated with growth in the business to business segment  increased inventories of million correlating to increased business volumes 
these uses were partially offset by net income of million 
gaiam s investing and acquisition activities used net cash of million during and provided net cash of million during during the first quarter of  gaiam completed its merger with real goods trading corporation  and also acquired all of the stock and certain assets of earthlings  inc and self care  inc 
for a total combined purchase price of million 
during the second quarter of  gaiam eliminated the minority interest in its organic clothing business by acquiring the remaining equity interest 
at the end of september  gaiam purchased the remaining interest in its two renewable energy businesses thus eliminating the minority interest in these businesses effective october  gaiam 
com  in which gaiam holds a interest and whole foods market currently owns  acquired the realgoods 
com  selfcare 
com and jademountain 
com websites from gaiam  and sold the bioenergy nutrients and healthsmart vitamins websites back to whole foods market 
this activity accounted for the majority of the use of net cash in gaiam s financing activities provided million in cash  primarily resulting form the completion of gaiam s secondary offering of class a common stock 
gaiam has commitments pursuant to lease agreements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these commitments 
we believe our available cash  cash expected to be generated from operations  and borrowing capabilities will be sufficient to fund our operations on both a short term and long term basis 
however  our projected cash needs may change as a result of acquisitions  unforeseen operational difficulties or other factors 
in the normal course of our business  we investigate  evaluate and discuss acquisition  joint venture  minority investment  strategic relationship and other business combination opportunities in the lohas lifestyles of health and sustainability market 
in the event of any future investment  acquisition or joint venture opportunities  we may consider using then available liquidity  issuing equity securities or incurring additional indebtedness 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not believe that any of our financial instruments have significant risk associated with market sensitivity 
we are not exposed to financial market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are only minimally impacted by changes in interest rates 
borrowings under our bank credit facility are at a variable rate of interest  but gaiam does not have any amounts outstanding under its credit line 
however  in the future  we may enter into transactions denominated in non us currencies or increase the level of our borrowings  which could increase our exposure to these market risks 
we have not used  and currently do not contemplate using  any derivative financial instruments
