the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation 
merchandise inventories are valued by the retail inventory method rim applied on a last in  first out lifo basis and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
under the rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain management judgements and estimates including  but not limited to  merchandise markon  markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation and resulting gross margins 
these estimates  coupled with the fact that the rim is an averaging process  can produce distorted cost figures under certain circumstances 
distortions could occur primarily by applying the rim to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost and selling price relationship and turnover  and applying rim to transactions over a period of time that include different rates of gross profit  such as seasonal merchandise 
to reduce the potential for such distortion in the inventory valuation  the company s rim utilizes over departments within lifo inventory pools in which fairly homogenous classes of merchandise are grouped 
management believes that the company s rim provides an inventory valuation which reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
long lived assets 
in evaluating the carrying value and future benefits of long lived assets  including goodwill  management performs a comparison of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long lived asset  including goodwill  to their carrying amount in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas management believes at this time that the long lived assets  including goodwill  carrying values and useful lives to be appropriate 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas no 
supersedes fasb no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that statement 
sfas no 
becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early application encouraged 
management does not believe the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material impact on the financial statements 
effective february   the beginning of the new fiscal year  sfas will be adopted 
sfas requires that goodwill will no longer be amortized  but will be subject to annual fair value based impairment tests 
in addition  a transitional impairment test is required upon the adoption date 
these impairment tests are conducted on each business of the company where goodwill is recorded  and may require two steps 
the initial step is designed to identify potential goodwill impairment by comparing an estimate of the fair value for each applicable business to its respective carrying value 
for those businesses where the carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value  a second step is performed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
the company is in the process of determining if its existing goodwill is impaired 
goodwill impairment  if any  will be recognized in the first quarter of and will be classified as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
customer accounts receivable 
customer accounts receivable is shown net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
the company calculates the allowance for uncollectible accounts using a model that analyzes factors such as bankruptcy filings  delinquency rates  historical charge off patterns  recovery rates  and other portfolio data 
the company s calculation is reviewed by management to assess whether  based on recent economic events  the allowance for uncollectible accounts is appropriate to estimate losses inherent in the portfolio 
income taxes 
the company has generated net operating loss carryforwards nol s from previous years 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with the nol s if it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to fully utilize it to offset future taxes 
it is possible that we could be profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that the company will be able to fully realize the deferred tax assets associated with the nol s 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although our cash tax payments would remain unaffected until the benefit of the nol s are realized 
recent accounting pronouncements in addition to sfas and sfas discussed above  in june  sfas was issued 
sfas primarily requires that all business combinations completed after june  be accounted for using the purchase method and establishes criteria for recognizing acquired intangible assets separately from goodwill 
the company will account for future business combinations under sfas item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business  primarily as a result of its variable rate borrowing 
the company has entered into variable to fixed rate interest rate swap agreements to effectively reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would not materially affect the company s financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
the company does not maintain a trading account for any class of financial instrument and is not directly subject to any foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
as a result  the company believes that its market risk exposure is not material to the company s financial position  liquidity or results of operations
