certain statements in this document may be considered to be forward looking statements as that term is defined in the us private securities litigation reform act of  such as statements that include the words expect  estimate  project  anticipate  should  intend  probability  risk  target  objective  and similar expressions or variations on such expressions 
in particular  this document includes forward looking statements relating  but not limited to  susquehanna s potential exposures to various types of market risks  such as interest rate risk and credit risk 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
for example  certain of the market risk disclosures are dependent on choices about key model characteristics and assumptions and are subject to various limitations 
by their nature  certain of the market risk disclosures are only estimates and could be materially different from what actually occurs in the future 
as a result  actual income gains and losses could materially differ from those that have been estimated 
other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those estimated by the forward looking statements contained in this document include  but are not limited to general economic conditions in market areas in which susquehanna has significant business activities or investments  the monetary and interest rate policies of the board of governors of the federal reserve system  inflation  deflation  unanticipated turbulence in interest rates  changes in laws  regulations  and taxes  changes in competition and pricing environments  natural disasters  the inability to hedge certain risks economically  the adequacy of loss reserves  acquisitions or restructuring  technological changes  changes in consumer spending and saving habits  and the success of susquehanna in managing the risks involved in the foregoing 
the management of susquehanna encourages readers of this report to understand forward looking statements to be strategic objectives rather than absolute targets of future performance 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made 
susquehanna does not update forward looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward looking statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
the following discussion and analysis  the purpose of which is to provide investors and others with information that susque hanna s management believes to be necessary for an understanding of its financial condition  changes in financial condition  and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  notes  and other information contained in this document 
results of operations summary of compared to susquehanna s net income for the year ended december   increased million  or  over net income of million 
susquehanna s earnings performance was enhanced by significant improvements in non interest income  which during the year exceeded of total revenues 
the million improvement in non interest income over the year ended december   was split almost equally between banking activities and non bank affiliate operations

amortization of such intangible assets is a non cash charge that significantly affects susquehanna s earnings and financial ratios 
tangible net income is actual net income increased by the tax effected amortization of those intangible assets that are deducted from stockholders equity in determining tier i capital

tangible net income  basic earnings per share  roa  and roe for were million    and  respectively 
net interest income taxable equivalent basis the major source of operating revenues for susquehanna is net interest income  which rose to a level of million in  million  or  above the million attained in net interest income increased in despite the substantial decline in the levels of total interest income  which was more than offset by a decline in total interest expense 
these declines are the direct result of the federal reserve bank s lowering of interest rates eleven times during net interest income is the income that remains after deducting  from total income generated by earning assets  the interest expense attributable to the acquisition of the funds required to support earning assets 
income from earning assets includes income from loans  income from investment securities and in come from short term investments 
the amount of interest income is dependent upon many factors including the volume of earning assets  the general level of interest rates  the dynamics of the change in interest rates  and levels of nonperforming loans 
the cost of funds varies with the amount of funds necessary to support earning assets  the rates paid to attract and hold deposits  rates paid on borrowed funds  and the levels of non interest bearing demand deposits and equity capital 
table presents average balances  taxable equivalent interest income and expenses  and yields earned or paid on these assets and liabilities of susquehanna 
for purposes of calculating taxable equivalent interest income  tax exempt interest has been adjusted using a marginal tax rate of in order to equate the yield to that of taxable interest rates 
net interest income as apercentage of net interest income and other income was   and for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
table illustrates that the increase in net interest income in compared with was primarily attributable to volumes 
the average growth in interest earning assets of million in over was due to a million increase in loans and a million increase in susquehanna s investment portfolio 
as illustrated in table  the tax equivalent yield on earning assets for decreased to from in this decrease was due to the steady drop in interest rates throughout  which was the primary cause for the million decrease in taxable equivalent interest income

for purposes of calculating yields on tax advantaged interest income  the taxable equivalent is made to equate tax advantaged interest on the same basis as taxable interest 
the marginal tax rate is 
with was also attributed to lower interest rates 
decreases in rates paid for interest bearing deposits  short term borrowings  and federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings were the primary reasons for the million decrease in interest expense 
consequently  the average cost of funds decreased from in to in also contributing to the lower cost of funds was an increase in lower cost deposits offsetting a decrease in higher cost borrowings 
as a result of the preceding comments  susquehanna s net interest margin  on a taxable equivalent basis  increased from in to in variances do occur in the net interest margin  as an exact repricing of assets and liabilities is not possible 
a further explanation of the impact of asset and liability repricing is found in the section titled market risks 
provision and allowance for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses is the expense necessary to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level adequate to absorb management s estimate of inherent losses in the loan and lease portfolio 
susquehanna s provision for loan and lease losses is based upon management s quarterly review of the loan portfolio 
the purpose of the review is to assess loan quality  identify impaired loans  analyze delinquencies  ascertain loan growth  evaluate potential charge offs and recoveries  and assess general economic conditions in the markets its affiliates serve 
commercial and real estate loans are internally risk rated by susquehanna s loan officers and periodically reviewed by loan quality personnel 
consumer  residential real estate loans  and leases are generally analyzed in the aggregate as they are of relative small dollar size and homogeneous in nature 
in addition to economic conditions  consideration of loan portfolio diversification  delinquency  and historic loss experience  consideration is also given in examinations performed by the regulatory authorities 
to determine the allowance and corresponding loan and lease loss provision  the amount required for specific loans is first determined 
for certain commercial and construction loans  this amount is based upon specific borrower data determined by reviewing individual non performing  delinquent  or potentially troubled credits 
the remaining commercial loans as well as consumer  residential real estate  and lease allowances  which may include specific reserves  generally are based upon recent charge off and delinquency history  other known trends and expected losses over the remaining lives of these loans  as well as the condition of local  regional  and national economies 
in addition  a reserve for unused commitments is determined using the same criteria applied to the remaining commercial portfolio by risk rating type

to ensure adequacy to a higher degree of confidence  a portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses is considered unallocated 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is the amount which  when added to these allocated amounts  brings the total to the amount deemed adequate by management at that time 
this unallocated portion is available to absorb losses sustained anywhere within the loan and lease portfolios 
table presents this allocation 
the loan portfolio represents loans and leases made primarily within susquehanna s market area  which includes principally central and southeastern pennsylvania  maryland  and new jersey  and to a lesser extent  southwestern pennsylvania  con necticut  delaware  west virginia  northern virginia  and the southern tier of new york state 
determining the level of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses at any given period is difficult  particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information which is often subjective and changing rapidly 
the review of the loan and lease portfolios is a continuing event in light of a changing economy and the dynamics of the banking and regulatory environment 
in management s opinion  the allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate at december  there can be no assurance  however  that susquehanna will not sustain losses in future periods  which could be greater than the size of the allowance at december  as illustrated in table  the provision for loan and lease losses was million for compared to million in net charge offs  as presented in table  were million in compared with million in the allowance for loan and lease losses at december   was of period end loans and leases  or million  compared with or million at december  should the economic climate deteriorate further  borrowers may experience difficulty  and the level of non performing loans and assets  charge offs  and delinquencies could rise and require further increases in the provision 
in addition  regulatory authorities  as an integral part of their examinations  periodically review the allowance for possible loan and lease losses 
they may require additions to allowances based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of examination 
it is the policy of susquehanna not to renegotiate the terms of a loan simply because of a delinquency status 
rather  a loan is typically transferred to non accrual status if it is not well secured and in the process of collection  and is considered delinquent in payment if either principal or interest is past due beyond days 
interest income received on non performing loans in and was million and million  respectively 
interest income which would have been recorded on these loans under the original terms was million and million for and  respectively 
at december   sus quehanna had no outstanding commitments to advance additional funds with respect to these non performing loans 
table is an analysis of the provision levels as well as the activity in the allowance for loan and lease losses for the past five years 
table reflects the five year history of non performing assets and loans and leases contractually past due days and still accruing 
total non performing assets at december  and  were and million  respectively  including million and million  respectively  in other real estate acquired through foreclosure 
non performing assets as a percentage of period end loans and leases and other real estate owned was at december   a decline from at december  real estate acquired through foreclosure is carried at its fair value  which is calculated as the lower of the recorded amount of the loan for which the foreclosed property served as collateral  or the fair market value of the property as determined by a current appraisal less estimated costs to sell 
prior to foreclosure  the recorded amount of the loan is written down  if necessary  to fair value by charging the allowance for loan and lease losses 
subsequent to foreclosure  gains or losses on the sale of real estate acquired through foreclosure are recorded in operating income  and any losses determined as a result of periodic valuations are charged to other operating expense 
loans with principal and or interest delinquent days or more and still accruing interest were million at december   a decrease from million at december  a softening of certain segments of the economy may adversely affect certain borrowers and may cause additional loans to become past due beyond days or be placed on non accrual status because of uncertainty of receiving full payment of either principal or interest on these loans 
potential problem loans consist of loans that are performing under contract but for which potential credit problems have caused susquehanna to place them on its internally monitored loan list 
at december   such loans  which are not included in table  amounted to million 
depending upon the state of the economy and the impact thereon to these borrowers  as well as future events such as regulatory examination assessments  these loans and others not currently so identified could be classified as non performing assets in the future 
related party transaction and residual value risk in the third quarter of  hann entered into a servicing agreement with auto lenders liquidation center  inc auto lenders  pursuant to which hann effectively transferred to auto lenders all residual risk of the managed auto lease portfolio originated by hann and all residual risk on any new leases originated over the term of the agreement 
michael j 
wimmer  who is a member of susquehanna s board of directors and the chief executive officer of hann  along with his immediate family  owns of the outstanding equity interest of auto lenders 
auto lenders  which was formed in  is a used vehicle remarketer with three retail locations in new jersey 
under this servicing agreement  auto lenders agreed to purchase the beneficial interest in all vehicles returned by the obligors at the scheduled expiration of the related leases for a purchase price equal to the stated residual value of such vehicles 
further  hann agreed to set its stated residual values in accordance with the standards approved in advance by auto lenders  and hann agreed to pay to auto lenders an upfront fee of million  as shown in table  to cover all the auto leases serviced by hann which had been originated by hann prior to the agreement 
hann also agreed to make monthly guaranty payments to auto lenders based upon a fixed schedule covering a three year period 
at the end of each year  the servicing agreement may be renewed by the mutual agreement of the parties for an additional one year term beyond the current three year term  subject to renegotiation of the pay ments 
during the renewal process  competitive quotes are obtained by hann from third parties to determine the best remarketing alternative for hann 
the aggregate fees paid by hann to auto lenders under the servicing agreement in were million 
under the servicing agreement  auto lenders retains all residual gains and bears all residual losses with respect to the vehicles 
the obligations of auto lenders under the servicing agreement are secured by a guaranty dated december   executed by mr 
wimmer in favor of hann

service charges on deposit accounts increased million in over as the introduction of a new overdraft program improved fee collection significantly 
contributing to the million increase in other operating income was improved debit card volume resulting from new marketing efforts 
gain on sale of loans and leases was million in compared with million in during the second quarter of  hann sold approximately million in automobile leases 
in conjunction with this transaction  hann realized a million gain on the sale 
during  susquehanna affiliate banks sold approximately million of mortgage loans that were originated for resale 
in conjunction with the sale of mortgage loans  susquehanna realized approximately million in gains 
in the third quarter of  susquehanna sold its credit card portfolio  which resulted in a gain of million 
during  susquehanna affiliate banks sold approximately million of mortgage loans which resulted in a gain of million 
all other categories experienced modest gains over the prior year  as well 
other expenses non interest expenses are categorized into the following nine groupings employee related expenses  which include salaries  fringe benefits  and employment taxes  occupancy expenses  which include depreciation  rents  maintenance  utilities  and insurance  furniture and equipment expenses  which include depreciation  rents  and maintenance  amortization of intangible assets  vehicle residual value expense  vehicle delivery and preparation expense  merchant credit card servicing expense  restructuring charges  and other expenses detailed in table incurred in operating susquehanna s business 
non interest expense increased million  or  in over salaries and employee benefits increased million  or  from to the increase in salaries and benefits was primarily due to normal annual salary increases  recent branch openings  new revenue producing positions  and higher health benefit costs

consequently  year vehicle residual value expense included both actual residual value losses and residual value guarantee fees  whereas year included only residual value guarantee fees 
vehicle delivery and preparation expense for increased million over the prior year s expense due to costs associated with an increased number of vehicles being prepared for retail sale during all other expenses increased million see table  with notable increases in postage and delivery costs of million  and other real estate expenses of million 
while modest increases were realized in most of the other categories  a decrease of million was recorded in legal and professional  primarily due to less acquisition related activity 
income taxes susquehanna s effective tax rate for was compared to in the effective rate for was increased because of reduced levels of tax advantaged income 
as tax advantaged loans and securities continue to mature  and the opportunities for investment in additional tax advantaged enterprises become less attractive due to certain provisions of the tax reform act of  effective tax rates may increase in the years ahead 
however  beginning in  as required by the fasb that issued sfas  susquehanna will no longer amortize goodwill created in previous business combinations 
the reduction in pre tax amortization expense of million will have a favorable impact on susquehanna s effective tax rate  as most of the amortization expense was not deductible from taxable income 
financial condition investment securities susquehanna follows sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
this accounting pronouncement requires the segregation of investment securities into three categories  each having a distinct accounting treatment held to maturity  trading  or available for sale 
securities identified as held to maturity continue to be carried at their amortized cost and  except for limited circumstances  may not be sold prior to maturity 
securities identified as available for sale must be reported at their market or fair value  and the difference between that value and their amortized cost recorded in the equity section  net of taxes 
as a result  total equity of susquehanna was positively impacted by million as the unrealized gains or losses for available for sale securities  changed from a negative million at december   to a positive million at december  securities identified as trading account securities are marked to market  with the change recorded in the income statement

while sfas requires segregation into held to maturity and available for sale categories see table  it does not change susquehanna s policy concerning the purchase of only high quality securities 
strategies employed address liquidity  capital adequacy  and net interest margin considerations which then determine the assignment of purchases into these two categories 
table illustrates the maturities of these security portfolios and the weighted average yields based upon amortized costs 
yields are shown on a tax equivalent basis assuming a federal income tax rate 
at december   susquehanna held no securities of one issuer  other than us government obligations  where the aggregate book value exceeded ten percent of stockholders equity 
susquehanna adopted sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  as of january  concurrent with adoption of this standard  and as permitted by its provisions  approximately million of securities held to maturity were reclassified as securities available for sale 
this reclassification resulted in an after tax gain of approximately million  which was recorded in other comprehensive income 
loans and leases table presents the loans outstanding  by type of loan  in susquehanna s portfolio for the past five years 
in  mortgage loans increased million  commercial loans increased million  and construction loans grew by million compared to consumer loans declined million in from susquehanna s banking subsidiaries have historically reported a significant amount of loans secured by real estate  as depicted in table many of these loans have real estate collateral taken as additional security not related to the acquisition of the real estate pledged 
open end home equity loans amounted to million at december   and an additional million was lent against junior liens on residential properties during during  senior liens on family residential properties totaled million  and much of the million in loans secured by non farm  non residential properties represented collateralization of operating lines  or term loans that finance equipment  inventory  or receivables 
loans secured by farmland totaled million  while loans secured by multi family residential properties totaled million at december  leases declined by million in compared to  as most of hann s new lease production in was either sold or originated for other institutions 
table represents the maturity of commercial  financial  and agricultural loans as well as real estate construction loans 
these loans with maturities after consist of million with fixed rate pricing and million with variable rate pricing 
deposits susquehanna s deposit base is consumer oriented  consisting of time deposits  primarily certificates of deposit of various terms  interest bearing demand accounts  savings accounts  and demand deposits 
the average amounts of deposits by type are summarized in table susquehanna does not rely upon time deposits of  or more as a principal source of funds  as they represent of total deposits 
table presents a breakdown by maturity of time deposits of  or more as of december  market risks the types of market risk exposures generally faced by banking entities include interest rate risk  liquidity risk  equity market price risk  foreign currency risk  and commodity price risk 
due to the nature of its operations  only interest rate risk and liquidity risk are significant to susquehanna 
liquidity and interest rate risk are related but distinctly different from one another 
the maintenance of adequate liquidity the ability to meet the cash requirements of its customers and other financial commitments is a fundamental aspect of susquehanna s asset liability management strategy 
susquehan na s policy of diversifying its funding sources purchased funds  repurchase agreements  and deposit accounts allows it to avoid undue concentration in any single financial market and also to avoid heavy funding requirements within short periods of time 
at december   susquehanna s subsidiary banks and savings bank have unused lines of credit available to them from various fhlbs of million 
however  liquidity is not entirely dependent on increasing susquehanna s liability balances 
liquidity can also be generated from maturing or readily marketable assets 
the carrying value of investment securities maturing within one year amounted to million at december  these maturing investments represented of total investment securities 
cash and due from banks amounted to million and unrestricted short term investments amounted to million for the year ended december   both of which represent additional sources of liquidity

interest rate risk focuses on maintaining stability in the net interest margin  an important factor in earnings growth 
interest rate sensitivity is the matching or mismatching of the maturity and rate structure of the interest bearing assets and liabilities 
it is the objective of management to control the difference in the timing of the rate changes for these assets and liabilities to preserve a satisfactory net interest margin 
in doing so  susquehanna endeavors to maximize earnings in an environment of changing interest rates 
however  there is a lag in maintaining the desired matching because the repricing of products occurs at varying time intervals 
susquehanna employs a variety of methods to monitor interest rate risk 
by dividing the assets and liabilities into three groups fixed rate  floating rate  and those which reprice only at management s discretion strategies are developed which are designed to minimize exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
management also utilizes gap analysis to evaluate rate sensitivity at a given point in time 
table illustrates susquehanna s estimated interest rate sen sitivity and periodic and cumulative gap positions as calculated at december  and these estimates include anticipated paydowns on commercial and residential loans  mortgage backed securities  and certain assumptions regarding core deposits 
traditionally  an institution with more assets repricing than liabilities over a given time frame is considered asset sensitive  and one with more liabilities repricing than assets is considered liability sensitive 
an asset sensitive institution will generally benefit from rising rates  and a liability sensitive institution will generally benefit from declining rates 
however  imbedded options  such as a call feature on a bond or a prepayment option on a loan  may impact the magnitude and direction of interest rate sensitivity 
in addition to periodic gap reports comparing the sensitivity of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in interest rates  management also utilizes an in house simulation model that measures susquehanna s exposure to interest rate risk 
this model calculates the income effect and the economic value of assets  liabilities  and equity at current and forecasted interest rates  and at hypothetical higher and lower table loan and lease portfolio at december percentage percentage of loans to of loans to dollars in thousands amount total loans amount total loans commercial  financial  and agricultural   real estate construction   real estate mortgage   consumer   leases   total   table loan maturity and interest sensitivity dollars in thousands at december under one one to five over five maturity year years years total commercial  financial  and agricultural     real estate construction     rate sensitivity of loans with maturities greater than year variable rate  fixed rate  table allocation of allowance for loan and lease losses dollars in thousands at december commercial  financial  and agricultural      real estate construction      real estate mortgage      consumer      leases      unused commitments      unallocated     total      interest rates at one percent intervals 
the income effect and economic value of defined categories of financial instruments is calculated by the model using estimated cash flows based on imbedded options  prepayments  early withdrawals  and weighted average contractual rates and terms 
for economic value calculations  the model also considers discount rates for similar financial instruments 
the economic value of longer term fixed rate financial instruments are generally more sensitive to changes in interest rates 
adjustable rate and variable rate financial instruments largely reflect only a change in economic value representing the difference between the contractual and discounted rates until the next contractual interest rate repricing date  unless subject to rate caps and floors 
a substantial portion of susquehanna s loans consists of commercial and residential mortgage loans containing significant imbedded options which permit the borrower to repay the principal balance of the loan prior to maturity prepayments without penalty 
a loan s susceptibility for prepayment is dependent upon a number of factors  including the current interest rate versus the contractual interest rate of the loan  the financial ability of the borrower to refinance  and the economic benefit and availability of refinancing at attractive terms 
also  refinancing may depend upon economic and other factors in specific geographic areas that affect the sales and price levels of residential property 
in a changing interest rate environment  prepayments may increase or decrease depending on the current relative levels and expectations of future short and long term interest rates 
since a significant portion of susquehanna s loan portfolio has adjustable or variable rates  prepayments on such loans generally increase when long term interest rates fall or are at historically low levels relative to short term interest rates and fixed rate loans are economically more desirable 
percentage percentage percentage of loans to of loans to of loans to amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans table loan concentrations substantially all of susquehanna s loans and leases are to enterprises and individuals in pennsylvania  maryland  new jersey  and new york 
at december   susquehanna s portfolio included the following concentrations total as a of nonperforming dollars in thousands permanent construction all other amount total loans in each category housing developments     office buildings and warehouses     retailing     manufacturing     hotels motels     agriculture    wholesalers    investment securities  other than those with early call provisions and mortgage backed securities  generally do not have significant imbedded options and repay pursuant to specific terms until maturity 
while savings and checking deposits generally may be withdrawn upon the customer s request without prior notice  a continuing relationship with customers resulting in future deposits and withdrawals is generally predictable  resulting in a dependable source of funds 
time deposits generally have early withdrawal penalties  while term fhlb borrowings and subordinated notes have prepayment penalties which discourage customer withdrawal of time deposits and prepayment of fhlb borrowings and subordinated notes prior to maturity 
susquehanna s loans are primarily indexed to national interest indices 
when such loans are funded by interest bearing liabilities which are determined by other indices  primarily deposits and fhlb borrowings  a changing interest rate environment may result in different levels of changes in the different indices  resulting in disproportionate changes in the value of  and the net earnings generated from  such financial instruments 
each index is unique and is influenced by different external factors  therefore  the historical relationships in various indices may not be indicative of the actual change which may result in a changing interest rate environment 
tables and reflect the estimated income effect and economic value of assets  liabilities  and equity calculated using certain assumptions determined by susquehanna as of decem ber  and  at current interest rates and at hypothetical higher and lower interest rates in one and two percent increments 
as noted in table  the economic value of equity at risk as of december   is four percent at an interest rate change of plus two percent  while table discloses that net interest income at risk as of december   is eight percent at an interest rate change of minus two percent 
at december   susquehanna was an asset sensitive institution and should benefit from a rise in interest rates in  if that should occur 
securitizations and off balance sheet financings assets securitizations and other off balance sheet financings can further impact liquidity and interest rate risk

assets financed in the first three of these manners generally are not reflected on susquehanna s consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   hann s off balance sheet  managed portfolio was funded in the following manners agency arrangements  million  asset securitization transactions  million  and sale leaseback transactions  million 
agency arrangements generally occur on similar economic terms and generally result in no accounting gains or losses to hann and no retention of credit  residual value  or interest rate risk with respect to the sold assets 
agency arrangements involve the origination and servicing by hann of automobile leases for other financial institutions 
hann generally is entitled to receive all of the administrative fees collected from obligors  a servicing fee  and an origination fee per lease 
lease sales are generally accounted for as sales under sfas in asset securitization transactions  hann generally sells or contributes the beneficial interest in fixed rate automobile leases and related vehicles to a wholly owned  special purpose entity  or spe 
the spe finances the purchase by borrowing funds from a non related  asset backed commercial paper issuer 
hann continues to act as servicer for the sold portfolio and hann is entitled to receive all of the administrative fees collected from obligors 
in addition  hann also receives a servicing fee based upon a percentage of the dollar amount of assets serviced 
these transactions are generally accounted for as sales under the guidelines of sfas neither hann nor susquehanna provides recourse for credit losses

tion agreements or retains the related interest rate risk 
although neither hann nor susquehanna has retained residual risk in the vehicle leases and related vehicles  in the event of a breach by auto lenders of its obligation under the servicing agreement  described earlier in the discussion titled related party transaction and residual value risk  susquehanna would be required to reimburse up to million under a letter of credit facility for losses suffered by the investors to the extent of amounts not paid by auto lenders 
as of december   hann had one outstanding asset securitization transaction 
the transaction documents contain several requirements  obligations  liabilities  provisions  and consequences  including events of default  which become applicable upon  among other conditions  the failure of the sold and pledged portfolios to meet certain performance tests 
the spe generally retains the right to receive excess cash flows from the sold portfolio and  under sfas  hann is required to recognize a receivable representing the present value of these excess cash flows  which is subordinate to the investors interests 
the value of this recorded interest is subject to credit  prepayment  and interest rate risks 
at decem ber   this recorded interest was million of which million represents the remaining interest only asset and million is a valuation adjustment which is recognized as other comprehensive income  net of taxes 
in december  hann sold and leased back the beneficial interest in million of automobiles subject to operating leases under a master lease agreement that has an eight year term with an early buyout option on january  for accounting purposes  the transaction is treated as a sale and an operating lease 
to support its obligations under the master lease agreement  hann pledges the beneficial interest in an additional million of automobile leases and related vehicles 
hann is expected to earn approximately million in other income over the term of the master lease agreement  which includes million of estimated net rental income  or the difference between the operating lease payments received by hann and the payments made by hann under the master lease agreement 
the estimated net rental income will be partially offset by the amortization of transaction costs of approximately million  which includes a million deferred loss on an interest rate swap 
susquehanna entered into an interest rate swap in order to fix the return on the transaction  while leases originated for the sale leaseback were being held in a warehouse facility during the ten month production period 
the transaction documents contain several requirements  obligations  liabilities  provisions  and consequences which become applicable upon the occurrence of an early amortization event 
an early amortization event includes the failure of the sold and pledged portfolios to meet certain performance tests or the failure of susquehanna to continue to maintain its investment grade senior unsecured long term debt ratings 
this rating provision can be cured by susque hanna by obtaining a million letter of credit from an eligible financial institution for the benefit of the equity participants in the transaction 
this is referred to in table as contingent cash collateral 
for example  after an early amortization event  substitutions are no longer permitted  which means that the sales proceeds from the sold vehicles following termination of the related auto leases may not be used to purchase replacement vehicles and leases 
instead  these proceeds are required to make termination and other payments under the master lease agreement 
as of december   the obligation to make these termination and other payments is collateralized by a cash deposit of million 
table presents certain contractual obligations and commercial commitments  including the guarantees of susquehanna on behalf of its subsidiaries  and their expected year of payment or expiration 
capital adequacy risk based capital ratios  based upon guidelines adopted by bank regulators in  focus upon credit risk 
assets and certain off balance sheet items are segmented into one of four broad risk categories and weighted according to the relative percentage of credit risk assigned by the regulatory authorities 
off balance sheet instruments are converted into a balance sheet credit equivalent before being assigned to one of the four risk weighted categories 
to supplement the risk based capital ratios  the regulators issued a minimum leverage ratio guideline tier capital as a percentage of average assets less excludable intangibles 
capital elements are segmented into two tiers 
tier capital represents stockholders equity reduced by excludable intangibles  while tier capital represents certain allowable long term debt  the portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses equal to of risk adjusted assets  and of the unrealized gain on equity securities 
the sum of tier capital and tier capital is total risk based capital 
the maintenance of a strong capital base at both the parent company level as well as at each bank affiliate is an important aspect of susquehanna s philosophy 
table illustrates these capital ratios for each bank and savings bank subsidiary and susquehanna on a consolidated basis 
susquehanna and each of its banking and savings bank subsidiaries have leverage and risk weighted ratios well in excess of regulatory minimums  and each entity is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
recent accounting pronouncements on july   the fasb issued sfas no 
 sfas business combinations  and sfas no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas supercedes accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 business combinations 
the most significant changes made by sfas are requiring that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   establishing specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill  and requiring unallocated negative goodwill to be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain 
management has reviewed sfas and has determined that the statement has no effect on its current financial position or results of operations 
sfas supercedes apb  intangible assets 
sfas primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
the most significant changes made by sfas are goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized  goodwill will be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level  intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life will be tested for impairment at least annually  and the amortization period of intangible assets with finite table contractual obligations and commercial commitments payments due by period less than over contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt    operating leases      contingent cash collateral   commitment expiration less than over other commercial commitments total year years years years stand by letters of credit    guarantees   other commercial commitments  principally lines of credit    lives will no longer be limited to forty years 
the provision of sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after de cember  management estimates that amortization expense for will be reduced by approximately million 
management has not yet performed an impairment test of goodwill 
critical accounting policies susquehanna has established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation of its financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of susquehanna are described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experiences and other factors which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of susquehanna 
susquehanna believes that the allowance for loan and lease losses  which is discussed in the section titled provision and allowance for loan and lease losses  and the treatment of securitizations and off balance sheet financing  which is discussed in the section titled securitizations and off balance sheet financing  both require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
see footnote summary of significant accounting policies for a detailed description of suquehanna s estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan and lease losses and treatment of recorded interests in securitized assets  and footnote financial instruments with off balance sheet risk
