item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview miller is an independent oil and gas exploration  development and production company that has developed a base of producing properties and inventory of prospects concentrated primarily in mississippi 
results of operations the following table summarizes production volumes  average sales prices and average costs for the company s oil and natural gas operations for the periods presented in thousands  except per unit amounts year ended december  production volumes crude oil and condensate mbbls natural gas mmcf natural gas equivalent mmcfe revenues natural gas crude oil and condensate operating expenses lease operating expenses and production taxes depletion  depreciation and amortization cost ceiling writedown general and administrative interest expense net loss average sales prices crude oil and condensate per bbl natural gas per mcf natural gas equivalent per mcfe average costs per mcfe lease operating expenses and production taxes depletion  depreciation and amortization cost ceiling writedown general and administrative year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues for the years ended december  and include approximately million and million of hedging losses  respectively see risk management activities and derivative transactions below 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued production volumes for natural gas during the year ended december  decreased to  mmcf from  mmcf for the year ended december  oil production volumes decreased to mbbls for the year ended december  compared to mbbls for the same period of the decrease in production is primarily attributable to less than expected results from recent drilling activities 
in  the company will focus more of its efforts toward drilling lower risk development wells and strategic reserve acquisitions  joint ventures and or corporate combinations with the objective of reversing the declining production trend and adding to and diversifying the reserve base 
average realized natural gas prices increased to per mcf for the year ended december  from per mcf for the year ended december  due to high natural gas commodity prices the company experienced during the first quarter of that were partially offset by low prices during the fourth quarter of average realized oil prices decreased to per barrel during the year ended december  from per barrel for the year ended december  as oil commodity prices fell due primarily to the effect of the economic recession in the united states and the global oil supply imbalance 
lease operating expenses loe and production taxes for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the loe component was unchanged at million for and production taxes  however  decreased to million for compared to million for the mississippi production tax is calculated by taking of the gross value of the crude oil and natural gas 
it would  therefore  be expected that the change in production tax expense would approximate the same percentage decrease that oil and natural gas revenues experienced on a year over year basis 
the state of mississippi has enacted legislation that provides for production tax exemptions during periods of low commodity prices 
the exemptions apply when the state wide average monthly price for oil or natural gas falls below a level pre determined by statute 
due to oil and natural gas price volatility  the mississippi production tax exemptions have phased in and out over the past two years which partially offsets the decrease in production taxes 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december   primarily due to decreased production volumes and a reduced property cost basis after ceiling test writedowns in the second and third quarters of see below 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the same period in this decrease is attributable to continuing efforts to control costs 
using unescalated period end prices net of applicable basis adjustments at december   of per mcf of natural gas and per barrel of oil  the company has recognized a non cash cost ceiling writedown of million for the year then ended 
sharply lower commodity prices at period end  less than expected results from recent drilling activities and expiration of leaseholds are the primary factors for the aggregate cost ceiling writedown 
in  the company will focus more of its efforts toward drilling lower risk development wells and strategic reserve acquisitions with the objective of reversing the declining production trend and adding reserves 
using unescalated period end prices at december  of per mcfe  the company had no impairment of oil and gas properties 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the higher interest expense in is attributable to million of non cash interest expense that was required to be recorded in connection with the guardian convertible note payable and the issuance of common stock warrants to guardian  more fully discussed in capital resources and liquidity below and in note to the consolidated financial statements and higher effective interest rates and average outstanding debt balance in compared to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued on july   the company entered into a senior credit facility with bank one  texas  na bank one which replaced the then existing credit facility with bank of montreal 
in connection with extinguishment of the debt with bank of montreal  the company reported an extraordinary loss  net of income taxes of million for the remaining unamortized debt expenses for the year ended december  net loss for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   as a result of the factors described above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of increased prices for oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas revenues for the years ended december  and include approximately million and million of hedging losses  respectively see risk management activities and derivative transactions below 
production volumes for natural gas during the year ended december  decreased to  mmcf from  mmcf for the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to declining production in the mississippi salt basin properties 
the company installed compressors on all company operated properties in the salt basin and have reperforated and conducted other stimulation techniques to boost and or stabilize production rates 
the effect on natural gas production of the sale of the company s antrim shale properties in michigan and certain non strategic producing properties in louisiana and texas in early have been offset by increased production from non antrim shale production in the michigan basin during average natural gas prices increased to per mcf for the year ended december  from per mcf for the year ended december  due to improved natural gas commodity prices during oil production volumes decreased to mbbls for the year ended december  compared to mbbls the same period of decreased production in the mississippi salt basin accounted for of the change with the remaining decline being attributable to the sale of producing properties in louisiana and texas in early and in june average oil prices increased to per barrel during the year ended december  from per barrel for the year ended december  lease operating expenses loe and production taxes for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  loe increased to million for compared to million for this increase is comprised of a million increase in expenses attributable to mississippi salt basin wells and a decrease in expenses resulting from the sale of producing properties in michigan  louisiana and texas during and compressor installation and related rental expenses and the costs of various reperforation and well stimulation projects account for the increased loe on the salt basin properties 
production taxes increased to million for compared to million for substantially all of this increase is attributable to the salt basin properties 
since june  the average crude oil and natural gas prices exceeded the price ceiling established by the state of mississippi  therefore exemption from the production tax established by mississippi statute no longer applied 
also  since the mississippi production tax is calculated by taking of the gross value of the crude oil and natural gas  the upward trend in the amount of production tax expense followed the substantial increase in commodity prices that occurred during depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   primarily due to an increased property cost basis from capital expenditures 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the same period in this decrease is attributable to the cost reduction plan implemented in may the primary components of the general and administrative expense reduction item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued include a million decrease in salaries  wages  and related employee benefits  a million decrease in legal and professional fees  and a million decrease in travel expenses 
these decreases were offset by a million reduction in the amount of capitalized general and administrative expenses in using unescalated period end prices at december  of per mcfe  the company had no impairment of oil and gas properties 
using unescalated period end prices at december   of per mcfe  the company would have recognized a non cash impairment of oil and gas properties in the amount of approximately million pre tax 
however  on the basis of the improvement in pricing experienced subsequent to period end of per mcfe in march  the company determined that a writedown was not required 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  this increase is attributable to million of non cash interest expense that was required to be recorded in connection with the guardian convertible note payable and the issuance of common stock warrants to guardian  more fully discussed in capital resources and liquidity below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
had the million interest expense entry not been required  interest expense would have actually decreased by to million from million 
this decrease is attributable to a reduction in total debt to million at december  from million at december  and the lower interest rate provided for under the credit facility agreement with the company s new lender  bank one 
on july   the company entered into a senior credit facility with bank one which replaced the existing credit facility with bank of montreal 
in connection with extinguishment of the debt with bank of montreal  the company reported an extraordinary loss  net of income taxes of million for the remaining unamortized debt expenses 
net loss for the year ended december   decreased to million from million for the year ended december   as a result of the factors described above 
capital resources and liquidity operating  investing  and financing activities the company s primary ongoing source of liquidity is cash generated from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided in compared to was the primary result of a decline in operating income caused by declining production 
the increase in cash provided in compared to was primarily attributable to improved operating results because of the significantly increased commodity prices in and to drilling advances received from joint interest partners relating to the drilling of wells 
the company s primary use of cash has been for its exploration and development activities 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in compared to was attributable to increased exploration and development expenditures and a decrease in proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties 
the increase in cash used in compared to was due to a million decrease in proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties offset by a decrease in exploration and development expenditures of million 
the company s primary sources and uses of capital have been from the company s bank credit facilities 
net cash used in financing activities was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in compared to is attributable to a lower net reduction in long term debt in compared to and the result of the million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock in the decrease in cash used in compared to was primarily a result of million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock offset by a reduction in net borrowings on long term debt 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued financing arrangements on july   the company entered into a new senior credit facility with bank one  which replaced the then existing credit facility with bank of montreal 
the new credit facility has a month term with an interest rate of either bank one prime plus or libor plus  at the company s option 
the company s obligations under the credit facility are secured by a lien on all of its real and personal property 
the company s new borrowing base determined by bank one as of march   was million 
commencing june   the borrowing base will be reduced by million per month until the next re determination scheduled for july  at december   the outstanding balance under the company s credit facility with bank one was million 
the bank one credit facility includes certain negative covenants that impose restrictions on the company with respect to  among other things  incurrence of additional indebtedness  limitations on financial ratios  making investments and mergers and consolidation 
as of december   the company requested and obtained a waiver from bank one of non compliance with the current ratio and maintenance of specified levels of commodity hedge covenants as required by the credit facility 
the company also requested an amendment to the minimum net worth covenant that would exclude cost ceiling writedowns from the calculations 
bank one has agreed to provide this amendment 
the obligations under the new credit facility are secured by a lien on all of the company s real and personal property 
on april   the company issued a million note payable to one of its suppliers  veritas dgc land  inc the veritas note  for the outstanding balance due to veritas for past services provided in and the principal obligation under the veritas note was originally due on april  on july   the note was amended as more fully described below 
on april   the company also entered into an agreement the warrant agreement to issue warrants to veritas that entitle veritas to purchase shares of common stock in lieu of receiving cash payments for the accrued interest obligations under the veritas note 
the warrant agreement required the company to issue warrants to veritas in conjunction with the signing of the warrant agreement  as well as on the six and  at the company s option  and month anniversaries of the warrant agreement 
the warrants issued equal of the then current outstanding principal balance of the veritas note 
the number of shares issued upon exercise of the warrants issued on april   and on the six month anniversary was determined based upon a five day weighted average closing price of the company s common stock at april  the exercise price of each warrant is per share 
on april   warrants exercisable for  shares of common stock were issued to veritas in connection with execution of the veritas note 
on october  and april   warrants exercisable for another  and  shares  respectively  of common stock were issued to veritas 
the company ratably recognizes the prepaid interest into expense over the period to which it relates 
for the years ended december  and  the company recognized non cash interest expense of approximately  and  respectively  related to the veritas note payable 
effective november   veritas exercised  warrants to receive  shares net of exercise price of company common stock 
the warrant agreement was also amended on july  under the terms of the amended note and warrant agreements  the maturity of the veritas note was extended from april  to july  and the expiration date for all warrants issued was extended until june  the annual interest rate was reduced from to  provided the entire note balance was paid in full by december  since the veritas note was not paid in full by december   the note bears interest at until paid in full  and is payable on each october and april until the principal is paid in full 
the company has accrued additional interest of  at the incremental rate for the period of october  through december  interest was required to be paid in warrants under the terms of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the warrant agreement until the company was in compliance with the net borrowing base formula as defined in the bank one credit facility  at which time interest will only be paid in cash 
since october   all interest payments have been made in cash 
under the amended veritas note  a principal payment of  was made on july   the effective date of the amendment  and another  payment was made in december the balance due veritas was million at december  with the entire balance classified as long term in the accompanying financial statements 
the veritas note requires that proceeds from the exercise of warrants issued to guardian and eagle be used to pay interest and principal on the amended veritas note until paid in full 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the guardian and eagle transactions in liquidity the company s primary ongoing source of liquidity is from cash generated from operations and from the company s use of available borrowing capacity under its credit facility 
during the course of the year  the amount outstanding under the credit facility will vary  as the company s approach is to borrow under the facility as needed to fund capital expenditures and pay down the balance when cash is available in order to reduce interest charges 
as of december   the company had a working capital deficit of million  primarily due to substantial drilling in the fourth quarter of and a pay down of the credit facility balance 
correspondingly  the credit facility balance outstanding at december   was million  compared to the company s new borrowing base on march   of million 
the company expects that it will utilize its operational cash flows for to meet its working capital requirements and fund its capital expenditures through a mix of operational funds and additional borrowings under the credit facility 
the company anticipates capital expenditures will be approximately million  net of savings associated with promoted and carried interests in wells to be drilled in the company is currently in discussions with prospective partners regarding these promotes and carries 
in the event these cannot be agreed to with the partners  the company may be required to incur additional capital expenditures or not participate in the drilling of wells 
capital expenditures will be used to fund drilling and development activities  processing of additional seismic data and leasehold acquisitions and extensions in the company s project areas 
the actual amounts of capital expenditures and number of wells drilled may differ significantly from such estimates 
actual capital expenditures for the year ended december  were approximately million 
despite the reduced capital expenditure budget  the company intends to drill the same number of gross wells as it did in the significant decrease in expenditures anticipated for is due to the above mentioned carries and promotes  and because the drilling activities for are in shallower  less expensive  lower risk wells 
the company s revenues  profitability  future growth and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital are highly dependent on prevailing prices of oil and natural gas 
the company cannot predict future oil and natural gas price movements with certainty 
a continuation of the significantly lower oil and gas prices experienced by the company in the fourth quarter of  as compared to historical averages  would likely have an adverse effect on the company s liquidity  financial condition and results of operations 
lower oil and natural gas prices also may reduce the amount of reserves that can be produced economically by the company 
the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience substantial working capital requirements primarily due to the company s exploration and development program and less than expected results from drilling activities 
in  the company will focus more of its efforts toward drilling item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued lower risk development wells and strategic reserve acquisitions with the objective of reversing the declining production trend and adding reserves 
while the company believes that cash flow from operations and the credit facility should allow the company to implement its present business strategy through  additional debt or equity financing may be required in the future to fund the company s growth  development and exploration program  and to satisfy its existing obligations 
the failure to obtain and exploit such capital resources could have a material adverse effect on the company  including further curtailment of its exploration and other activities 
future financing obligations the company s credit facility expires in january and the veritas note matures in july based upon the company s projected oil and gas reserves at the end of  the company believes it will have sufficient oil and gas reserves to support its borrowing base when the credit facility expires and the company intends to amend  extend or replace the credit facility with the same or alternative lender before it expires and the veritas note before it matures 
in the event the company is unable to amend  extend or replace the credit facility or veritas note  the company believes it would be able to fulfill these obligations through the use of available cash flows  the identification of additional sources for debt or equity financings  or the sale of interests in its oil and gas properties 
however  these expectations are dependent on several internal and external factors 
if these factors differ from management s expectations  they could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to meet future financing obligations and cause the company to further curtail its exploration and development activities 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements  except for the operating lease obligations presented below 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments summarized below are the contractual obligations and other commercial commitments of the company as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total and beyond long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations commitment expiration by period in thousands commercial commitments total and beyond bank one credit facility as of december   million was outstanding under the facility  which is included in the long term debt balance in the table above 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued risk management activities and derivative transactions the company uses a variety of financial derivative instruments derivatives to manage exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices 
to qualify for hedge accounting  derivatives must meet the following criteria i the item to be hedged exposes the company to price risk  and ii the derivative reduces that exposure and is designated as a hedge 
commodity price hedges the company periodically enters into certain derivatives for a portion of its oil and natural gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce the exposure to price fluctuations 
the company s hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of its production  provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices and limit potential gains from future increases in prices 
such hedging arrangements may expose the company to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances where production is less than expected  the company s customers fail to purchase contracted quantities of oil or natural gas or a sudden unexpected event materially impacts oil or natural gas prices 
for financial reporting purposes  gains and losses related to hedging are recognized as oil and natural gas revenues during the period the hedge transactions occur 
the company expects that the amount of hedge contracts that it has in place will vary from time to time 
for the years ended december    and  the company hedged   and of its oil and gas production  respectively  and as of december   the company had bcfe of open oil and natural gas contracts for the months of january through october if all of these open contracts had been settled as of december   the company would have received approximately million 
the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  amended by statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
and statement no 
 accounting for certain derivatives and certain hedging activities hereinafter collectively referred to as sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the adoption of sfas no 
critical accounting policies the results of operations  as presented above  are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the application of these principles often requires management to make certain judgments  assumptions  and estimates that may result in different financial presentations 
the company believes that certain accounting principles are critical in understanding its financial statements 
full cost method of accounting the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including any general and administrative costs that are directly attributable to the company s acquisition  exploration and development activities  are capitalized in a full cost pool as incurred 
the company records depletion of its full cost pool using the unit of production method 
sec regulation s x  rule requires companies reporting on a full cost basis to apply a ceiling test wherein the capitalized costs within the full cost pool  net of deferred income taxes  may not exceed the net present value of the company s proved oil and gas reserves plus the lower of cost or market of unproved properties 
any such excess costs should be charged against earnings 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods 
accordingly  actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates include depreciation  depletion and amortization of proved oil and natural gas properties 
oil and natural gas reserve estimates  which are the basis for unit of production depletion and the cost ceiling test  are inherently imprecise and are expected to change as future information becomes available 
new accounting standards in addition to the identified critical accounting policies discussed above  future results could be affected by a number of new accounting standards that recently have been issued 
sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 
 issued in july  requires that all business combinations initiated after june   be accounted for under the purchase method and the use of the pooling of interests method is no longer permitted 
the adoption of sfas no 
 effective july   will result in the company accounting for any future business combinations under the purchase method of accounting  but will not change the method of accounting used in previous business combinations 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 also issued in july  requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead by reviewed for impairment on an annual basis 
the company has no goodwill recorded as of december   so the company does not expect an impact from the adoption of this standard 
sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
 issued in august  requires adoption as of january  the standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which the obligation is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
the company is currently studying the effects of the new standard 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 issued in october  supersedes sfas no 
the accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale applies to all long lived assets  including discontinued operations  and replaces the provisions of apb opinion no 
for the disposal of segments of a business 
sfas no 
requires that those long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
sfas no 
must be adopted effective january   however  the company does not expect an impact from this adoption since it follows the full cost method of accounting which requires long lived oil and gas property costs to be tested for impairment based on its full cost ceiling refer to previously referenced critical accounting policies 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued effects of inflation and changes in price crude oil and natural gas commodity prices have been very volatile and unpredictable during the three year period ending december  the wide fluctuations that have occurred during the past three years have had a significant impact on the company s results of operations  cash flow  liquidity  and financial budgeting 
recent rates of inflation have had a minimal effect on the company 
environmental and other regulatory matters the company s business is subject to certain federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for  and the development  production and transportation of  oil and natural gas  as well as environmental and safety matters 
many of these laws and regulations have become more stringent in recent years  often imposing greater liability on a larger number of potentially responsible parties 
although the company believes it is in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  the requirements imposed thereby frequently change and become subject to interpretation  and the company is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on its operations 
any suspensions  terminations or inability to meet applicable bonding requirements could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
although significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to the company  compliance has not had a material adverse effect on the earnings or competitive position of the company 
future regulations may add to the cost of  or significantly limit  drilling activity 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of legal and environmental matters 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk information the market risk inherent in the company s derivatives is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices 
the prices of oil and natural gas are subject to fluctuations resulting from hanges in supply and demand 
to reduce price risk caused by the market fluctuations  the company s policy is to hedge through the use of derivatives future production 
because commodities covered by these derivatives are substantially the same commodities that the company sells in the physical market  no special correlation studies other than monitoring the degree of convergence between the derivative and cash markets are deemed necessary 
the changes in market value of these derivatives have a high correlation to the price changes of oil and natural gas 
a sensitivity analysis model was used to calculate the fair values of the company s derivatives rates in effect at december  the sensitivity analysis involved increasing or decreasing the forward rates by a hypothetical and calculating the resulting unfavorable change in the fair values of the derivatives 
the results of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  showed this type of change would not have a material impact on the fair value of the derivatives previously stated million at december   as discussed in the risk management activities and derivative transactions section above
