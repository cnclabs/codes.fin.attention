item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and item selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
general hastings entertainment is a leading multimedia entertainment retailer that combines the sale of books  music  software  periodicals  videocassettes  video games  dvds  used products including cds  dvds and video games  video game consoles and dvd players with the rental of videocassettes  video games  dvds  video game consoles and dvd players in a superstore and internet web site format 
as of january   we operated superstores averaging approximately  square feet in small to medium sized markets located in states  primarily in the western and midwestern united states 
each of the superstores is wholly owned by the company and operates under the name of hastings 
our operating strategy is to enhance our position as a multimedia entertainment retailer by expanding and remodeling existing superstores  opening new superstores in selected markets  and offering our products through our internet web site 
references herein to fiscal years are to the twelve month periods that end in january of the following calendar year 
for example  the twelve month period ended january  is referred to as fiscal critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant estimates and assumptions are reviewed and any required adjustments are recorded on a monthly basis 
lower of cost or market for merchandise inventory 
our merchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost or market 
as with any retailer  economic conditions  cyclical customer demand and changes in purchasing or distribution can affect the carrying value of inventory 
as circumstances warrant  we record lower of cost or market lcm inventory adjustments 
in some instances  these adjustments can have a material effect on the financial results of an annual or interim period 
in order to determine such adjustments  we evaluate the age  inventory turns and estimated fair value of merchandise inventory by product category and record any adjustment if estimated fair value is below cost 
through merchandising and an automated progressive markdown program  we quickly take the steps necessary to increase the sell off of slower moving merchandise to eliminate or lessen the effect of any lcm adjustment 
returns process 
in general  merchandise inventory owned by us is returnable based upon return agreements with our merchandise vendors 
we continually return merchandise to vendors based on  among other factors  current and projected sales trends  overstock situations  authorized return timelines or change in product offerings 
at the end of any reporting period  there is inventory that has been returned to vendors or in the process of being returned to vendors for which accruals are required 
these costs can include freight  valuation and quantity differences  and other fees charged by a vendor 
in order to appropriately match the costs associated with the return of merchandise with the process of returning the product  we utilize an allowance for cost of inventory returns the allowance 
to accrue for such costs and estimate the allowance  we utilize historical experience adjusted for significant estimated or contractual modifications 
certain adjustments to the allowance can have a material effect on the financial results of an annual or interim period 
in addition  we recognize that some portion of our inventory in superstores will eventually be returned to a vendor based on the factors mentioned above 
we accrue return costs for these future returns on the same basis as product being returned or in the process of being returned to a vendor 
we continually evaluate the returns process and initiate improvements as needed 
rental video cost amortization 
in late fiscal  we completed a series of direct revenue sharing agreements with major studios  the majority of which were amended in fiscals and  under which we acquired approximately of our rental video asset units during fiscal we anticipate that our involvement in revenue sharing agreements will be similar to that of fiscal year in future periods 
revenue sharing allows us to acquire rental video assets at a lower up front capital cost than traditional buying arrangements 
we then share with studios a percentage of the actual net rental revenues generated over a contractually determined period of time 
the increased access to additional copies of new releases under revenue sharing agreements will allow customer demand for new releases to be satisfied over a shorter period of time at a time when the new releases are most popular 
we expense revenue sharing payments as revenues are recognized under the terms of the specific contracts with supplying studios 
the capitalized cost of all rental video assets acquired for a fixed price is being amortized on an accelerated basis over six months to a salvage value of per unit  except for rental video assets purchased for the initial stock of a new superstore  which are being amortized on a straight line basis over months to a salvage value of certain events  including a downturn in the rental video industry  as a whole or the markets within which we operate our superstores  further consolidation of rental video retailers  substantial change in customer demand and change in the mix of rental video revenues  could effect the salvage value we have assigned to our rental video assets 
such effect could result in a material reduction of the carrying value of our rental video assets and have a material impact on the financial results of an annual or interim period 
in particular  the growth of the dvd market and the shift of consumer purchases from vhs videocassettes to dvd could result in a decrease in the salvage value of rental videos 
at some point during the rental cycle  a vhs item  as with dvd and games  is available for purchase by a customer as a previously viewed tape pvt 
our current experience is that the amount received for the pvt is significantly higher than our salvage value of that item in our rental inventory 
based in part on this factor and turns of pvt  we believe our estimate of salvage value is accurate 
store closing reserve 
as with any retailer  from time to time  and in the normal course of business  we evaluate our store base to determine if a need to close or relocate a store s is present 
management will evaluate  among other factors  current and future profitability  market trends  age of store and lease status 
upon the appropriate executive approval to close a location  we record charges related to the costs of store closings or relocations 
the primary expense items associated with these charges relate to the net present value of minimum lease payments the present value of remaining lease payments under an active lease and the write off of leasehold improvements and other assets not remaining in our possession at the time the location is closed or relocated 
the amount recorded can fluctuate based on the age of the closing location  term and remaining years of the lease and the number of stores being closed or relocated 
these charges can have a material effect on the financial results of an annual or interim period 
although we actively pursue sublease tenants on all closed or relocated locations  we do not record any estimated sublease income as an offset to any of charge until a sublease agreement is executed 
we evaluate all of our stores on a quarterly basis to ascertain any need for impairment of assets or to commence closing proceedings 
results of operations the following tables present our statement of operations data  expressed as a percentage of revenue  and the number of superstores open at the end of period for the three most recent fiscal years 
fiscal year merchandise revenue rental video revenue total revenues merchandise cost of revenue rental video cost of revenue total cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses pre opening expenses operating income loss other income expense interest expense other  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss fiscal year hastings superstores beginning number of stores openings closings ending number of stores excludes one additional superstore closed in february fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
total revenues for the fiscal year ending january  were million  up million  or  from million for the fiscal year ending january  primarily due to an increase in total comparable store revenue comps of for the year 
elements of total comps are as follows merchandise comps rental video comps total comps the comp increases in merchandise and rental were partially offset by the operation of three fewer superstores throughout fiscal compared to fiscal total merchandise revenues increased million  or for fiscal to million from million for fiscal the increase in merchandise comps was driven primarily by year over year increases of and in total sales of dvds and video games  respectively 
comp increases were partially offset by a decline in music comps of due primarily to the current malaise of the music industry  which overall experienced a decline of in total music shipments for book comps for the year increased slightly at 
total rental video revenues for fiscal increased million  or to million compared to million for the prior year primarily due to an increase in rentals of dvd titles of year over year 
gross profit 
for fiscal  total gross profit increased to million  or of total revenues  from  or of total revenues for fiscal merchandise gross profit for fiscal  as a percent of merchandise revenue  increased to compared to for fiscal due primarily to i a reduction in the costs associated with the return of product of approximately million for fiscal which is attributable to improvements made in the product return process during fiscal that lowered the cost per dollar of return  and ii lower product costs of approximately million as a result of a movement in our inventory selection toward higher margin products particularly related to books 
partially offsetting these increases in merchandise gross profit was an increase of approximately million in the costs of operating our distribution center 
during fiscal  we implemented a strategy to increase the flow of certain higher turning inventory items through our distribution center 
this program enables us to have a better in stock position for our customers 
for the year  the volume of shipments from our distribution center to our superstores increased approximately when compared to fiscal  which resulted in significantly higher operating costs 
rental video gross profit for fiscal  as a percent of rental video revenue  decreased to compared to for fiscal due primarily to i an increase of approximately million in depreciation expenses as we procured a higher level of video games and dvd to meet increasing demand 
a large portion of these purchases were for catalog rental product which exhibit slower turns than a new release title  and ii an increase of approximately million in costs associated with the distribution of rental videos primarily due to increased overhead costs as we processed a greater number of rental assets through our distribution center 
partially offsetting these decreases in rental video gross profit was an increase in margin of approximately million on the rental of revenue sharing titles due to improved terms on agreements with studios 
additionally  a higher percentage of non revenue sharing titles  which generally reflect higher margins  helped to offset the decreases listed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  including store and corporate labor and other overhead costs  for fiscal decreased to million  or of total revenues  from million  or of total revenues last year 
this substantial decrease was primarily the result of a higher level of expenses recorded during the prior year including i million in accounting and legal fees associated with the restatement of the first three quarters of fiscal and the prior four fiscal years 
these fees did not recur during fiscal  ii asset impairment charges of million comprised of million in writedowns of leasehold improvements included in three underperforming superstores and 
million in writedowns of certain assets of the company s internet segment were recorded during fiscal this compares to a million writedown of leasehold improvements for two underperforming superstores in fiscal although these superstores continued to operate  such charges were recorded as projected cash flows from these operations were not sufficient to realize the book value of the specific assets  and iii we recorded net expenses of million in fiscal associated with the closure of two superstores during the fourth quarter of fiscal and an additional four superstores approved for closure prior to year end of fiscal this compared to net expenses of million related to two underperforming superstores which were approved for closure during fiscal  one of which was closed during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the other closed in february such expenses are comprised of accruals for the net present value of future minimum lease payments  the write off of leasehold improvements  and other related costs 
partially offsetting the decreases in sg a expense listed above was an increase in net advertising costs of approximately million year over year 
the higher expense was the result of a planned increase in targeted advertising expenditures during fiscal to increase customer traffic 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses were million for fiscal  as we opened five superstores during the year 
for fiscal  pre opening expenses totaled  with the opening of one new superstore 
pre opening expenses include human resource costs  travel  rent  advertising  supplies and certain other costs incurred prior to a superstore s opening 
interest expense 
for the year  interest expense decreased to million  or of total revenues  from million  or of total revenues for last year 
this reduction was primarily due to lower interest rates as well as a lower average outstanding borrowing during the current year compared to last year 
income taxes 
income tax expense for the fiscal years and was zero and million  respectively 
no income tax expense was recorded related to income for fiscal due to the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance related to the net deferred tax asset established in the fourth quarter of fiscal net income loss 
we recorded net income of million  or per diluted share for fiscal year compared to a net loss of million or per share reported for fiscal year fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
total revenues for fiscal year increased to million from million for fiscal year the revenue growth consisted of a increase in merchandise revenues and a increase in rental video revenue and was primarily due to the number of new superstores opened in fiscal that were open for a full year during fiscal comps for fiscal were and are detailed as follows merchandise comps rental video comps total comps sale video  driven by sales of dvds  previously viewed videocassettes  and video games exhibited the largest percentage growth year over year with declines in music revenues  as a result of general weakness in the industry  and book revenues  as a result of inventory management issues 
gross profit 
total gross profit  as a percent of total revenue  declined from in fiscal to in fiscal as a result of a series of factors as follows i during the first quarter of fiscal  management determined a need to improve inventory turns in order to enhance cash flow  reduce markdown expense  and enhance our inventory offering 
our resulting implementation of an initiative to permanently improve inventory turns generated an increase in the volume of returns to vendors and markdowns as well as compressed the timing of these returns resulting in higher fees per return based on the pricing agreements with our vendors 
this negatively impacted gross profit by a million increase in the cost associated with the return of product  ii lower than anticipated sales volume for certain products in the first three quarters of fiscal resulted in management s decision to increase the markdown frequency on certain products to stimulate sales  increase inventory turnover and improve cash flows 
such retail price markdowns increased approximately million resulting in lower merchandise margins  iii margins were also adversely affected by an increase in freight costs of million for the year ended january  due to freight carriers adding fuel surcharges of to  and iv as circumstances warrant  due to changing market conditions or specific transactions  we record lower of cost or market inventory adjustments 
such inventory adjustments increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was primarily a result of our entering into a barter transaction with a third party during fiscal  for which we recorded an asset related to the barter credit in the amount of million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the barter company ceased operations and no longer appeared to be a going concern 
consequently  we deemed the entire credit to be fully impaired  which resulted in a charge to income of million in the third quarter of fiscal also contributing to the overall decrease in margin was a decline in rental video margin of approximately million primarily as a result of an increase in rental video revenue subject to revenue sharing agreements with studios as a percent of total rental video revenue  which has lower profit margins 
offsetting the declines in margin outlined above was a million decline in the amount of promotional coupons redeemed during fiscal over fiscal and a reduction in shrinkage of approximately million resulting from an increased focus on loss prevention 
in addition  we experienced an increase in discounts on product purchase prices due to more advantageous buying and improved seasonal terms from our vendors during the year 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses increased to million or of total revenues in fiscal from million or in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of million in accounting and legal fees associated with the restatement of the first three quarters of fiscal and the prior four fiscal years and collective asset impairment charges of million comprised of million in writedowns of leasehold improvements included in three underperforming superstores and 
million in writedowns of certain assets of the company s internet segment 
such charges were recorded as projected cash flows from these operations were not sufficient to realize the book value of the specific assets 
additionally  during fiscal  we recorded net expenses of million associated with the closure of two superstores during the fourth quarter and an additional four superstores approved for closure prior to year end 
such expenses are comprised of accruals for the net present value of future minimum lease payments  the write off of leasehold improvements  and other related costs 
during fiscal  we recorded expenses of million related to the closure of six superstores and one college bookstore 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses were  for the year ending january   as we opened one superstore during the year 
for the year ending january   pre opening expenses totaled million with the opening of new superstores 
pre opening expenses include human resource costs  travel  rent  advertising  supplies and certain other costs incurred prior to a superstore s opening 
interest expense 
despite a higher interest rate environment  our overall interest expense declined approximately million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal primarily due to a lower average balance of long term debt 
income taxes 
due to cumulative losses incurred in recent years  the current balance of the net deferred tax asset does not meet the criteria for recognition under sfas as a result  we fully reserved the balance of the net deferred tax asset of million 
we recorded income tax expense of million primarily as the result of the provision for the valuation allowance partially offset by the tax benefit derived from the loss generated in fiscal net loss 
for fiscal year  we incurred a net loss of million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share for fiscal liquidity and capital resources we generate cash from operations exclusively from the sale of merchandise and the rental of video products and we have substantial operating cash flow because most of our revenue is received in cash and cash equivalents 
other than our principal capital requirements arising from the purchase  warehousing and merchandising of inventory and rental videos  opening new superstores and expanding existing superstores and updating existing and implementing new information systems technology  we have no anticipated material capital commitments 
our primary sources of working capital are cash flow from operating activities  trade credit from vendors and borrowings under our revolving credit facility the facility 
we believe our cash flow from operations and borrowings under the facility will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations  new superstores and superstore expansions through fiscal consolidated cash flows operating activities 
net cash flows from operating activities decreased million  or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the most significant reason for the decrease was the difference in the change of inventory assets between the two fiscal years 
in fiscal  as part of our strategic plan  we decreased our merchandise inventory by approximately million 
approximately million of this decline was the result of our initiative to increase cash flow and inventory turns by reducing our inventory 
the remaining decrease in inventory was due to added controls on purchasing  markdown management and improved sell through 
during fiscal  we experienced an increase in inventory assets of approximately million  of which approximately million resulted from cash transactions 
the remainder was company owned rental inventory transferred to merchandise for sale as previously viewed product 
the increase in inventory was due primarily to the opening of five new superstores and the expansion of seven superstores 
additionally  we purchased and sold a higher level of dvd and video game product during fiscal contributing to the increase in inventory 
partially offsetting the change in inventory was an increase of million in net income loss as we recorded net income of million in fiscal compared to a net loss of million in fiscal and a positive difference in the change of trade accounts payable and other accrued expenses of million resulting primarily from increased purchases of inventory coupled with an increase in accounts payable days in fiscal compared to fiscal investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to the opening of five new superstores and the expansion of seven superstores during fiscal compared to the opening of one new superstore and the expansion of five superstores during fiscal additionally  purchases of rental video assets increased during fiscal due to new and expanded superstore activity and increased purchases of dvd and video games to meet customer demand 
our capital expenditures include store equipment and fixtures  expanding and remodeling existing superstores  upgrading and implementation of information systems technology and the purchase of rental video assets 
financing activities 
cash provided by or used in financing activities is primarily associated with borrowings and payments made under the facility 
cash provided by financing activities increased million to million in fiscal compared to cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal the primary reason for this increase was due to fiscal activity 
during fiscal  with an increase in cash flow from operations and decrease in capital expenditures  we decreased our overall debt balances by approximately million to million as of january  from million as of january   eliminating our term debt by paying off our senior notes and reducing the level of our revolving credit borrowings 
on september  we announced a stock repurchase program of up to million of our common stock 
as of january   a total of  shares had been purchased at a cost of approximately million  for an average cost of per share 
capital structure 
on august   we entered into a three year syndicated  secured loan and security agreement with fleet retail finance  inc and the cit group business credit  inc the initial proceeds from the facility were used to terminate and prepay fully the total amounts outstanding under our prior revolving credit facility with bank of america and a consortium of banks and our series a senior notes the senior notes with a financial institution 
the amount outstanding under the facility is limited by a borrowing base predicated on eligible inventory  as defined  and certain rental video assets  net of accumulated depreciation less specifically defined reserves and is limited to a ceiling of million  which increases to million between october and december of each year of the facility  less a million availability reserve 
the facility bears interest based on the prevailing prime rate or libor plus at our option 
the borrowing base under the facility is limited to an advance rate of of eligible inventory and certain rental video assets net of accumulated amortization less specifically defined reserves which could be adjusted to reduce availability under the facility 
the facility contains no financial covenants  restricts the payment of dividends and includes certain other debt and acquisition limitations  allows for the repurchase of up to million of our common stock and requires a minimum availability of million at all times 
the facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and our subsidiaries and is guaranteed by each of our three consolidated subsidiaries 
the facility expires on august  at january   we had million in excess availability  after the million availability reserve  under the facility 
at january  and  we had borrowings outstanding of million and million under the facility  respectively 
the average rate of interest being charged under the facility was and at january  and  respectively 
we entered into two interest rate swaps  one in november and one in december  with a financial institution in order to obtain a fixed interest rate on a portion of our outstanding floating rate debt thereby reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility 
the notional value of each swap is million of our revolving credit facility at fixed interest rates of and  respectively  for one year 
we have designated the interest rate swaps as hedging instruments 
at january   the fair value of the interest rate swaps was not significant 
seasonality and inflation as is the case with many retailers  a significant portion of our revenues  and an even greater portion of our operating profit  is generated in the fourth fiscal quarter  which includes the christmas selling season 
as a result  a substantial portion of our annual earnings has been  and will continue to be  dependent on the results of this quarter 
we experience reduced rentals of video activity in the spring because customers spend more time outdoors 
major world or sporting events  such as the super bowl  the olympic games or the world series  also have a temporary adverse effect on revenues 
future operating results may be affected by many factors  including variations in the number and timing of superstore openings  the number and popularity of new book  music and videocassette titles  the cost of the new release or best renter titles  changes in comparable store revenues  competition  marketing programs  increases in the minimum wage  weather  special or unusual events  and other factors that may affect our operations 
we do not believe that inflation has materially impacted net income during the past three years 
substantial increases in costs and expenses could have a significant impact on our operating results to the extent such increases are not passed along to customers 
recent accounting pronouncements in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which was amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting guidelines for derivatives and requires us to record all derivatives as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value 
our use of derivatives is limited to interest rate swaps which we have designated as hedging instruments 
at january   the fair value of the interest rate swaps was not significant  and therefore  the adoption of sfas no 
has not had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets or our statements of operations  shareholders equity and cash flows 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal we will test goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in statement the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
prior to july   we expect to perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill based on its carrying value at january  any impairment charge resulting from these transitional tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal we have not yet determined what the effect of these tests will be  however  application of the statements is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations for a disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted sfas as of february  and such adoption did not have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of our business  we are exposed to certain market risks  primarily changes in interest rates 
our exposure to interest rate risk consists of variable rate debt based on the lenders base rate or libor plus a specified percentage at our option 
the annual impact on our results of operations of a basis point interest rate change on the january  outstanding balance of the variable rate debt would be approximately million 
after an assessment of these risks to our operations  we believe that the primary market risk exposures within the meaning of regulation s k item are not material and are not expected to have any material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows for the next fiscal year 
in addition  we do not believe changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps entered into in november and december with notional amounts of million each will be material
