federal  state and local taxation federal taxation general 
the following is a discussion of material tax matters and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the company 
the bank was last audited by the internal revenue service irs for its taxable year ended december  for federal income tax purposes  the company files consolidated income tax returns on a june fiscal year basis using the accrual method of accounting and will be subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions  including particularly the bank s tax reserve for bad debts  discussed below 
tax bad debt reserves 
the bank  as a large bank under irs classifications ie  one with assets having an adjusted basis of more than million  is unable to make additions to its tax bad debt reserve  is permitted to deduct bad debts only as they occur and is required to recapture ie  take into income  over a multi year period  a portion of the balance of its bad debt reserves as of june  since the bank has already provided a deferred income tax liability for this tax for financial reporting purposes  there was no adverse impact to the bank s financial condition or results of operations from the enactment of the federal legislation that imposed such recapture 
the recapture was suspended during the tax years ended june  and  based upon the bank s origination levels for certain residenti al loans which satisfied the minimum levels required by the small business job protection act of to suspend recapture for those tax years 
distributions 
to the extent that the bank makes non dividend distributions to shareholders  such distributions are considered distributions from the bank s base year reserve ie  its reserve as of december   to the extent thereof  and then from its supplemental reserve for losses on loans 
an amount based on the amount distributed will be included in the bank s taxable income in the year of distribution 
non dividend distributions include distributions in excess of the bank s current and accumulated earnings and profits  as calculated for federal income tax purposes  distributions in redemption of stock  and distributions in partial or complete liquidation 
dividends paid out of the bank s current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be so included in the bank s income 
the amount of additional taxable income created from a non dividend distribution is an amount that  when reduced by the tax attributable to the income  is equal to the amount of the distribution 
thus  approximately one and one half times the amount of such distribution but not in excess of the amount of such reserves would be includable in income for federal income tax purposes  assuming a federal corporate income tax rate 
see regulation regulation of federal savings associations limitation on capital distributions for limits on the payment of dividends by the bank 
the bank does not intend to pay dividends that would result in a recapture of any portion of its tax bad debt reserves 
corporate alternative minimum tax 
the internal revenue code of  as amended the code imposes a tax amt on alternative minimum taxable income amti at a rate of 
amti is adjusted by determining the tax treatment of certain items in a manner that negates the deferral of income resulting from the customary tax treatment of those items 
thus  the bank s amti is increased by of the amount by which the bank s adjusted current earnings exceed its amti determined without regard to this adjustment and prior to reduction for net operating losses 
state and local taxation state of new york 
the company is subject to new york state nys franchise tax on one of several alternative bases  whichever results in the highest tax  and files combined returns for purposes of this tax 
the basic tax is measured by entire net income  which is federal taxable income with adjustments 
for nys tax purposes  as long as the bank continues to satisfy certain definitional tests relating to its assets and the nature of its business  it will be permitted deductions  within specified formula limits  for additions to its bad debt reserves for purposes of computing its entire net income 
the bank s deduction with respect to qualifying loans  which are generally loans secured by certain interests in real property  may be computed using an amount based on the bank s actual loss experience the exper ience method or of the bank s entire net income  computed without regard to this deduction and reduced by the amount of any permitted addition to the bank s reserve for non qualifying loans 
nys enacted legislation which enables the bank to avoid the recapture into income of nys tax bad debt reserves unless one of the following events occurs the bank s retained earnings represented by the reserve are used for purposes other than to absorb losses from bad debts  including dividends in excess of the bank s earnings and profits or distributions in liquidation or in redemption of stock  the bank fails to qualify as a thrift as provided by nys tax law  or there is a change in nys tax law 
the bank s deduction with respect to non qualifying loans must be computed pursuant to the experience method which is based on the bank s actual charge offs 
each year the bank will review the most favorable method of calculating the deduction attributable to an addition to the tax bad debt reserves 
the nys tax rate for the fiscal year ended june  was including a commuter transportation surcharge of net income 
in general  the holding company is not required to pay nys tax on dividends and interest received from the bank 
city of new york 
the holding company and the bank are also both subject to a new york city banking corporation tax of on taxable income allocated to new york city 
new york city additionally enacted legislation which conformed its tax law regarding bad debt deductions to nys tax law 
state of delaware 
as a delaware holding company not earning income in delaware  the holding company is exempted from delaware corporate income tax  but is required to file an annual report and pay an annual franchise tax to the state of delaware 
regulation general the bank is subject to extensive regulation  examination  and supervision by the ots  as its chartering agency  and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  as its deposit insurer 
the bank s deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif  which are administered by the fdic 
the bank must file reports with the ots concerning its activities and financial condition  and must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions  such as mergers with  or acquisitions of  other depository institutions 
the ots conducts periodic examinations to assess the bank s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements 
this regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a savings association may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors 
as a publicly held unitary savings and loan holding company  the holding company is required to file certain reports  and otherwise comply  with the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission the sec under the federal securities laws and of the ots 
the ots and the fdic have significant discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies  including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
any change in such policies  whether by the ots  the fdic or the united states congress  could have a material adverse impact on the operations of the company 
the following discussion is intended to be a summary of the material statutes and regulations applicable to savings associations and savings and loan holding companies  and it does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all such statutes and regulations 
regulation of federal savings associations business activities 
the bank derives its lending and investment powers from the home owner s loan act  as amended hola  and the regulations of the ots enacted thereunder 
under these laws and regulations  the bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate  commercial and consumer loans  certain types of debt securities  and certain other assets 
the bank may also establish service corporations that may engage in activities not otherwise permissible for the bank  including certain real estate equity investments and securities and insurance brokerage 
these investment powers are subject to various limitations  including a a prohibition against the acquisition of any corporate debt security not rated in one of the four highest rating categories  b a limit of of capital on the aggregate amount of loans secured by commercial property  c a limit of of assets on commercial loans  with the amount of commercial loans in excess of of assets being limited to small business loans  d a limit of of assets on the aggregate amount of consumer loans and acquisitions of certain debt securities  e a limit of of assets on non conforming loans ie  loans in excess of the specific limitations of hola  and f a limit of the greater of of assets or capital on certain construction loans made for the purpose of financing property which is  or is expected to become  residential 
loans to one borrower 
under hola  savings associations are generally subject to the same limits on loans to one borrower as are imposed on national banks 
generally  under these limits  a savings association may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of of the association s unimpaired capital and surplus 
additional amounts may be lent  not in excess of of unimpaired capital and surplus  if such loans or extensions of credit are fully secured by readily marketable collateral 
such collateral is defined to include certain debt and equity securities and bullion  but generally does not include real estate 
at june   the bank s limit on loans to one borrower was million 
at june   the bank s largest aggregate amount of loans to one borrower was mi llion and the second largest borrower had an aggregate balance of million 
qtl test 
hola requires a savings association to satisfy a qtl test 
a savings association may satisfy the qtl test by maintaining at least of its portfolio assets in certain qualified thrift investments during at least nine months of the most recent twelve month period 
portfolio assets means  in general  an association s total assets less the sum of a specified liquid assets up to of total assets  b certain intangibles  including goodwill  credit card relationships and purchased mortgage servicing rights  and c the value of property used to conduct the association s business 
qualified thrift investments include various types of loans made for residential and housing purposes  investments related to such purposes  including certain mortgage backed and related securities  small business loans  education loans  and credit card loans 
a savings association may additionally satisfy the qtl test by qualifying as a domestic building and loan association as defined in the code 
at june   the bank maintained of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments 
the bank also satisfied the qtl test in each of the prior months and  therefore  was a qtl 
a savings association that fails the qtl test must either operate under certain restrictions on its activities or convert to a bank charter 
the initial restrictions include prohibitions against a engaging in any new activity not permissible for a national bank  b paying dividends not permissible under national bank regulations  c obtaining new advances from the fhlbny  and d establishing any new branch office in a location not permissible for a national bank in the association s home state 
in addition  within one year of the date a savings association ceases to satisfy the qtl test  any company controlling the association must register under  and become subject to the requirements of  the bank holding company act of  as amended 
a savings association that has failed the qtl test may requalify under the qtl test and be free of such l imitations  however  may do so only once 
if the savings association does not requalify under the qtl test within three years after failing the qtl test  it would be required to terminate any activity and dispose of any investment not permissible for a national bank and repay as promptly as possible any outstanding advances from the fhlbny 
capital requirements 
ots regulations require savings associations to satisfy three minimum capital standards a tangible capital ratio of of total assets as adjusted under ots regulations  a risk based capital ratio of of risk based capital as defined under ots regulations to total risk based assets also as defined under ots regulations  and a leverage capital ratio as defined under ots regulations 
for a depository institution that has been assigned the highest composite rating of under the uniform financial institutions rating  the minimum leverage capital required ratio is 
for any other depository institution  the minimum leverage capital required ratio is  unless a higher leverage capital ratio is warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of the depository institution 
nbs p  in determining the amount of risk based assets for purposes of the risk based capital requirement  a savings association must compute its risk based assets by multiplying its assets and certain off balance sheet items by risk weights  which range from for cash and obligations issued by the united states government or its agencies  to for consumer and commercial loans  as assigned by the ots capital regulations based on the risks the ots believes are inherent in the type of asset 
tangible capital is defined  generally  as common stockholders equity including retained earnings  certain non cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related earnings  and minority interests in equity accounts of fully consolidated subsidiaries  less intangibles other than certain purchased mortgage servicing rights and investments in  and loans to  subsidiaries engaged in activities not permissible for a national bank 
core capital is defined similarly to tangible capital  however  additionally includes  among other items  certain qualifying supervisory goodwill and certain purchased credit card relationships 
supplementary capital includes cumulative preferred stock  long term perpetual preferred stock  mandatory convertible securities  subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock  and the allowance for possible loan losses 
the ots and other federal banking regulators adopted  effective october   an amendment to their risk based capital guidelines that permits insured depository institutions to include in supplementary capital up to of the pretax net unrealized holding gains on certain available for sale equity securities  as such gains are computed under the guidelines 
the allowance for loan and lease losses includable in supplementary capital is limited to a maximum of of risk based assets  and the amount of supplementary capital that may be included as total capital cannot exceed the amount of core capital 
on may   the ots adopted amendments to its capital regulations which  among other matters  eliminated the interest rate risk component of the risk based capital requirement 
pursuant to the amendment  the ots will continue to monitor the interest rate risk management of individual institutions through the ots requirements for interest rate risk management  the ability of the ots to impose an individual minimum capital requirement on institutions that exhibit a high degree of interest rate risk  and the requirements of thrift bulletin a  which provides guidance regarding the management of interest rate risk and the responsibility of boards of directors in that area 
the table below presents the bank s regulatory capital as compared to the ots regulatory capital requirements at june  a s of june  minimum capital actual requirement amount ratio amount ratio dollars in thousands tangible leverage capital risk based capital the following is a reconciliation of gaap capital to regulatory capital for the bank at june  tangible capital leverage capital risk based capital dollars in thousands gaap capital non allowable assets accumulated other comprehensive income goodwill core deposit intangible general valuation allowance regulatory capital minimum capital requirement regulatory capital excess limitation on capital distributions 
ots regulations currently impose limitations upon capital distributions by savings associations  such as cash dividends  payments to purchase or otherwise acquire its shares  payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash out merger  and other distributions charged against capital 
as the subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company  the bank is required to file a notice with the ots at least days prior to each capital distribution 
however  if the total amount of all capital distributions including each proposed capital distribution for the applicable calendar year exceeds net income for that year plus the retained net income for the preceding two years  then the bank must file an application for ots approval of a proposed capital distribution 
in addition  the ots can prohibit a proposed capital distribution otherwise permissible under the regulation  if it has determined that the association is in need of more than customary supervision or that a proposed distribution by an association would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
furthermore  under the ots prompt corrective action regulations  the bank w ould be prohibited from making any capital distribution if  after the distribution  the bank failed to satisfy its minimum capital requirements  as described above see regulation regulation of federal savings associations prompt corrective regulatory action 
in addition  pursuant to the federal deposit insurance act fdia  an insured depository institution such as the bank is prohibited from making capital distributions  including the payment of dividends  if  after making such distribution  the institution would become undercapitalized as defined in the fdia 
liquidity 
pursuant to ots regulations  the bank is required to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operation see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  for further discussion 
assessments 
savings associations are required by ots regulation to pay semi annual assessments to the ots to fund its operations 
the regulations base the assessment for individual savings associations  other than those with total assets never exceeding million  on three components the size of the association on which the basic assessment is based  the association s supervisory condition  which results in percentage increases for any savings institution with a composite rating of  or in its most recent safety and soundness examination  and the complexity of the association s operations  which results in percentage increases for a savings association that managed over billion in trust assets  serviced loans for other institutions aggregating more than billion  or had certain off balance sheet assets aggregati ng more than billion 
branching 
subject to certain limitations  hola and ots regulations permit federally chartered savings associations to establish branches in any state of the united states 
the authority to establish such a branch is available a in states that expressly authorize branches of savings associations located in another state and b to an association that either satisfies the qtl test or qualifies as a domestic building and loan association under the code  which imposes qualification requirements similar to those for a qtl under hola see regulation regulation of federal savings associations qtl test 
this authority under hola and the ots regulations preempts any state law purporting to regulate branching by federal savings associations 
community reinvestment 
under the community reinvestment act cra  as implemented by ots regulations  a savings association possess a continuing and affirmative obligation  consistent with its safe and sound operation  to help satisfy the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services it believes are best suited to its particular community 
the cra requires the ots  in connection with its examination of a savings association  to assess the association s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and consider such record in its evaluation of certain applications by such association 
t he assessment focuses on three tests a a lending test  to evaluate the institution s record of making loans in its service areas  b an investment test  to evaluate the institution s record of investing in community development projects  affordable housing  and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses  and c a service test  to evaluate the institution s delivery of services through its branches  automated teller machines atms and other offices 
the cra also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their cra ratings 
the bank received an outstanding cra performance rating and an outstanding cra compliance rating in its most recent examination 
regulations implementing the requirements under the gramm leach bliley act of gramm leach that insured depository institutions publicly disclose certain agreements that are in fulfillment of the cra became effective april  the bank has no such agreements in place at this time 
transactions with related parties 
the bank s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by ots regulations and sections a and b of the federal reserve act fra 
in general  an affiliate of the bank is any company that controls the bank or any other company that is controlled by a company that controls the bank  excluding the bank s subsidiaries other than those that are insured depository institutions 
a subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution is generally not treated as an affiliate of the bank for purposes of sections a and b  however the federal reserve bank has proposed treating any subsidiary of a bank that is engaged in activities not permissible for bank holding companies under the bank holding company act bhc act as an affiliate for purposes o f sections a and b 
ots regulations prohibit a savings association a from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies under section c of the bhc act and b from purchasing the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary 
section a limits the aggregate amount of transactions with any individual affiliate to of the capital and surplus of the savings association and also limits the aggregate amount of transactions with all affiliates to of the savings association s capital and surplus 
extensions of credit to affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type described in section a  and the purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited 
section b provides that certain transactions with affiliates  including loans and asset purchases  must be on terms and under circumstances  including credit standards  that are substantially the same or at least as fa vorable to the association as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies 
in the absence of comparable transactions  such transactions may only occur under terms and circumstances  including credit standards  that in good faith would be offered  or would apply  to nonaffiliated companies 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley prohibits the extension of personal loans to directors and executive officers of issuers as defined in sarbanes oxley 
the prohibition  however  does not apply to mortgages advanced by an insured depository institution  such as the bank  that are subject to the insider lending restrictions of section h of the fra 
the bank s authority to extend credit to its directors  executive officers  and shareholders owning or more of the holding company s outstanding common stock  as well as to entities controlled by such persons  is additionally governed by the requirements of sections g and h of the fra and regulation o of the federal reserve board frb thereunder 
among other matters  these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders a be made on terms that are substantially the same as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than  those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and b not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons  individually and in t he aggregate  which limits are based  in part  on the amount of the association s capital 
in addition  extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the association s board of directors 
enforcement 
under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  the ots possesses primary enforcement responsibility over federally chartered savings associations and has the authority to bring enforcement action against all institution affiliated parties  including any controlling stockholder or any shareholder  attorney  appraiser or accountant who knowingly or recklessly participates in any violation of applicable law or regulation  breach of fiduciary duty or certain other wrongful actions that cause  or are likely to cause  more than minimal loss or other significant adverse effect on an insured savings association 
civil penalties cover a wide series of violations and actions and range from  for each day during which violations of law  regulations  orders  and certain written agreements and conditions continue  up to million per day for such violations if the person obtained a substantial pecuniary gain as a result of such violation or knowingly or recklessly caused a substantial loss to the institution 
criminal penalties for certain financial institution crimes include fines of up to million and imprisonment for up to years 
in addition  regulators possess substantial discretion to take enforcement action against an institution that fails to comply with regulatory structure  particularly with respect to capital requirements 
possible enforcement actions range from the imposition of a capital plan and capital directive to receivership  conservatorship  or the termination of deposit insurance 
under fdicia  the fdic has the authority to recommend to the director of the ots that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings association 
if action is not taken by the director  the fdic possesses authority to take such action under certain circumstances 
standards for safety and soundness 
pursuant to fdicia  as amended by the riegle community development and regulatory improvement act of  the ots  together with the other federal bank regulatory agencies  have adopted a set of guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards relating to internal controls and information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate risk exposure  asset growth  asset quality  earnings and compensation  fees and benefits 
in general  the guidelines require  among other features  appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines 
the guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or dispro portionate to the services performed by an executive officer  employee  director or principal shareholder 
in addition  the ots adopted regulations pursuant to fdicia that authorize  but do not require  the ots to order an institution that has been given notice by the ots that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan 
if  after being so notified  an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan  the ots must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized association is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia see regulation regulation of savings associations prompt corrective regulatory action 
if an institution fails to comply with such an order  the ots may seek enforcement in judicial proceedings and the imposit ion of civil money penalties 
real estate lending standards 
the ots and the other federal banking agencies adopted regulations to prescribe standards for extensions of credit that are a secured by real estate or b made for the purpose of financing the construction of improvements on real estate 
the regulations require each savings association to establish and maintain written internal real estate lending standards that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices and appropriate to the size of the association and the nature and scope of its real estate lending activities 
the standards must additionally conform to accompanying ots guidelines  which include loan to value ratios for the different types of real estate loans 
associations are also permitted to make a limited amount of loans that do not conform to the loan to value limitations provi ded such exceptions are reviewed and justified appropriately 
the guidelines additionally list a number of lending situations in which exceptions to the loan to value standards are permitted 
prompt corrective regulatory action 
under the ots prompt corrective action regulations  the ots is required to take certain  and authorized to take other  supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings associations 
for this purpose  a savings association is placed in one of five categories based on the association s capital 
generally  a savings association is considered well capitalized if it maintains all of the following capital ratios total capital to risk based assets of at least  core capital to risk based assets of at least  and core capital to adjusted total assets of at least 
in addition  in order to be considered well capitalized  the savings association cannot be subject to any order or directive of the ots to satisfy or maintain specific capital levels 
a savings association is considered adequately capitalized if it maintains all of the following capital ratios total capital to risk based assets of at least  core capital to risk based assets of at least  and core capital to adjusted total assets of at least or at least if the association receives the highest possible overall rating on its most recent safety and soundness examination by the ots 
a savings association is considered undercapitalized if it maintains any of the following capital ratios total capital to total risk based assets of less than  core capital to risk based assets of less than  or core capital to adjusted total assets of less than or of less than if the association receives the highest possible overall rating on its most recent safety and soundness examination by the ots 
a savings association is considered significantly undercapitalized if it maintains any of the fo llowing capital ratios total capital to risk based assets of less than  core capital to risk based assets of less than  or core capital to adjusted total assets of less than 
a savings association that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than is deemed to be critically undercapitalized 
the elements of an association s capital for purposes of the prompt corrective action regulations are defined generally as they are under the regulations for minimum capital requirements see regulation regulation of savings associations capital requirements 
as of june   the bank satisfied all criteria necessary to be categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
the severity of the action authorized or required to be taken under the prompt corrective action regulations increases as an association s capital deteriorates within the three undercapitalized categories 
all associations are prohibited from paying dividends  other capital distributions or management fees to any controlling person if  following such distribution  the association would be undercapitalized 
an undercapitalized association is required to file a capital restoration plan within days of the date the association receives notice that it is within any of the three undercapitalized categories 
the ots is required to monitor closely the condition of an undercapitalized association and to restrict the asset growth  acquisitions  branching  and new lines of business of such an association 
significantly undercapitalized associations are subject to restrictions on compensation of senior executive officers 
such an association may not  without ots consent  pay any bonus or provide compensation to any senior executive officer at a rate exceeding the officer s average rate of compensation excluding bonuses  stock options and profit sharing during the months preceding the month the association became undercapitalized 
a significantly undercapitalized association may also be subject  among other actions  to forced changes in the composition of its board of directors or senior management  additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates  restrictions on acceptance of deposits from correspondent associations  further restrictions on asset growth  restrictions on rates paid on deposits  forced termination or reduction of activities deemed risky  and any further operational restrictions deemed necessary by the ots 
if one or more grounds exist for appointing a conservator or receiver for an association  the ots may require the association to issue additional debt or stock  sell assets  be acquired by a depository association holding company or combine with another depository association 
the ots and fdic possess a broad range of justifications pursuant to which they may appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured depository association 
under fdicia  the ots is required to appoint a receiver or with the concurrence of the fdic  a conservator for a critically undercapitalized association within days after the association becomes critically undercapitalized or  with the concurrence of the fdic  to take such other action that would better achieve the purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions 
such alternative action can be renewed for successive day periods 
however  if the association continues to be critically undercapitalized on average during the quarter that begins days after it initially became critically undercapitalized  a receiver must be appointed  unless the ots makes certain findings with which the fdic concurs and the director of the ots and the chairman of the fdic certify that the association is viable 
in addition  an association that is critically undercapitalized is subject to more severe restrictions on its activities  and is prohibited  without prior approval of the fdic from  among other actions  entering into certain material transactions or paying interest on new or renewed liabilities at a rate that would significantly increase the association s weighted average cost of funds 
when appropriate  the ots can require corrective action by a savings association holding company under the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia 
insurance of deposit accounts 
savings associations are subject to a risk based assessment system for determining the amount of deposit insurance premium they will be required to pay 
under the risk based assessment system  which began in  the fdic assigns an institution to one of three capital categories based on the institution s financial information as of its most recent quarterly financial report filed with the applicable bank regulatory agency prior to the commencement of the assessment period 
the three capital categories consist of a well capitalized  b adequately capitalized  or c undercapitalized 
the fdic also assigns an institution to one of the three supervisory subcategories within each capital group 
the supervisory subgroup to which an institution is assigned is based upon an evaluation pro vided to the fdic by the institution s primary federal regulator and information that the fdic determines to be relevant to the institution s financial condition and the risk posed to the deposit insurance funds 
an institution s assessment rate depends on the capital category and supervisory sub category to which it is assigned 
under the regulations  there are nine assessment risk classifications ie  combinations of capital groups and supervisory subgroups to which different assessment rates are applied 
assessment rates currently range from of deposits for an institution in the highest category ie  well capitalized and financially sound  with no more than a few minor weaknesses to of deposits for an institution in the lowest category ie  undercapitalized and substantial supervisory concern 
the fdic is authorized to raise the assessment rates as necessary to maintain the required reserve ratio of of assessable deposits 
both the bif and saif curre ntly satisfy the reserve ratio requirement 
if the fdic determines that assessment rates should be increased  institutions in all risk categories could be affected 
the fdic has exercised this authority several times in the past and could raise insurance assessment rates in the future 
the fdic has recently alerted institutions to the possibility of higher deposit insurance premiums in early the fdic stated that  if necessary  the increased premiums would likely affect only institutions with bif insured deposits and would not exceed basis points 
while increases in deposit insurance premiums could have an adverse effect on the company s earnings  the recent advisory statement from the fdic  if enacted  is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings 
the deposit insurance funds act of amended the fdia to recapitalize the saif and expand the assessment base for the payments of financing corporation fico bonds 
fico bonds were sold by the federal government in order to finance the recapitalization of saif and bif insurance funds 
the recapitalization of the saif and bif insurance funds was necessitated following payments made from these insurance funds to compensate depositors of federally insured depository institutions that experienced bankruptcy and dissolution during the s and s 
the quarterly adjusted rate of assessment for fico bonds is for both bif and saif insured institutions 
privacy and security protection 
the ots has adopted regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of gramm leach 
the regulations  which require financial institutions to adopt procedures to protect customers and customers non public personal information  became effective november  the regulations require the bank to disclose its privacy policy  including identifying with whom it shares non public personal information  to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter 
in addition  the bank is required to provide its customers the ability to opt out of the sharing of their personal information with unaffiliated third parties 
the bank s existing privacy protection policy complies with the regulations 
implementa tion of the regulations did not have a material impact on the business  financial condition or results of operations of the company 
effective july   the ots and other federal banking agencies adopted guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information to implement certain provisions of gramm leach 
the guidelines describe the agencies expectations for the creation  implementation and maintenance of an information security program  including administrative  technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities 
the standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to insure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information  protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial customer harm or in convenience 
the bank has implemented these guidelines 
such implementation did not have a material impact on the business  financial condition or results of operations of the company 
gramm leach additionally permits each state to enact legislation that is more protective of consumers personal information 
currently there are a number of privacy bills pending in the new york legislature 
no action has been taken on any of these bills  and management of the company cannot predict the impact  if any  these bills will have  if enacted 
internet banking 
technological developments are dramatically altering the methods by which most companies  including financial institutions  conduct their business 
the growth of the internet is prompting banks to reconsider business strategies and adopt alternative distribution and marketing systems 
the federal bank regulatory agencies have conducted seminars and published materials targeted at various aspects of internet banking and have indicated their intention to re evaluate their regulations to ensure they encourage bank efficiency and competitiveness consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
the company cannot assure that federal bank regulatory agencies will not adopt new regulations that will not materially affect or restrict the bank s internet operations 
insurance activities 
as a federal savings bank  the bank is generally permitted to engage in certain insurance activities through subsidiaries 
effective october   ots regulations promulgated pursuant to gramm leach prohibited depository institutions from conditioning the extension of credit to individuals upon either the purchase of an insurance product or annuity or an agreement by the consumer not to purchase an insurance product or annuity from an entity not affiliated with the depository institution 
the regulations additionally require prior disclosure of this prohibition to potential insurance product or annuity customers 
implementation of these regulations did not have a material impact upon the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
federal home loan bank system 
the bank is a member of the fhlbny  which is one of the regional federal home loan banks fhlb composing the fhlb system 
each fhlb provides a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions 
the bank  as a member of the fhlbny  is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the fhlbny in an amount at least equal to the greater of i of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans and similar obligations at the beginning of each year  ii of assets  or iii one twentieth 

of its advances from the fhlbny 
at june   the bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in fhlbny stock of million 
the fhlbny paid dividends on its capital stock to the bank of million during the fiscal year ended june   million during the fiscal year ended june   and million during the fiscal year ended june  if such dividends were reduced  or interest on future fhlbny advances increased  it is probable that the bank s net interest income would also be reduced 
any advances from the fhlbny must be secured by specified types of collateral  and long term advances may be obtained only for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance 
federal reserve system 
the bank is subject to provisions of the fra and frb regulations pursuant to which depository institutions may be required to maintain non interest earning reserves against their deposit accounts and certain other liabilities 
currently  reserves must be maintained against transaction accounts primarily now and regular checking accounts 
frb regulations generally require that reserves be maintained in the amount of of the aggregate of transaction accounts up to million 
aggregate transaction accounts in excess of million are currently subject to a reserve ratio of  which the frb may adjust between and 
the frb regulations currently exempt the first million of otherwise reservable balances from the reserve requirements  which exemption is adjusted by the frb at the en d of each year 
the bank is in compliance with the foregoing reserve requirements 
because required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash  a non interest bearing account at a frb  or a pass through account as defined by the frb  the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the bank s interest earning assets 
the balances maintained to satisfy the frb reserve requirements may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements imposed by the ots 
fhlb members are additionally authorized to borrow from the federal reserve discount window  however frb regulations require such institutions to exhaust all fhlb sources prior to borrowing from a frb 
anti terrorism regulation 
the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of usa patriot act was signed into law on october   providing the federal government with new powers to address terrorist threats 
by way of amendments to the bank secrecy act  title iii of the usa patriot act enacts measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory and law enforcement agencies 
in addition  certain provisions of title iii impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions  including banks and thrifts 
title iii imposes the following requirements  among others  with respect to financial institutions pursuant to section  financial institutions must establish anti money laundering programs that include  at a minimum  internal policies  procedures and controls as well as an independent audit function to test the programs

bank regulators are directed to consider the effectiveness of a holding company in combating money laundering when ruling upon federal reserve act and bank merger act applications 
the federal banking agencies have begun to propose and implement regulations requiring financial institutions to adopt the policies and procedures contemplated by the usa patriot act 
implementation of the usa patriot act did not have a material impact upon the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
regulation of holding company the holding company is a non diversified unitary savings and loan holding company within the meaning of hola 
as such  it is required to register with the ots and is subject to ots regulations  examinations  supervision and reporting requirements 
in addition  the ots has enforcement authority over the holding company s non savings association subsidiaries 
among other effects  this authority permits the ots to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness  or stability of a subsidiary savings association 
hola prohibits a savings association holding company  directly or indirectly  or through one or more subsidiaries  from acquiring another savings association or holding company thereof  without prior written approval of the ots  acquiring or retaining  with certain exceptions  more than of a non subsidiary savings association  a non subsidiary holding company  or a non subsidiary company engaged in activities other than those permitted by hola  or acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not insured by the fdic 
in evaluating an application by a holding company to acquire a savings association  the ots must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and savings association involved  the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance funds  the convenience and needs of the comm unity  and competitive factors 
as a unitary savings and loan holding company  the holding company generally is not restricted under existing laws as to the types of business activities in which it may engage  provided that the bank continues to satisfy the qtl test see regulation regulation of federal savings associations qtl test for a discussion of the qtl requirements 
upon any non supervisory acquisition by the holding company of another savings association or a savings bank that satisfies the qtl test and is deemed to be a savings association by the ots and that will be held as a separate subsidiary  the holding company will become a multiple savings association holding company and will be subject to limitations on the types of business activities in which it can engage 
hola limits the activities of a multiple savings association holding company and its no n insured association subsidiaries primarily to activities permissible for bank holding companies under section c of the bhc act  subject to prior approval of the ots  and to other activities authorized by ots regulation 
the ots is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings association holding company controlling savings associations in more than one state  subject to two exceptions an acquisition of a savings association in another state a in a supervisory transaction  and b pursuant to authority under the laws of the state of the association to be acquired that specifically permit such acquisitions 
the conditions imposed upon interstate acquisitions by those states that have enacted authorizing legislation vary 
gramm leach also restricts the powers of new unitary savings and loan association holding companies

the net interest margin represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
in calculating these ratios  amortization expense related to goodwill and the core deposit intangible is excluded from non interest expense

the reconciliation of gaap earnings and cash earnings is as follows fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands net income additions to net income goodwill and core deposit intangible amortization non cash stock benefit plan expense cash earnings item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the holding company s primary business is the operation of the bank 
the company s consolidated results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the bank additionally generates non interest income such as service charges and other fees and income associated with the bank s purchase of bank owned life insurance boli 
non interest expenses primarily consist of employee compensation and benefits  federal deposit insurance premiums  data processing fees  marketing expenses and other operating expenses 
the company s consolidated results of operations are also significantly affected by genera l economic and competitive conditions particularly fluctuations in market interest rates  government policies  changes in accounting standards and actions of regulatory agencies 
management strategy the bank s primary strategy is to increase its household and deposit market shares in the communities that it serves  either through direct marketing  acquisitions or purchases of deposits 
the bank also seeks to increase its product and service utilization for each individual depositor 
in addition  the bank s primary strategy includes the origination of  and investment in  mortgage loans  with an emphasis on multi family residential loans 
multi family residential lending is a significant business of the bank  reflecting the fact that much of the housing in its primary lending area is multi family housing 
the bank also strives to provide a stable source of liquidity and earnings through the purchase of investment grade securities  seeks to maintain the asset quality of its loans and other investments  and uses appropriate portfolio a nd asset liability management techniques in an effort to manage the effects of interest rate volatility on its profitability and capital 
loan originations with an emphasis on multi family residential and commercial real estate lending management of the bank believes that multi family residential loans provide advantages as investment assets 
initially  they offer a higher yield than single family loans or investment securities of comparable maturities or terms to repricing 
origination and processing costs for the bank s multi family residential and commercial real estate loans are lower per thousand dollars of originations than comparable one to four family loan costs 
in addition  the bank s market area generally has provided a stable flow of new and refinanced multi family residential loan originations 
in order to address the higher credit risk associated with multi family residential lending  the bank has developed underwriting standards that it believes are reliable in order to maintain consistent credit quality for its new loans 
liquidity and capital resources the bank s primary sources of funds are deposits  proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans  mortgage backed securities and investments  borrowings  and  to a lesser extent  proceeds from the sale of fixed rate  one to four family mortgage loans to the secondary mortgage market 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investments are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and prepayments on mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are influenced by interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
funding for loan originations and security purchases during the fiscal year ended june  was obtained primarily from principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  deposit growth  and maturities and calls of investment securities 
during the fiscal year ended june   principal repayments on real estate loans totaled million and principal repayments on mortgage backed securities totaled million  compared to principal repayments on real estate loans of million and principal repayments on mortgage backed securities of million during the year ended june  the increase in principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities resulted from added customer refinance activities associated with declines in interest rates during the period january through june maturit ies and calls of investment securities totaled million during the year ended june   and million during the year ended june  during the period january  through june   the company and bank experienced an increased level of call activity on their investment securities due to the reduction in market interest rates 
deposit flows are affected by  among other factors  the general level of interest rates and the products and interest rates offered by competitors 
deposits increased million during the year ended june   compared to an increase of million during the year ended june  the increase in deposits during both years reflected increased marketing efforts that helped generate additional deposit balances in cds and core deposit accounts 
the increase was also partially attributable to a consumer trend to move monies out of the equity markets and into deposit accounts during the year ended june  the greatest growth during this period was realized in money market accounts  which increased million during the year ended june   and million during the year ended june  the additional level of deposit growth during the year ended june  reflected an extension of the successful promotional deposit activities commenced during the fiscal year ended june   particularly money market deposit promotions 
in addition  the fiscal year ended june  saw the establishment of two de novo branch offices  which gathered approximately million in deposits as of june  cds scheduled to mature in one year or less from june  totaled million 
based upon the bank s current pricing strategy and deposit retention experience  management believes that the bank will retain a significant portion of such deposits 
during the year ended june   repos declined million on a net basis and fhlbny advances increased million on a net basis 
during the year ended june   management elected not to renew a portion of maturing short term borrowings of both the holding company and the bank as a result of increased liquidity generated during the period from increased loan and mortgage backed security amortization and deposit inflows 
in addition  during the year ended june   management elected to prepay million of short and medium term repos and fhlbny advances and replace a portion of these borrowings with longer term fhlbny advances possessing a lower average interest cost 
as of june   there were million in borrowings due to mature or reprice within one year  the majority of which are obligations of t he bank 
stockholders equity increased million during the year ended june   due to the addition of net income of million  the increase to equity of million related to activities of stock benefit plans  and the increase to equity of million related to the amortization of the employee stock ownership plan of dime community bancshares  inc and affiliates esop and the recognition and retention plan of outside directors  officers and employees of dime community bancshares  inc rrp stock benefit plans 
both the esop and rrp have investments in the holding company s common stock that are recorded as reductions in stockholders equity contra equity balances 
as compensation expense is recognized on the esop and rrp  the contra equity balances are reduced  resulting in an increase to t otal equity 
all of the aforementioned increases to equity during the fiscal year ended june  were partially offset by treasury stock purchases of million  cash dividends of million paid to shareholders  and purchases of stock by both the benefit maintenance plan of dime community bancshares  inc bmp of million and the rrp of  during the same period 
the bank s primary uses of liquidity and capital resources are the origination of real estate loans and the purchase of mortgage backed and other securities 
during the year ended june   real estate loan originations totaled million  compared to million for the year ended june  increases in interest rates during the period april through december contributed to a decline in loan origination activity during the year ended june  declines in interest rates during the period january through june contributed to an increase in origination activity during the year ended june  purchases of investment and mortgage backed securities  which were million during the year ended june   totaled million for the year ended june  the increase in pu rchase activity during the year ended june  reflects a greater volume of short term securities acquisitions viewed as temporary investments that would ultimately be invested in real estate loans 
at june   the bank had million of commitments outstanding to originate mortgage loans  compared to million outstanding at june  during the year ended june   the holding company purchased  shares as adjusted for the stock dividend paid on august  and the stock dividend paid on april  of its common stock into treasury 
all shares were recorded at the acquisition cost  which totaled million during the year ended june  as of june   up to million shares remain available for purchase under authorized share purchase programs 
based upon the closing price of its common stock of per share as of june   the holding company would utilize million in funds in order to purchase all of these remaining authorized shares 
for the holding company to complete these share purchases  it will likely require dividend distributions from the bank 
the levels of the bank s short term liquid assets are dependent on its operating  financing and investing activities during any given period 
the bank monitors its liquidity position on a daily basis 
during the year ended june   the bank experienced increased liquidity resulting from deposit growth  as well as higher levels of real estate loan and mortgage backed securities prepayments 
as of june   a portion of these funds had not been used to fund loan originations or other investment activities 
temporary excess liquidity is invested in overnight federal funds sales and various money market investments 
in the event that the bank should require funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  additional sources of funds are available through use of its borrowing line at the fhlbny 
at june   the bank had the immediate capacity to borrow an additional million from the fhlbny  and an additional potential borrowing capacity of million available should it acquire the requisite level of fhlbny common stock under its current borrowing agreement with the fhlbny 
the bank is subject to minimum regulatory capital requirements imposed by the ots  which requirements are  as a general matter  based on the amount and composition of an institution s assets 
at june   the bank was in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements 
in addition  at june   the bank was considered well capitalized for all regulatory purposes see item business regulation regulation of federal savings associations capital requirements 
analysis of net interest income the bank s profitability  like that of most financial institutions  is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earnings assets  such as loans and securities  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits or borrowings 
net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate earned or paid on them 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s consolidated statements of operations for the years ended june   and  and reflects the average yield on interest earning assets and average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing interest income or expense by th e average balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  respectively  for the periods indicated 
average balances are derived from daily balances 
the yields and costs include fees that are considered adjustments to yields

net interest margin represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
net interest rate spread represents the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
rate volume analysis net interest income can also be analyzed in terms of the impact of fluctuating interest rates on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and changes in the volume of these assets and liabilities 
the following table represents the extent to which variations in interest rates and the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i variances attributable to fluctuations in volume change in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii variances attributable to rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  and iii the net change 
variances attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to the volume and the changes due to rate

assets totaled billion at june   an increase of million from total assets of billion at june  the growth in assets was experienced primarily in real estate loans  which increased million during the year ended june  during the year ended june   real estate loan originations totaled million  of which million were multi family residential and commercial real estate loans 
substantially all of the loan originations during the fiscal year ended june   were retained in the bank s portfolio 
real estate loan origination levels were driven by a significant decline in interest rates during the period january through december offsetting the growth in real estate loans from originations were increases in principal repayment l evels during the fiscal year ended june  principal repayments totaled million during the year ended june   and experienced significant growth during the period january through june  as a result of declines in interest rates 
federal funds sold and other short term investments increased million during the year ended june   due to increased liquidity resulting from higher levels of real estate loan and mortgage backed securities prepayments  as well as deposit growth during the period 
as of june   this increased liquidity had not yet been used to fund loan originations or other investment activities 
investment securities available for sale increased million during the year ended june   due primarily to purchases of million in securities during the three months ended june   as excess liquid funds were invested primarily in short and medium term obligations of us agencies 
during the year ended june   mortgage backed securities available for sale and held to maturity declined million and million  respectively 
total principal repayments on mortgage backed securities were million during the period due to lower interest rates  and were partially offset by combined net purchases of million 
encumbered mortgage backed securities declined million during the year ended june  as a result of a reduction in the levels of repos during the same period 
due to consistently strong liquidity levels experienced at the holding company and the bank during the year ended june   management elected not to replace a portion of maturing repos 
liabilities 
total liabilities increased million during the year ended june   as deposit growth of million was partially offset by a decline of million in borrowings 
the growth in deposits resulted from the success of various sales and marketing activities during the period  as well as an apparent consumer trend to move monies out of the equity markets and into deposit accounts 
the sales and marketing activities targeted growth in core deposit balances with particular emphasis upon money market and checking accounts and customer households with a focus upon relationship development 
as a result of these efforts  core deposits increased as a percentage of total deposits from at june  to at june  the growth in deposits was utilized to fund loan originations during the period and reduce the level of borrowings  with excess deposit flows retained in federal funds sold and other short term investments 
borrowings declined million during the year ended june   with a decline of million experienced in repos  partially offset by an increase of million in fhlbny advances see liquidity and capital resources

comparison of financial condition at june  and june  assets 
assets totaled billion at june   an increase of million from total assets of billion at june  the growth in assets was experienced primarily in real estate loans  which increased million during the year ended june  the increase in real estate loans resulted primarily from real estate loan originations of million during the year ended june   of which million were multi family residential loans  and million were commercial real estate loans 
real estate loan origination levels  which had declined from april through december  increased from january through june as a result of declines in interest rates that generated increased loan refinance activity 
principal repayments on real estate loans  although increasing in total due to growth in the loan portfolio  declined as a percentage of the total loan portfolio during the period april through december as a result of increases in interest rates 
these principal repayments subsequently increased as a percentage of the total loan portfolio during the period january through june  due to reductions in interest rates during this period 
federal funds sold and short term investments increased million during the year ended june  due to increased deposit inflows resulting from promotional activities 
at june   these funds had not yet been invested in loans or investment securities 
offsetting the increases in real estate loans  federal funds sold and short term investments was a decline of million in investment securities held to maturity and available for sale during the year ended june  calls of million were experienced on these securities during the year ended june   as a result of declines in interest rates during the period january through june these funds were utilized primarily to fund loan originations 
liabilities 
total liabilities increased million during the year ended june   due primarily to an increase of million in deposits 
the growth in deposits resulted from both the success of various sales and marketing activities during the year  as well as an apparent consumer trend to move monies out of the equity markets  particularly equity mutual funds  and into deposit accounts 
sales and marketing activities of the bank targeted growth in core deposit balances with particular emphasis upon money market and checking accounts and customer households with a focus upon relationship development 
cds increased million during the year ended june   primarily from promotional offerings and  to a lesser extent  outflows of mutual fund monies into deposits 
in addition  escrow and other depos its increased million during this period as a result of growth in mortgage escrow funds 
the growth in deposits and escrow was utilized to fund the growth in loans during the period  with excess deposit flows retained in federal funds sold 
repos declined million and fhlbny advances declined million during the year ended june   as deposit growth provided cost effective funding for asset growth during the period  resulting in less reliance upon borrowings for funding 
stockholders equity 
stockholders equity increased million during the year ended june  see liquidity and capital resources 
comparison of operating results for the fiscal years ended june  and general 
net income was million during the year ended june   an increase of million over net income of million during the year ended june  during the year ended june   net interest income increased million  the provision for loan losses declined  non interest income increased million and non interest expense increased  resulting in increased pre tax income of million 
goodwill amortization  which was million during the year ended june   was eliminated during the year ended june  pursuant to the adoption of sfas effective july   partially offsetting an increase of million in non interest expense 
income tax expense increased million as a result of the increased pre tax income 
net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended june  increased million to million from million during the year ended june  this increase was attributable to both an increase of million in interest income and a decline of million in interest expense during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  the interest rate spread increased basis points from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june   and the net interest margin increased basis points from to during the same period 
the increase in interest rate spread and net interest margin both reflected a basis point decline in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  as well as a shift in the composition of interest bearing liabilities away from higher cost borrowings and towards lower cost money market and other deposit accounts 
during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   the average balance of deposits  including non interest bearing checking accounts  increased as a result of ongoing deposit marketing promotions and customer sales activities 
in addition  the average balance of real estate loans increased during the fiscal year ended june   and the average rate on real estate loans was less susceptible to changes in interest rates than other interest earning assets since real estate loans possess a longer aver age term to their maturity or next interest rate reset 
during the period january through december  the federal open market committee fomc reduced the overnight inter bank borrowing rate on eleven different occasions  moving from a beginning rate of to an ending rate of 
because the bank s liabilities generally possess a shorter average term to maturity than its assets  the net interest margin and interest rate spread both benefited from these reductions in interest rates 
while a significant portion of the benefit of liabilities repricing to lower rates was realized during the fiscal year ended june   management anticipates that the reductions in interest rates will favorably impact the company s net interest income during the upcoming year see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 
the increase in net interest margin additionally reflected growth in the ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities from during the year ended june  to during the year ended june   reflecting additional equity generated during the period  a portion of which was invested in interest earning assets 
interest income 
interest income was million during the year ended june   an increase of million from million during the year ended june  increased interest income on real estate loans of million during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  was partially offset by declines in interest income on mortgage backed securities of million  on investment securities of million and on other short term investments of  during the same period 
as part of its ongoing strategy  the bank continued to emphasize growth in real estate loans as its primary interest earning asset  and de emphasized its securities portfolio while loan origination demand was strong 
the increase in interest income on real estate loans was attributable to an increase of million in the average balance of real estate loans resulting from real estate loan originations during the period july  through june  during the years ended june  and  real estate loan originations totaled million and million  respectively 
the decline of million in interest income on mortgage backed securities and of million on investment securities resulted from declines in both the average interest rate and average balance of these assets 
during the year ended june   the average balance of mortgage backed securities declined million and investment securities declined million  due to principal repayments  maturities and calls of these securities that were partially offset by purchase activity 
interest income on other short term investments declined by  due to a decline of basis points in average yield during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   reflecting declines in short term interest rates during the period january through december overall  the yield on interest earning assets declined basis points from during the year ended june  to during the year ended june  declines in the overnight inter bank borrowing rate brought about by the actions of the fomc during the period january through december contributed to general decreases in interest rates  resulting in a reduction in the average yield of basis points on mortgage backed securities  basis points on investment securities and basis points on other short term investments during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  the yield on real estate loans declined by only basis points during this period 
real estate loans possess longer terms to maturity or interest rate repricing and  therefore  reacted slower than other interest ear ning assets to the declines in interest rates during the fiscal year ended june  interest expense 
interest expense declined million  to million during the year ended june   from million during the year ended june  the decline in interest expense resulted substantially from a reduction of million in interest expense on borrowed funds  which resulted from a decline of million in the average balance of borrowed funds during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  the average cost of cds  the next largest component of interest expense  declined by basis points  resulting in a reduction in interest expense of million during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  the average cost of money market accounts also declined basis points during the same period 
the average cost o f savings accounts declined basis points during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   resulting in a decline in interest cost of million during the period 
these declines in average cost all reflected reductions in interest rates due to the actions of the fomc during the period january through december interest expense on money market accounts increased million during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   despite the decline of basis points in average cost during the period  resulting from an increase of million in the average balance of these deposits during this period 
the growth in the average balance of money market accounts resulted from ongoing marketing promotions related to these accounts 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was  during the year ended june   compared to  during the year ended june  during the quarter ended december   an additional provision of  was recorded related to a loan added to troubled debt restructurings 
the provision of  during the year ended june  reflected the growth in the loan portfolio during the month period ended june  due to net charge offs of  recorded during the year ended june   the allowance for loan losses declined  during the same period 
during the year ended june   overall asset quality required no additional provisions beyond the  allocated to cover loan portfolio growth during the period 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million  to million  during the year ended june   from million during the year ended june  the increase resulted primarily from increased prepayment fee income included in other non interest income of million  as loan prepayments increased during the period due to declines in interest rates 
in addition  fee income increased  during the year due to an increase of  in deposit customer fees 
during the year ended june   a gain on the sale of securities and other assets of million was recorded  primarily from the sale of equity investments 
during the year ended june   a gain of million on the sale of securities and other assets was recorded which also related primarily to sales of equity in vestments 
the gains on sales of equity securities during the fiscal year ended june  were utilized to offset a portion of expenses associated with the prepayment of fhlbny advances during the year 
non interest expense 
non interest expense was million during the year ended june    above the level during the year ended june  salary and employee benefits increased million during the year ended june  as a result of growth in management and employees added to satisfy needs created by the following growth in loan portfolio balance  growth in deposit balances  added deposit products  and two new retail branches 
in addition  the employee benefit costs associated with the esop  which are calculated based upon the average market value of the holding company s common stock  increased  due to an increase in the average market value of the holding company s common stock during the period  and were offset by the reduction of  in expenses associated with the rrp  as the amortization of the initial stock awards under the rrp was completed on february  goodwill amortization expense declined million during the year ended june  effective july   goodwill amortization was eliminated in accordance with the adoption of sfas see note to the consolidated financial statements 
increased data processing costs of  during the fiscal year ended june  resulted from additional systems activity related to growth in the loan portfolio and additional deposit activity 
other expenses increased million during the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june   due primarily to growth in public relations expenses of  and marketing expenses of  as well as various branch administrative expenses such as supplies  postage and protective services associated with increased customer activities and two new branches added during the fiscal year 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased million during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   due primarily to an increase of million in pre tax net income 
the effective tax rate decreased from to during the year ended june   due to the implementation of tax management strategies 
comparison of operating results for the fiscal years ended june  and general 
net income was million during the year ended june   an increase of million over net income of million during the year ended june  during the year ended june   an increase of million in non interest income was partially offset by increases of million in non interest expense   in the provision for loan losses  and  in income tax expense 
net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended june  increased  to million from million during the year ended june  the increase was attributable to the overall growth in interest earning assets over the corresponding increase in interest bearing liabilities 
however  the beneficial impact of this growth was offset  in part  by the decline in the interest rate spread during this period 
the interest rate spread declined basis points from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june   and the net interest margin declined basis points from to during the same period 
the decline in interest rate spread and net interest margin both reflected a basis point increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  resulting primarily from an increase in the average cost of borrowed funds of basis points  cds of basis points and money market accounts of basis points 
these interest rate increases all reflected increases in general interest rates during the period april through december the narrowing of the interest rate spread and net interest margin also reflected the million increase in average borrowed funds  the highest cost interest bea ring liability 
the holding company s issuance  on april   of million in subordinated notes with a stated annual coupon of additionally contributed to the growth in interest expense on borrowed funds  as twelve months of expense was incurred on these notes during the fiscal year ended june  compared to two and one half months of expense incurred during the fiscal year ended june  during the period january  through june   reductions in general interest rates provided some reduction in borrowing costs  which partially offset the aforementioned items 
during the three months ended march   the federal reserve bank increased its overnight borrowing rate by basis points on two different occasions  moving from a beginning rate of to an ending rate of 
this rate was subsequently increased an additional basis points during the period april through december to  which is where it stood at december  during the period january  through june   the federal reserve bank reduced its federal funds borrowing rate on six different occasions  moving from the beginning overnight borrowing rate of to as of june  because the majority of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities do not reprice daily  the bank experiences delays in recognizing the effects of interest rate movements 
as a result  despite t he significant reductions in interest rates by the federal reserve bank  which brought the overnight borrowing rate at june  below its level at june   the overall yield on interest earning assets and cost on interest bearing liabilities were higher during the year ended june  than the year ended june  however  since the bank s liabilities typically reprice more rapidly than its assets  it did experience significant benefits to its net interest spread and margin from the interest rate decreases during the quarter ended june  see item a qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended june  was million  an increase of million from million during the year ended june  the growth in interest income was attributable to increased interest income on real estate loans of million 
the growth in interest income on real estate loans was attributable primarily to an increase of million in the average balance of real estate loans  resulting from million of real estate loans originated during the twelve month period ended june  partially offsetting the increase in interest income on real estate loans was a decline of million in income on other interest earning assets composed of federal funds sold  commercial paper  and fhlbny capital stock from million during the year ended june  to million during the fiscal year ended june  this decline resulted from a reduction in the average balance of these assets of million  as the bank maintained a higher than normal level of investment in these short term assets during the quarter ended december  for liquidity purposes 
interest income on mortgage backed securities declined million during the year ended june   reflecting a reduction of million in average balance  and interest income on investment securities declined million  from million  during the fiscal year ended june  to million during the fiscal year ended june   reflecting a decline in average balance of million 
these declines in average balance resulted from an ongoing strategic shift in the composition of interest earning assets towards real estate loans 
the average balance of these securities during the year ended june  was below its level during the comparable period as mor e securities funds were allocated to real estate loans 
overall  the average yield on interest earning assets increased basis points from during the year ended june  to during the year ended june  the increase was attributable primarily to increases in the average yield of basis points on real estate loans  basis points on mortgage backed securities and basis points on other interest earning assets  resulting primarily from general market interest rate increases during the period april through december the average interest rate on real estate loan originations during the year ended june  was  compared to during the year ended june   reflecting the increase in general market interest rates during the period april through december the ongoing strategic shift in composition of interest earning assets away from investment and mortgage backed securities and towards real estate loans also had a beneficial impact on the average yield of interest earning assets during the year ended june  interest expense 
interest expense increased million  to million  during the year ended june   from million during the year ended june  this increase resulted primarily from increased interest expense of million on borrowed funds  which resulted from both growth in the average balance of borrowed funds of million during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   and an increase in the average cost of borrowed funds of basis points 
the increase in the average balance of borrowed funds resulted from growth in fhlbny advances from million at june  to million at june  while much of this growth occurred during the period july  through june   when the bank s deposit generation levels were lower  the full effect of this increase was recognized in the average balance computation for the year ended june   however  only a portion of the growth was recognized in the average balance computation for the year ended june  the growth in borrowings resulted primarily from funding that was needed to support loan origination levels in excess of deposit funding during years ended june  and average borrowings also increased during this period as a result of the million in subordinated debt added on april   at a stated annual coupon of 
the subordinated notes contributed million to interest expense during the year ended june  the increase in average cost of borrowed funds reflected both prepayment expenses of  and the overall increase in interest rates during the period april through december there was no prepayment expense on borrowed funds during the fiscal year ended june  interest expense on money mar ket accounts increased million  resulting from both an increase of million in the average balance and an increase of basis points in average cost of these deposits during the year ended june  compared to the same period of the prior year 
the increase in average balance and average cost of money market accounts reflected the growth of these accounts from ongoing interest rate promotions during the period july  through june  interest expense on cds also increased million  which resulted from an increase of basis points in the average cost of these deposits  reflecting the overall increase in interest rates early in the fiscal year ended june  interest expense on savings accounts declined  due a decline in average balance in these accounts of million  with much of these funds being moved to money market accounts 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was  during the year ended june   compared to  during the year ended june  during the quarter ended december   an additional provision of  was recorded related to a troubled debt restructuring loan 
otherwise  the bank s overall asset quality remained relatively stable see item business asset quality 
the remaining loan loss provision of  during the period reflected both the bank s response to continued growth in real estate loans and its recognition of slight increases in delinquent and impaired loans 
the allowance for loan losses increased  during the year ended june   as the loan loss provision of  exceeded net charge offs of  during the peri od 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million  to million  during the year ended june   from million during the year ended june  the increase resulted primarily from an increase of on the gain resulting from the disposal of securities and other assets 
during the year ended june   a net gain on the sale of equity investments of million was recorded 
during the year ended june   net losses of million associated with the sales of investments and mortgage backed securities was recorded  which were partially offset by a gain of million on the sale of deposits at the gates avenue  brooklyn branch 
additionally  the bank s investment in boli  which was instituted in may  contributed an additional million to other non interest income du ring the year ended june  loan prepayment fees  a component of other non interest income  declined  to  during the year ended june  compared to million during the year ended june   reflecting reduced loan refinancing activity resulting from increased interest rates early in the fiscal year ended june   but were partially offset by increased bank retail fee income a component of service charges and other fees of  during the fiscal year ended june   which resulted from increased deposit activities and a new customer debit card service instituted during the fiscal year 
non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million  from million during the year ended june   to million during the year ended june  salary and employee benefits remained relatively constant during the fiscal year ended june  benefit plan restructurings  which became effective on july   provided reductions of million in salaries and employee benefits expense during the year ended june  during the year ended june   in conjunction with the restructurings  a non recurring reduction in expense of million was recorded related to the curtailment gain resulting from the freezing of benefits accrued under the retirement plan 
the restructurings additionally contributed to the decline in esop expense of million during the fiscal year ended june   as the amortization period associated with the esop expense was increased  thus lowering the annual esop expense 
offsetting these declines were increases in salaries and benefit s of million resulting primarily from base pay and staff increases necessitated by loan and deposit growth  and k plan expenses  as k plan contributions were reinstated effective july  occupancy and equipment expense increased  during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   due primarily to increased rental  utility and branch property costs on the bank s branch offices that aggregated approximately  in addition  the bank experienced increased depreciation expense of  during the year ended june   due to the accelerated depreciation of computer equipment acquired in the fibc acquisition 
this accelerated depreciation resulted from management s revised estimate of the estimated useful life of the equipment 
federal deposit insurance premiums declined  during the year ended june  compared to june   due to a reduction in the assessment rates on saif insured deposits 
data processing costs increased  during the year ended june   due to an increase in loan and deposit activity during the period  and other expenses increased  due primarily to increased advertising and direct marketing expenses of income tax expense 
income tax expense increased  during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   due to an increase in pre tax income of million 
the increase in income tax expense was partially offset by a decline in income tax expense resulting primarily from tax benefits associated with activities of subsidiary companies as well as the favorable tax status on income associated with the bank s boli investment  both of which contributed to a decline in the effective tax rate from to 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased costs of operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the company s consolidated assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s consolidated performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily fluctuate in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
critical accounting policies accounting estimates made by the company in its application of accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the most significant example of management s use of estimates is the accounting for the allowance for loans losses 
see notes and to the company s consolidated audited financial statements which document accounting procedures utilized by management in determining the allowance for loan losses 
see item business allowance for loan losses which further documents management s assumptions utilized in determining the allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the allowance for loan losses  significant estimates are also made in determining the following amounts presented in the company s consolidated financial statements purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisitions of conestoga and fibc and the fair value of financial instruments 
all of the significant accounting policies and assumptions utilized by management in determining these estimates are documented in the notes to the company s audited financial statements 
adoption of accounting standards that materially impacted the company s financial results 
effective july   the company adopted sfas goodwill and other intangible assets  which established new standards for goodwill acquired in a business combination see note to the company s consolidated audited financial statements 
since july   the company has not adopted any new accounting standard nor changed any existing accounting policy that has materially impacted its financial condition or results of operations 
recently issued accounting pronouncements recently issued accounting standards accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  replacing sfas sfas established a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale based upon the framework established in sfas sfas also resolved various implementation issues related to sfas the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and  generally  are to be applied prospectively 
the company adopted sfas effective july  adoption of sfas did not have a material impact upon the company s financial condition or results of operations 
sfas in april  the fasb issued sfas rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
rescinds sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  which required gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect 
upon adoption of sfas  companies will be required to apply the criteria in accounting principles board apb  opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  in determining the classification of gains and losses resulting from the extinguishm ent of debt 
upon adoption  companies must reclassify prior period items that do not satisfy the extraordinary item classification criteria in apb opinion no 
additionally  sfas amends sfas  accounting for leases  to require that certain lease modifications having economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
the provisions of sfas related to the rescission of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after may  all other provisions of sfas are effective for transactions occurring and or financial statements issued on or after may  the implementation of sfas provisions effective after may  did not have a material impact on the company s or the bank s financial condition or results of operations 
implementation of the remaining provisions is not expected to have a material impact upon the financial condition or results of operations of the company or the bank 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
in june  fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that a liability for costs associated with exit or disposition activities be recognized when the liability is incurred and be measured at fair value and adjusted for changes in estimated cash flows 
gaap provides for the recognition of such costs at the date of management s commitment to an exit plan 
under sfas  management s commitment to an exit plan would not be sufficient  by itself  to recognize a liability 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  and is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations or financial condition of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk as a depository financial institution  the bank s primary source of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of both income and expense recorded on a significant portion of the bank s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the bank s real estate loan portfolio  concentrated primarily within the new york city metropolitan area  is subject to risks associated with the local economy see item business asset quality 
during the period july through december  the holding company and bank both operated under a challenging interest rate environment  which featured little difference between rates available to the bank on short term and long term investments 
under such a flat yield curve environment  financial institutions faced a challenge to earn a positive spread between interest income on new or renewed loans and investments and interest expense paid on new or renewed deposits and borrowings 
the flat yield curve environment experienced during this period was a contributing factor in either the stagnation in or the mild reduction in the company s consolidated interest rate spread 
during the period january  through december   declines in short term interest rates produced a widening gap between short term and long term interest rates 
this interest rate environment favorably impacted the net interest spread and margin during the period january through june neither the holding company nor the bank are subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
in addition  the company owns no trading assets  nor did it engage in any hedging transactions utilizing derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps or embedded derivative instruments during the fiscal year ended june  that require bifurcation 
in the future  the company may  with appropriate board approval  engage in hedging transactions utilizing derivative instruments 
since a majority of the company s consolidated interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are located at the bank  virtually all of the interest rate risk exposure exists at the bank level 
as a result  all of the significant interest rate risk management procedures are performed at the bank level 
the bank s interest rate risk management strategy is designed to limit the volatility of net interest income and preserve capital over a broad range of interest rate movements and has three primary components 
assets 
the bank s largest single asset type is the adjustable rate multi family residential loan 
multi family residential loans typically carry shorter average terms to maturity than one to four family residential loans  thus significantly reducing the overall level of interest rate risk 
approximately of multi family residential loans originated during the year ended june  were adjustable rate  with repricing typically occurring after five or seven years  compared to during the previous year 
in addition  the bank has sought to include in its portfolio various types of adjustable rate one to four family loans and adjustable and floating rate investment securities  which generally have repricing terms of three years or less 
at june   adjustable rate whole loans totaled billion  or of total assets  and adjustable rate investment securities cmos  remics  mortgage backed securities issued by gses and other securities totaled million  or of total assets 
at june   adjustable rate multi family residential  commercial real estate and one to four family loans totaled billion  or of total assets  and adjustable rate securities totaled million  or of total assets 
deposit liabilities 
as a traditional community based savings bank  the bank is largely dependent upon its base of competitively priced core deposits to provide stability on the liability side of the balance sheet 
the bank has retained many loyal customers over the years through a combination of quality service  convenience  and a stable and experienced staff 
core deposits  at june   were billion  or of total deposits 
the balance of cds as of june  was million  or of total deposits  of which million  or  mature within one year 
the weighted average maturity of the bank s cds at june  was months compared to months at june  depending on market conditions  the bank generally prices its cds in an effort to encourage the extension of the average m aturities of deposit liabilities beyond one year 
wholesale funds 
the bank is a member of the fhlbny  which provided the bank with a borrowing line of up to million at june  the bank borrows from the fhlbny for various purposes 
at june   the bank had outstanding advances of million with the fhlbny 
additionally  in june  the bank received approval from its board to accept brokered deposits as a source of funds 
at both june  and june   brokered deposits totaled million 
interest sensitivity gap the bank regularly monitors interest rate sensitivity through a calculation of its interest sensitivity gap 
the interest sensitivity gap is the difference between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities anticipated to mature or reprice within a specific period 
the interest sensitivity gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets anticipated to mature or reprice within a specified time frame exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated to mature or reprice within the same period 
conversely  the interest sensitivity gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated to mature or reprice within a specific time frame exceeds the amount of interest earning assets anticipated to mature or reprice within the same period 
in a rising interest rate environment  an institution with a positive interest sensitivity gap would generally be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the yields of its assets relative to the costs of its liabilities and thus an increase in the institution s net interest income  whereas an institution with a negative interest sensitivity gap would generally be expected to experience a decline in net interest income 
conversely  in a declining interest rate environment  an institution with a positive interest sensitivity gap would generally be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater decline in the yields of its assets relative to the costs of its liabilities and thus a decrease in the institution s net interest income  whereas an institution with a negative interest sensitivity gap would generally be expected to experience an increase in interest income 
the table on the following page sets forth the amounts of the company s consolidated interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at june   which are anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown repricing or maturing during a particular period reflect the earlier of term to repricing or term to repayment of the asset or liability 
the table is intended to provide an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at june  on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments  and scheduled rate adjustments within a three month period and subsequent selected time intervals 
for purposes of presentation in the following table  the bank utilized its historical d eposit attrition experience deposit decay rate for savings accounts 
for now  super now and money market accounts  it utilized the deposit decay rates published by the ots 
all amounts calculated in the table for both loans and mortgage backed securities reflect principal balances expected to reprice as a result of anticipated principal repayments inclusive of early repayments or as a result of contractual interest rate adjustments 
at june  months or less more than months to months more than months to year more than year to years more than years to years more than years non interest bearing total dollars in thousands interest earning assets mortgages and other loans investment securities mortgage backed securities other short term investments fhlbny capital stock total interest earning assets less allowance for loan losses net interest earning assets non interest earning assets total assets interest bearing liabilities savings accounts now and super now accounts money market accounts certificates of deposit borrowed funds subordinated notes interest bearing escrow total interest bearing liabilities checking accounts other non interest bearing liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity positive negative interest sensitivity gap per period positive negative cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets cumulative total interest earning assets as a percent of cumulative total interest bearing liabilities interest earning assets are included in the period in which the balances are expected to be redeployed and or repriced as result of anticipated pre payments  scheduled rate adjustments  and contractual maturities or calls 
based upon historical repayment experience  and where applicable balloon payment dates 
the company s consolidated balance sheet is composed primarily of assets that mature or reprice within five years  with a significant portion maturing or repricing within one year 
in addition  the bank s deposit base is composed primarily of savings accounts  money market accounts and cds with maturities of two years or less 
at june   interest bearing liabilities estimated to mature or reprice within one year totaled billion  while interest earning assets estimated to mature or reprice within one year totaled million  resulting in a negative one year interest sensitivity gap of million  or negative of total assets 
in comparison  at june   the company s consolidated one year interest sensitivity gap was negative million  or negative of total assets 
the decrease in the level of th e one year negative interest sensitivity gap resulted from a significant increase in the estimate of loan prepayments in the one year or less period reflecting the current interest rate environment and recent prepayment experience of the bank s loan portfolio 
certain limitations are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may not react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate with changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features  like annual and lifetime rate caps  which restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in the table 
finally  the ability of certai n borrowers to make scheduled payments on their adjustable rate loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
under interest rate scenarios other than that which existed on june   the interest sensitivity gap for assets and liabilities could differ substantially based upon different assumptions about how core deposit decay rates and loan prepayments would change 
for example  the interest rate risk management model assumes that in a rising rate scenario  by paying competitive rates on non core deposits  a portion of core deposits will transfer to cds and be retained  although at higher cost 
also  in a rising interest rate environment  loan and mortgage backed security prepayment rates would be expected to slow  as borrowers postpone loan refinancings until rates again decline 
interest rate risk exposure npv compliance the bank also manages its interest rate risk through analysis of the change in its net portfolio value npv under several interest rate scenarios 
npv is the difference between the present value of the expected future cash flows of the bank s assets and liabilities  plus the value of net expected cash flows from either loan origination commitments or purchases of securities 
generally  the fair value of fixed rate instruments fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates 
as a result  increases in interest rates could result in decreases in the fair value of interest earning assets  which could adversely affect the company s consolidated results of operations if they were to be sold  or  in the case of interest earning assets classified as available for sale  reduce the company s consolidated stockholders equity  if retained 
the changes in the value of assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates reflect the interest sensitivity of those assets and liabilities 
under gaap  changes in the unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  on securities classified as available for sale will be reflected in stockholders equity through other comprehensive income 
as of june   the company s co nsolidated securities portfolio included million in securities classified as available for sale  which possessed a gross unrealized gain of million 
fluctuations in interest rates could produce significant changes in the value of such securities and could produce significant fluctuations in stockholders equity through other comprehensive income 
neither the holding company nor the bank owned any trading assets as of june  and in order to measure the bank s sensitivity to changes in interest rates  npv is calculated under market interest rates prevailing at a given quarter end pre shock scenario  and under various other interest rate scenarios rate shock scenarios represented by immediate  permanent  parallel shifts in the term structure of interest rates from the actual term structure observed at quarter end 
the changes in npv due to changes in interest rates reflect the interest rate sensitivity of the assets  liabilities  and commitments to either originate or sell loans and or purchase or sell securities that comprise the npv 
the npv ratio under any interest rate scenario is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the present value of the assets in the same scenario the npv ratio 
the analysis that follows presents the estimated npv in the pre shock scenario and four rate shock scenarios and measures the dollar amount and percentage by which each of the rate shock scenario npvs change from the pre shock scenario npv 
interest rate sensitivity is measured by the changes in the various rate shock scenario npv ratios from the pre shock npv ratio 
at june  net portfolio value at june  dollar amount dollar change percentage change npv ratio basis point change in npv ratio npv ratio basis point change in npv ratio interest rate scenario basis points basis points pre shock basis points basis points the model utilized to generate the npvs presented above makes various estimates regarding cash flows from principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities and or call activity on investment securities and borrowings at each level of interest rate change 
actual cash flows could differ significantly from these estimates and could result in significantly different calculated projected npvs 
the npv ratio at june  was in the pre shock scenario  an improvement over the pre shock npv ratio of at june  the npv ratio was in the basis point rate shock scenario at june   also an improvement over the npv ratio of in the basis point rate shock scenario at june  at june   the sensitivity measure in the basis point rate shock scenario was negative basis points  an improvement from the sensitivity measure of negative basis points in the basis point rate shock scenario at june  all of these improvements resulted from a variety of factors that included  but were not limited to  a decline in short term borrowings as a percentage of assets  and growth in core deposits 
on a quarterly basis  an interest rate risk exposure compliance report is presented to the bank s board of directors 
this report  prepared in accordance with thrift bulletin a  issued by the ots  presents a comparison of the bank s estimated pre shock npv to the various estimated npvs calculated under the rate shock scenarios 
the calculated estimates of the resulting npv ratios are compared to current limits established by management and approved by the board of directors
