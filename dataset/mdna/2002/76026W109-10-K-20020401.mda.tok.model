results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of reptron s net sales represented by each line item presented  except for reptron distribution and electronic manufacturing services gross profit  which is presented as a percentage of net sales of the respective segments year ended december  net sales electronic component distribution net sales electronic manufacturing services total net sales gross profit electronic component distribution gross profit electronic manufacturing services total gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income loss interest expense  net earnings loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net earnings loss before extraordinary item extraordinary gain on extinguishment of debt  net of tax net earnings loss excluding a million inventory writedown in the second quarter of excluding a million inventory writedown in the second quarter of excluding a million deferred tax benefit reserve recorded in compared to net sales 
total net sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in ecd total net sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in management believes that this decrease resulted primarily from a significant industry wide slowdown in the sales volume and price reductions of electronic components in the united states 
sales of semiconductors  passive components and electromechanical components accounted for  and  respectively  of ecd net sales compared to  and  respectively  of ecd net sales 
sales generated from the top four ecd vendors accounted for approximately million  or of ecd net sales  as compared with approximately million or of ecd net sales 
ems net sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease is primarily attributable to decreased demand within the semiconductor equipment and telecommunications customer base of ems 
the three largest ems customers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of ems net sales  and  respectively  of total reptron net sales as compared to  and  respectively  of ems net sales  and  respectively  of total reptron net sales 
gross profit 
total gross profit decreased million or  from million in to million in during the second quarter of  we recorded a non cash inventory writedown charge of million which is included in cost of sales 
as a result of this charge  gross margin decreased from to in as compared to in the remaining decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable to the overall decline in business as a result of general economic conditions 
ecd gross profit decreased million  or  from million in to million in during the second quarter of  the ecd segment recorded a non cash inventory writedown charge of million to reflect the rapid decline in market pricing for electronic components and as a result of distributor supplier lines terminated by reptron 
this charge is included in cost of sales and caused gross margin to decline from to in ecd gross margin was in the decrease in gross profit dollars  excluding the effect of the inventory charge  is due to a decrease in sales experienced in as compared to ems gross profit decreased million  or  from million in to million in during the second quarter of  the ems segment recorded a non cash inventory writedown charge of million as a result of excess components due to significant reductions in customer demands and decline in pricing of electronic components 
this charge is included in cost of sales and caused gross margin to decline from to in as compared to in the decrease in gross profit and gross margin from prior periods is primarily attributable to the under absorption of fixed costs in the manufacturing process as a result of the significant reduction of sales orders in versus selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million to million million excluding a million gain on the sale of assets in the fourth quarter of in these expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased from in to in the remaining decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to cost cutting measures implemented in our overall employee base declined from  in to  in  a reduction in workforce 
interest expense 
net interest expense decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease in net interest expense is the result of the combination of an increase in average outstanding debt of million from million in to million in  and a decrease in average interest rates from in to in compared to net sales 
total net sales increased million  or  from million in to million in ecd total net sales increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase resulted primarily from improved market conditions for the sale of electronic components in the united states 
additionally  we made significant investments in personnel and infrastructure  which has aided in sales volume growth 
sales of semiconductors  passive components and electromechanical components accounted for  and  respectively  of ecd net sales compared to  and  respectively  of ecd net sales 
sales generated from the top four ecd vendors accounted for approximately million  or of ecd net sales  as compared with approximately million or of ecd net sales 
ems net sales increased million  or  from million in to million in after adjusting for net sales of reptron display and system integration  acquired in october   net sales increased million or as compared with net sales 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased demands from within the existing customer base of ems 
the three largest ems customers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of ems net sales  and  respectively  of our total net sales as compared to  and  respectively  of ems net sales  and  respectively  of our total net sales 
sales from the hibbing  minnesota  tampa  florida  gaylord  michigan and fremont  california manufacturing facilities accounted for approximately   and respectively  of ems net sales as compared with   and  respectively  of ems net sales 
gross profit 
total gross profit increased million or  from million in to million in the gross margin increased from in to in ecd gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in ecd gross margin increased from in to in this increase in gross margin was due primarily to improved selling and pricing practices and stronger electronic component market conditions experienced in as compared with market conditions in ems gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in and its gross margin increased from in to in this increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to the improvements in asset utilization and manufacturing processes 
additionally  the fremont plant generated higher gross margins than the other ems facilities in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million to million in selling  general and administrative expenses of reptron display and system integration were approximately million 
after adjusting for the effects of reptron display and system integration  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased variable expenses associated with increased sales volumes 
these expenses  as a percentage of net sales  decreased from in to in interest expense 
net interest expense increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase in net interest expense resulted primarily from an increase in average outstanding debt of million from million  during to million during in addition  our overall average interest rate increased from during to during currency fluctuation reptron pays for its purchases from foreign sources  including asian manufacturers  in united states dollars  which reduces the adverse effects of currency fluctuations 
reptron has not experienced substantial adverse effects from currency fluctuations to date 
liquidity and capital resources reptron primarily finances its operations through subordinated notes  bank credit lines  capital equipment leases  and short term financing through supplier credit lines 
net cash used in or provided by operating activities has historically been provided by net income loss levels combined with fluctuations in inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable 
operating activities for provided cash of approximately million 
this increase in cash flow resulted primarily from decreases in accounts receivables of million and inventories of million  excluding a non cash inventory writedown of million in the second quarter of these items were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable of million and accrued expenses of million 
days sales in accounts receivable were approximately days at december  compared to days at december  annualized inventory turns for were times compared to times for capital expenditures totaled approximately million in these capital expenditures were primarily for the acquisition of manufacturing equipment 
these purchases were funded by the working capital line of credit 
five lenders have made available to reptron a million revolving credit facility the credit agreement through january  borrowings under the credit agreement are collateralized by all inventory  accounts receivable  equipment and general intangibles 
the credit agreement limits the amount of capital expenditures and prohibits the payment of dividends thereby restricting the distribution of retained earnings 
the credit agreement provides for  upon notice to the lender  advancement of funds pursuant to either a domestic rate loan variable at the prime rate  at december  or a eurodollar rate loan based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus an indexed spread at december  
upon notice to the lenders  advances may be converted from one type of loan to the other 
as of december   we were able to borrow the full credit facility based on the borrowing advance formulas provided for in the credit agreement  as amended 
prior to the end of the fiscal year  we anticipated that at december  we would not be in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant provided for in the credit agreement 
consequently  prior to year end  we and our lenders reached an agreement to amend the credit agreement to be effective as of december  the amendment was to provide for removal of the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant for only the period ending december  and was to add future quarterly earnings requirements 
the amendment was signed on february  and by its terms was effective december  amounts outstanding under the credit agreement as of december  were approximately million 
management believes that we will not be in compliance with the earnings requirement contained in the credit agreement  as amended  for at least the first quarter of management has historically been able to obtain waivers for non compliance of credit agreement covenants and believes that we will receive the necessary waiver for the first quarter of and future additional waivers when and if needed 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with these financial covenants in the future or that we will receive waivers from our lenders for non compliance with these covenants 
the elimination of the liquidity provided by the credit agreement would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
management believes that available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditures and working capital needs of our operations as presently conducted 
however  future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on a wide range of factors  including the level of business in existing operations  expansion of facilities and possible acquisitions 
in particular  management is considering various alternatives related to the payment of approximately million of our convertible notes  which will become due in august if the convertible notes are not converted into our common stock we will be required to repay the indebtedness or make other arrangements to refinance the convertible notes 
if we fail to do so  it will result in a default of the convertible notes  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
while there can be no assurance that such financing will be available in amounts and on acceptable terms  management believes that such financing would likely be available on acceptable terms 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and intangible assets 
sfas is effective for all business combinations completed after june  sfas is effective for the year beginning january   however  certain provisions of that statement apply to goodwill and other intangible assets acquired between july  and the effective date of sfas in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement applies to all entities 
it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the provisions of the statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we have engaged a third party valuation consultant to assist in evaluating the impact of the adoption of these standards but have not yet determined the full effect of these recent accounting pronouncements on our financial position and results of operations 
however  beginning january   we will no longer amortize the excess of cost over net assets acquired 
this amortization expense was approximately million in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk while reptron had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at december   we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
approximately of interest bearing borrowings have a fixed interest rate 
however  borrowings under the working capital credit facility bears interest at a variable rate based on the prime rate or the libor 
based on the average floating rate borrowings outstanding throughout  a basis point change in the interest rates would have caused reptron s interest expense  net of the income tax effect  to change by approximately  reptron believes that this amount is not significant to the results of operations
