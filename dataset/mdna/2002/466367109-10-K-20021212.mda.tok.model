table of contents liquidity and capital resources general 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million to approximately million at september  from approximately million at the beginning of the fiscal year 
we expect to maintain low levels of cash and cash equivalents  reinvesting available cash flows from operations to develop new or enhance existing restaurants  and to reduce borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
our working capital deficit increased million to million at september  from million at september  this increase is primarily due to the reclassifications to current liabilities of our revolving bank loans which expire in march and million of financing lease obligations due in january  offset in part by the related reclassification of million in sinking fund payments to other current assets from other assets 
the payment of the financing lease obligations will be funded from the sinking fund  operations and our credit facility 
the company and the restaurant industry in general  maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories  and vendors grant trade credit for purchases such as food and supplies 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new units and refurbishment of existing units  which are reflected as long term assets and not as part of working capital 
at the end of the year  our current ratio was 
to compared with 
to at september   decreasing due to the reclassifications discussed above 
our revolving bank credit agreement  expiring in march  provides for a credit facility of up to million  including letters of credit of up to million 
at september   we had borrowings of million and approximately million of availability under the agreement 
we fully expect to secure new financing before the expiration date of the current credit facility and have engaged a leading bank to complete the arrangement 
total debt outstanding decreased million to million at september  from million at the beginning of fiscal year  primarily due to repayments under the revolving credit facility 
we are subject to a number of customary covenants under our various debt instruments  including limitations on additional borrowings  capital expenditures  lease commitments and dividend payments  as well as requirements to maintain certain financial ratios  cash flows and net worth 
as of september   we were in compliance with these covenants 
in september  the collateral securing the bank credit facility was released  however  the real and personal property previously held as collateral cannot be used to secure other indebtedness of the company 
in addition  certain of our real and personal property secure other indebtedness 
other transactions 
in january  we entered into financing lease arrangements with two limited partnerships the partnerships  in which we sold interests in restaurants for a specified period of time 
the acquisition of the properties  including costs and expenses  was funded through the issuance of million in senior secured notes by a special purpose corporation acting as agent for the partnerships 
on august   we entered into an agreement to repurchase the interests in the restaurant properties that had been encumbered by the financing lease transaction 
pursuant to the agreement  on january   we will reacquire the interests at a price which is sufficient  in connection with previous sinking fund payments  to retire the million senior secured notes 
to effect the acceleration of the retirement of this high interest rate bearing debt  we also agreed to pay a consent fee of million 
in fiscal  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of our outstanding common stock in the open market for an aggregate amount not to exceed million and is in addition to our million common stock repurchase amount authorized december  through september   we had acquired  shares in connection with these authorizations for an aggregate cost of million  and at the end of the year we had approximately million of repurchase availability remaining 
the stock repurchase program is intended to offset the dilutive effect of stock option exercises and to increase shareholder value 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments 
the following is a summary of the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years contractual obligations revolving credit facility financing lease obligations capital lease obligations other long term debt obligations operating lease obligations total contractual obligations other commercial comments stand by letters of credit amount is net of accumulated sinking fund payments of  capital expenditures

in addition  fiscal year included non recurring capital expenditures of million related to the purchase of land in san diego  on which we plan to develop our new innovation center 
fiscal year capital expenditures included million for new restaurant expenditures  million for existing restaurant improvements and million for other additions 
we plan on spending approximately million during fiscal year on capital expenditures 
the projected increase when compared with reflects our decision to increase investments in remodeling restaurant facilities  additional interior enhancements  and our strategic plan to purchase more new restaurant properties verses leasing them as a means to mitigate increasing occupancy costs 
the capital expenditures estimate for also reflects the refinement of our current restaurant prototype to reduce development costs and improve returns 
future liquidity 
we require capital principally to grow the business through new restaurant construction  as well as to maintain and remodel existing restaurants  to service our debt obligations  and for general operating purposes 
our primary short term and long term sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations  our revolving bank credit facility and the conversion of company operated restaurants to franchised restaurants 
additional potential sources of liquidity include various financing opportunities and the sale and leaseback of restaurant properties 
based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  we expect that sufficient cash flows will be generated from operations so that  combined with available financing alternatives  we will be able to meet our debt service  capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
discussion of critical accounting policies we have identified the following as the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective and complex judgments 
information regarding the company s other accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
pension benefits the company sponsors pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet certain eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors which attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans  including assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels  as determined by the company using specified guidelines 
in addition  our outside actuarial consultants also use certain statistical factors such as turnover  retirement and mortality rates to estimate the company s future benefit obligations 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover and retirement rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 

table of contents these differences may impact the amount of pension expense recorded by the company 
due to decreases in interest rates and declines in the return on assets in the plans  the pension expense in fiscal year is expected to be approximately higher than in fiscal year self insurance the company is self insured for a portion of its current and prior years losses related to its workers compensation  general liability  automotive  medical and dental programs 
in estimating the company s self insurance reserves  we utilize independent actuarial estimates of expected losses  which are based on statistical analyses of historical data 
these assumptions are closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or medical costs increase beyond what was expected  reserves might not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded 
long lived assets long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangibles  are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present 
if the sum of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss by the amount which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
our estimates of future cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions or changes in operating performance 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded million in impairment charges related to eight under performing restaurants scheduled for closure in fiscal year during fiscal year  we noted no other triggering events that would indicate the need for additional impairment of any of the company s assets 
legal accruals the company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business 
a determination of the amount accrued  if any  for these contingencies is made after analysis of each matter 
we continually evaluate such accruals and may increase or decrease accrued amounts as we deem appropriate

in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this new standard supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
this statement retains the fundamental provisions of sfas  but addresses its significant implementation issues 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas in the first quarter of fiscal year and expect that the adoption will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

table of contents in april  the fasb issued sfas  rescission of fasb statements   and  amendment of fasb statement  and technical corrections

this statement is effective for all exit or disposal activities initiated after december  and will have no impact on exit liabilities recorded by the company prior to such date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates and commodity prices 
our primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates 
our million credit facility bears interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin based on a financial leverage ratio 
as of september   our applicable margin was set at 
in fiscal year  the average interest rate paid on the credit facility was approximately 
at september   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of million in annual pre tax earnings 
the estimated reduction is based on the outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility at september  changes in interest rates also impact our pension expense 
an assumed discount rate is used in determining the present value of future cash outflows currently expected to be required to satisfy the pension benefit obligation when due 
a hypothetical basis point reduction in the assumed discount rate would result in an estimated increase of million in our future annual pension expense 
we are also exposed to the impact of commodity price fluctuations related to unpredictable factors such as weather and various other market conditions outside our control 
from time to time we enter into commodity futures and option contracts to manage these fluctuations 
we had no open commodity futures and option contracts as of september  at september   we had no other material financial instruments subject to significant market exposure
