item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements include statements regarding our future cash and liquidity position  the extent and timing of future revenues and expenses and customer demand  the deployment of our products  and our reliance on third parties 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statement 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to  those discussed in risk factors below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
intraware overview intraware  inc was incorporated in delaware on august  we are a leading provider of electronic software delivery and management esdm services to enterprise software companies 
using our esdm solutions  software companies can reduce their costs  improve their customer satisfaction  strengthen their compliance with us export laws  and better understand how their customers are using their software 
we have a limited operating history upon which investors may evaluate our business and prospects 
since inception  we have incurred significant losses  and  as of february   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
as of february   we had negative working capital of approximately million 
we expect to incur additional net losses at least through our fiscal quarter ending november  there can be no assurance that our gross profit will increase or continue at its current level 
there also can be no assurance that we will generate cash from operations in future periods  or achieve or maintain profitability or finance our operations without raising additional capital 
our future must be considered in light of our liquidity issues and the risks frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as e commerce 
to address these risks  we must  among other things  continue to develop new services  implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy  continue to develop and upgrade our technology  provide superior customer service  respond to competitive developments and attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
we may also be required to raise additional capital 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our current and future expense levels are based largely on our planned operations and estimates of future sales 
sales and operating results generally depend on the volume and timing of orders received  which are difficult to forecast  particularly in the current business environment 
we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in sales would have an immediate adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we are unable to accurately forecast our sales and believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider accounting policies related to revenue recognition  prepaid licenses  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  and income taxes to be critical accounting policies due to the estimation process involved in each 
revenue recognition we derive software product revenues from resold licenses and maintenance for multiple business software product lines 
although we no longer resell third party software licenses and maintenance as of july   we will continue to recognize revenue from third party software licenses and support over the life of the arrangements made prior to july  online services and technology revenue results primarily from three types of arrangements 
first  it results from sales of our subscribenet electronic software delivery and management service to software vendors 
second  it results from the sale of our proprietary software licenses and related maintenance to companies that use those products internally or that use those products to provide web based services to their customers 
these sales are either made through our direct sales force or through authorized resellers 
third  it results from professional services that we provide to integrate our proprietary software  to convert data for customers  and to customize our subscribenet service for individual customer needs 
as a result of the sale of our asset management software business in may discussed below in liquidity and capital resources  we will no longer derive significant revenue from the second type of arrangement above after our fiscal quarter ending may  we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  we have delivered the service to the customer or we have made the software available for customer download through our web site  or shipped the software to the customer  we believe that collection of these fees is probable  and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed and determinable 
we obtain vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the maintenance element of the resold and proprietary software arrangements based on historical and contractual renewal rates for maintenance 
in such cases  we defer the maintenance revenue at the outset of the arrangement and recognize it ratably over the period during which the maintenance is to be provided generally months  which normally commences on the date the software is delivered 
changes in the previously mentioned factors could have a material impact on actual revenue recognized 
at the time of a license or service sale we assess whether or not any services included within the arrangement require us to perform significant work either to alter the underlying software or to build additional complex interfaces so that the software performs as the customer requests 
if these services are considered to be an essential part of an arrangement  we recognize the entire software license or service fee using the percentage of completion method 
we estimate the percentage of completion based on our estimate of the total time estimated to complete the project as a percentage of the time incurred to date 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which estimated losses are determined 
revenue for transactions through authorized resellers has been recognized when the licenses and maintenance have been resold  utilized by the reseller or our related obligations have been satisfied 
we have provided for sales allowances for authorized resellers and direct sales on an estimated basis 
this estimation has been based on prior history as well as contractual requirements 
we defer services revenue related to our subscribenet service and generally recognize it ratably over the term of the service arrangement 
we recognize revenue related to professional services as the services are completed and contractual obligations are met 
prepaid licenses we write down our prepaid licenses for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of the prepaid licenses and the estimated recoverable value based on assumptions about future demand  market conditions and our rights to return under stock rotation agreements 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional prepaid license write downs may be required 
during the year ended february  we recorded approximately  in prepaid license write downs 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we analyze specific accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
changes in the above factors can have a material impact on actual bad debts incurred 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  we are required to regularly review all of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that an impairment review is necessary based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we compare the book value of such assets to the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to those assets 
if the book value is less than the future undiscounted cash flows  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
significant judgment is required in the development of projected cash flows for these purposes including assumptions regarding the appropriate level of aggregation of cash flows  their term and discount rate as well as the underlying forecasts of expected future revenue and expense 
we recorded the write off of approximately million of intangibles in fy relating to the bitsource  inc acquisition  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we did not record any additional impairment charges relating to goodwill or intangibles in fy however  to the extent that events or circumstances cause our assumptions to change  we may be required to record additional write downs  which could be material 
income taxes in conjunction with preparing our financial statements  we must estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
given that we have incurred losses since inception and therefore  have not been required to pay income taxes  we have fully reserved our deferred tax assets at february  in the event that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period that this is determined 
results of operations total revenue revenue decreased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february   and million for the year ended february  in addition  for the year ended february   product revenue accounted for million or of revenue  compared to million or of revenue for the year ended february  and million or of revenue for the year ended february  online service and technology revenue for the year ended february  accounted for million or of revenue compared to million or of revenue for the year ended february  and million or of revenue for the year ended february  the decline in product revenue and total revenue was primarily due to our transition out of the business of reselling third party software products and related maintenance 
the decrease in online services and technology revenue is primarily due to the elimination of some of our online services and technology products that had low market acceptance in our december restructuring and a slowdown in technology spending resulting from weakened overall economic conditions 
in june  we entered into an agreement with corporate software whereby corporate software assumed our rights and obligations under our iplanet software reseller agreement  and agreed to pay to us a percentage of the gross profit derived from corporate software s sales of iplanet software licenses and services 
we expect our third party product revenue to continue to decrease substantially as a result of this agreement 
we also expect our online services and technology revenue to decrease substantially as a result of our sale of our asset management software business to computer associates international  inc in may cost of revenues total cost of revenues decreased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  and million for the year ended february  the decrease in cost of revenues primarily reflects our decrease in revenue and changes in the mix of products sold 
our gross margin increased to for the year ended february  from for the year ended february  and for the year ended february  the margin percentage increase primarily reflects our focus on the sale of our own services and technology  which generate higher margins than third party products we resold 
costs of revenue primarily consist of the cost of third party products sold  internet connectivity and certain allocated costs related to customer support and professional services personnel costs 
we purchased third party products at a discount to the third party s established list prices according to standard reseller terms 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended february   sales and marketing expenses were million or of revenue  a decrease from million or of revenue for the year ended february   and million or of revenue for the year ended february  sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  benefits and commissions  advertising  promotional materials and trade show expenses 
the decrease is due to our restructuring efforts  which reduced expenditures on salaries and marketing  eliminated rent on closed offices and lowered commission expense due to lower sales 
we plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing at levels similar to our fiscal year levels as a percentage of revenue  and to continue developing strategic relationships to sell our products and services directly to our customer base 
the previous sentence is a forward looking statement and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
product development expenses for the year ended february   product development expenses were million or of revenue  a decrease from million or of revenue for the year ended february   and a slight increase from million or of revenue for the year ended february  product development expenses primarily consist of personnel  consulting  software and related maintenance and equipment depreciation expenses 
costs related to research  design and development of products and services have been charged to product development expense as incurred 
the recent decrease is due to our current and prior year restructuring efforts  which reduced expenditures on salaries and unproven product and service lines 
we anticipate continuing to invest in additional functionality for our subscribenet service 
total expenditures are expected to approximate fiscal year levels as a percentage of revenue 
we expect product development expenses to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make incremental investments in product development 
however  we cannot give assurance that such development efforts will result in products  features or functionality or that the market will accept the products  features or functionality developed 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended february   general and administrative expenses were million or of revenue  a decrease from million or of revenue for the year ended february   and million or of revenue for the year ended february  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for administrative and executive personnel  facility costs and fees for professional services 
a significant part of our decreased general and administrative expenses stems from our restructuring efforts in december and august  which resulted in a reduction of compensation expense and lease costs for office space 
total expenditures are expected to approximate fiscal year levels as a percentage of revenue 
the previous sentence is a forward looking statement and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
december restructuring and loss on abandonment of assets on december   we announced a strategic restructuring directed toward strengthening our competitive and financial position 
this strategy involved a restructuring that reduced our total headcount to approximately  from at november  in addition  we consolidated our three san francisco bay area offices into two and reduced our number of outside sales offices from eleven to seven 
we took a charge relating to this restructuring in our fourth quarter ended february  of million 
the restructuring charges were primarily due to the following million for rent and sublease expenses  net of anticipated sublease income for office leases  and expenses related to the closure of certain offices 
million relates primarily to the abandonment of property and equipment  net of anticipated proceeds of approximately million for severance costs in connection with the termination of certain employees 
 for expenses relating to the write off of our e learning product 
 relates to other restructuring expenses 
we made cash payments of million during the year ended february  related to the restructuring charge 
at february  we had a remaining restructuring accrual of  of which  was related to future lease and related expenses and the remainder was severance costs 
as of february  we have settled all liabilities associated with the december strategic restructuring 
august restructuring and loss on abandonment of assets on august  we announced a strategic reorganization designed to accelerate our drive toward profitability and enhance our capital raising opportunities 
we recorded a charge of million relating to this restructuring and the loss on abandonment of assets during the quarter ended august  the loss on abandonment of assets includes the write off of approximately million of certain intangibles relating to the bitsource  inc acquisition as we have abandoned the related technology 
the write off consisted of the following components  for trademarks   for goodwill  and  for existing technology 
we wrote off property and equipment with net book values of approximately million 
these assets were taken out of service  as they were deemed unnecessary due to the reductions in work force 
included in this amount are certain furniture and fixtures that were written down to a net realizable value of approximately  these furniture and fixtures were taken out of service in the second quarter of fiscal and subsequently disposed of or sold 
the restructuring consisted of approximately  for severance and benefits relating to the involuntary termination of employees  all of which were based in north america 
we reduced our workforce to employees from at the end of july 
of the terminated employees  were in sales and marketing  were in product development and were in general and administrative 
we also consolidated our two san francisco bay area offices into one 
we accrued for lease and related costs of approximately million principally pertaining to the estimated future obligations of non cancelable lease payments for excess facilities in the san francisco bay area that were vacated due to the reduction in work force 
we also recognized an additional  relating to other restructuring expenses 
due to changes in management s estimates relating to the strategic reorganization on august   we recognized additional expense of approximately  during the three months ended november  this additional charge principally related to the acquisition of the title to assets held under a capital lease see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with our restructuring efforts we recorded a charge of approximately  relating to the black scholes fair value of an option issued to a consultant on september  for services performed in conjunction with exiting our excess lease space 
we issued a fully vested and immediately exercisable option to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the term of the option is ten years 
the following assumptions were used to value the option under the black scholes model term of years  fair value of the stock price on the grant date of  option exercise price of per share  volatility of  and a zero dividend yield 
we made cash payments of approximately million during the year ended february  as of february  we had settled all liabilities associated with the august restructuring 
the following table sets forth an analysis of the components of the restructuring and loss on abandonment charges recorded in the second quarter of fiscal and subsequent adjustments and payments made against the reserve in thousands severance and benefits asset write offs excess lease and related costs other costs total august  restructuring and loss on abandonment of assets total    cash paid non cash charges   reserve balance at august    cash paid non cash charges provision adjustment reserve balance at november    cash paid   reserve balance at february  merger and acquisition related costs including amortization of intangibles for the years ended february  and  merger and acquisition related costs including amortization of intangibles  were million  an increase from million for the year ended february  merger and acquisition related costs including amortization of intangibles  is a charge related to our acquisitions of bitsource  inc in october and janus technologies  inc in july and costs related to the internet image  inc merger  which was accounted for as a pooling of interest 
certain identified intangibles will cease to be amortized as a result of the adoption of sfas see recent accounting pronouncements below in this item of part ii in our fiscal year interest expense for the year ended february   interest expense was million or of revenue  an increase from  or of revenue for the year ended february   and  or of revenue for the year ended february  interest expense relates to obligations under capital leases  notes payable and borrowings under a bank line 
the increase in interest expense is primarily the result of interest expense related to our million notes payable  which are due in full on august  the carrying value of the promissory notes is million at february  and is being accreted to its redemption amount of million see note of the consolidated financial statements 
interest income and other income and expenses  net for the year ended february   interest income and other income and expenses  net was a net charge of million or of revenue  a decrease from income of  or of revenue for the year ended february   and million or of revenue for the year ended february  interest income and other income and expenses relates to interest earned on our investment balances  certain state franchise taxes and warrants disclosed as liabilities adjusted to fair value 
the decrease in interest income and other income and expenses for the year ended february  is primarily the result of a reduction in our invested cash and charges we recorded to adjust the warrants we issued in connection with our august and september  financing  which were classified as liabilities  to fair value 
the charge recorded to adjust the warrants to fair value during the year ended february  was million 
income taxes from inception through february   we incurred net losses for federal and state tax purposes and have not recognized any tax provision or benefit 
as of february   we had approximately million of federal and million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income  which expire in varying amounts between and given our limited operating history  losses incurred to date and the difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results  management does not believe that the realization of the related deferred income tax asset meets the criteria required by generally accepted accounting principles 
accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance 
furthermore  as a result of changes in our equity ownership from our convertible preferred stock financings and our initial public offering  utilization of the net operating losses and tax credits is subject to substantial annual limitations 
this is due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and tax credits before utilization 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of preferred and common stock and the initial public offering of our common stock 
as we have not yet achieved positive cash flow from our operations  we will continue to use our capital raised to date to support our operations until we become cash flow positive 
however  there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in becoming cash flow positive without additional capital financing 
our cash and cash equivalents at february  were million  decreasing by million from million at february  this decrease was due to million used in operating activities which was offset by million provided by investing activities and million provided by financing activities 
the net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended february  was primarily due to our net loss and decreases in deferred revenues and accounts payable offset by decreases in accounts receivable as well as prepaid licenses  services and cost of deferred revenue 
financing activities provided million for primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock and proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with our employee stock purchase plan and debt financings 
net cash provided by investing activities of million for related primarily to the use of our restricted cash 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our ability to increase gross profit levels and reduce costs of operations to generate positive cash flows  as well as the timing and extent of spending to support expansion of sales and marketing  market acceptance of our services and timeliness of collections of our accounts receivable 
although we have historically been able to satisfy our cash requirements  there can be no assurance that efforts to obtain sufficient financing for operations will be successful in the future 
our future capital needs will be highly dependent upon our ability to control expenses and generate additional online services revenues  and any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
our ability to raise additional capital may be weakened as a result of the recent transfer of our listing from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market 
if we are unable to generate positive cash flow in the near term or raise adequate additional capital  we may be required to aggressively reduce the scope of sales and marketing efforts and the size of current staff  both of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and our ability to reduce losses or generate profits 
while we are seeking to improve our sales and control our expenses  there can be no assurance that we will succeed in our efforts to generate sufficient cash from operations or achieve positive cash flow or profitability 
on april   we entered into an agreement to sell a new class of series b preferred stock and warrants to institutional and individual investors for aggregate gross proceeds of million  and net proceeds of million after fees and expenses 
this transaction is described in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii 
on august  and september  we issued promissory notes and warrants in a private placement to a group of institutional and individual investors for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
this transaction is described in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii 
we also repaid our line of credit of million in august on may   we completed the sale of our asset management software business for gross proceeds of million 
this transaction is described in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii 
on may   we issued common stock and warrants in a private placement to a group of institutional and individual investors for aggregate gross proceeds of million  including million from effective conversion of indebtness 
this transaction is described in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii 
in may  we fully repaid or converted into common stock and warrants to purchase common stock all of these promissory notes of million and associated accrued interest 
at february   we did not have any other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at february   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by period total long term debt   capital lease obligations    operating leases   as of february  our redeemable convertible preferred stock had a liquidation value of million 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations  and no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  collectively referred to as the standards 
sfas supersedes accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 business combination 
the provisions of sfas require that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   provide specific criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets apart from goodwill  and require that unamortized negative goodwill be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and amortized 
sfas also requires that upon adoption of sfas we reclassify the carrying amounts of certain intangible assets into or out of goodwill  based on certain criteria 
sfas supersedes apb  intangible assets  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition 
the provisions of sfas prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  require that goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles assets be tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangible assets may be impaired  require that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill  and remove the forty year limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have finite lives 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas in our first quarter ending may  we are in the process of preparing for the adoption of sfas and are making the determinations as to what our reporting units are and what amounts of goodwill  intangible assets  other assets  and liabilities should be allocated to those reporting units 
in connection with the adoption of sfas  we expect to reclassify million of intangible assets to goodwill 
we expect that we will no longer record amortization of million relating to our existing goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles  as adjusted for the reclassifications previously mentioned 
we will also evaluate the useful lives assigned to our intangible assets  however we do not anticipate changes to their useful lives 
sfas requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment and  in transition  this step must be measured as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
however  a company has six months from the date of adoption to complete the first step 
we expect to complete the first step of the goodwill impairment test during the first quarter of our fiscal year the second step of the goodwill impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss measured as of the beginning of the year of adoption  if any  and must be completed by the end of our fiscal year 
any impairment loss resulting from the transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the adoption is expected to have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position due primarily to the application of its provisions to the disposition of assets and liabilities of our asset management business see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
this statement also amends accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary 
the provisions of sfas are required to be adopted during our fiscal year beginning march   however early adoption is acceptable 
the disposition of our asset management business see note will be recognized under sfas the adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position 
in november  the fasb emerging task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products  which is a codification of eitf  and this issue presumes that consideration from a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products is a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor s products and  therefore  should be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendor s income statement and could lead to negative revenue under certain circumstances 
revenue reduction is required unless consideration relates to a separate identifiable benefit and the benefit s fair value can be established 
this issue should be applied no later than in annual or interim financial statements for periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  which includes  among other things  guidance on eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf 
eitf no 
 as it relates to eitf no 
 is to be applied for financial reporting periods beginning after december  and generally requires that a company recognize as revenue  travel expense and other reimbursable expenses billed to customers 
upon adoption in accordance with the transition guidelines of eitf no 
 all prior period amounts will be reclassified in the financial statements for comparative purposes 
we will adopt eitf during the first quarter of fiscal adoption will require us to classify reimbursements that we receive from corporate software relating to maintaining a team dedicated to sales of iplanet software licenses and maintenance from operating expenses to revenue see note of the consolidated financial statements 
all prior year amounts will be reclassified to conform to the current presentation upon adoption 
during the year ended february   we were reimbursed approximately  relating to the reimbursement of the sales team salaries 
we are currently in the process of evaluating any further impact of the adoption of eitf no 
however  the adoption of eitf no 
will not affect our basic net loss per share  financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making a decision to invest in intraware 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing intraware 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we do not currently believe are important to an investor may also harm our business operations 
if any of the events  contingencies  circumstances or conditions described in the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or our results of operations could be seriously harmed 
if that occurs  the trading price of intraware common stock could decline  and you may lose part or all of your investment 
we have negative cash flow and may not have sufficient cash to continue operations or  even if we can continue operations  to effectively manage our working capital requirements and fund our operations for the period required to achieve profitability 
this annual report on form k contains a disclosure expressing substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of our recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations 
we have limited cash and credit available  and may be unable to raise additional financing or establish additional lines of credit 
as of february   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
we may not be able to achieve the revenue and gross margin objectives necessary to achieve positive cash flow or profitability without obtaining additional financing 
such financing may not be available on reasonable terms  and if available such additional financing will dilute current shareholders 
if such financing is required and we cannot obtain it  we will have to discontinue operations 
if nasdaq determines that we have failed to meet its smallcap market listing requirements  our common stock may be delisted 
our common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
nasdaq has requirements that a company must meet in order to remain listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
one requirement is that the bid price of a company s stock not fall below the bid price of our common stock was below almost continuously between september and december  and dropped below in april and may if as a result of the application of this or any other listing requirement  our common stock were delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  our stock would become harder to buy and sell 
further  our stock could then potentially be subject to what are known as the penny stock rules  which place additional requirements on broker dealers who sell or make a market in such securities 
consequently  if we were removed from the nasdaq smallcap market  the ability or willingness of broker dealers to sell or make a market in our common stock might decline 
as a result  your ability to resell your shares of our common stock could be adversely affected 
we have a history of losses  we expect future losses and we may not ever become profitable 
we have not achieved profitability  may incur net losses through our fiscal year ending february  and may not ever become profitable in the future 
we incurred net losses attributable to common stockholders of million for the fiscal year ended february   million for the year ended february   and million for the year ended february  as of february   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we will need to generate significant additional online services and technology revenues and or reduce operating costs to achieve and maintain positive cash flow and profitability 
we have a limited operating history that makes it difficult to forecast our future operating results 
our revenues have declined in recent quarters  and we cannot be certain that we will achieve sufficient revenues or gross profits in future quarters for positive cash flow or profitability 
if we do achieve positive cash flow or profitability in any period  we cannot be certain of continued or increased positive cash flow or profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
demand for our subscribenet service remains uncertain in the current economic climate 
for most of the calendar year  we experienced weakening demand for our subscribenet service 
while there have been signs of strengthening demand for our services in the calendar year  the business climate for the technology sector remains uncertain 
several other internet service providers  as well as enterprise software companies  have reported sharp reductions in demand and lowered forecasts for their products and services over the past year 
we may experience similar reductions in demand for our products and services  which would have an immediate and adverse effect on us 
any termination of our relationship with sun microsystems or corporate software would have a substantial  adverse effect on our business 
we provide online software update and license management services to sun microsystems  inc s iplanet customers through our subscribenet and fulfillment services under an agreement that expires on june  we cannot assure you that this agreement will be extended after june  or that sun microsystems  inc won t exercise its right to terminate the agreement for convenience prior to the expiration of the term 
most of our subscribenet revenues to date have been generated through this iplanet contract  and termination of this agreement could have a material adverse effect on our subscribenet revenues and on our business as a whole 
if sun chose to offer its own electronic software delivery  tracking  maintenance or other services  which it is permitted to do under the current agreement  it would have a substantial adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
under our sales alliance agreement with corporate software dated june   we are transitioning to corporate software our reseller relationship with iplanet 
this agreement expires in june  but may terminate earlier under certain circumstances  including any termination of the reseller contract between corporate software and iplanet 
a significant portion of our subscribenet revenues since july have been generated through this corporate software contract  and a significant portion of our revenues in future periods could be generated through this contract 
any termination of this contract before june could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 
software manufacturers may not wish to use our subscribenet service as a way of outsourcing electronic delivery of their software 
our strategy for achieving profitability assumes significant revenue growth from our subscribenet service 
however  we cannot assure you that software manufacturers that are not currently our subscribenet customers will find it strategically or economically justifiable to use the subscribenet service to deliver software to their end users 
some software manufacturers are reluctant for security reasons to deliver their software via the internet or to authorize a third party to do so on their behalf 
some software manufacturers believe that they can internally develop an adequate electronic software delivery system at a cost lower than the fees we charge for subscribenet 
these and other concerns on the part of software manufacturers could make it difficult for us to quickly achieve significant growth in subscribenet revenue  which could in turn hinder our ability to achieve profitability and positive cash flow 
we are dependent on market acceptance of electronic software delivery  and if it does not achieve widespread acceptance  our business will be adversely affected 
our future success will depend in large part on broadened acceptance by information technology professionals of electronic software delivery as a method of receiving business software 
if electronic software delivery does not achieve widespread market acceptance  our business will be adversely affected 
electronic software delivery is a relatively new method of distributing software products and the growth and market acceptance of electronic software delivery is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risk factors 
these factors include the potential for state and local authorities to levy taxes on internet transactions  the unavailability of sufficient network bandwidth to enable purchasers to rapidly download software  the limited number of software packages that are available for electronic software delivery as compared to those available through traditional delivery methods  customer unfamiliarity with and resistance to the process of downloading software  and customer concerns about transaction security 
even if electronic software delivery achieves widespread acceptance  we cannot be sure that we will overcome the substantial technical challenges associated with electronically delivering software reliably and consistently on a long term basis 
furthermore  the proliferation of software viruses poses a risk to market acceptance of electronic software delivery 
any well publicized transmission of a computer virus by us or another company using electronic software delivery could deter information technology professionals from utilizing electronic software delivery technology and our business could be adversely affected 
increased security risks of online commerce may deter future use of our services 
concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of our subscribenet service 
any failure by us to prevent security breaches could significantly harm our business and results of operations 
we cannot be certain that advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other developments will not result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we use to protect our customers transaction data or our software vendors products 
anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations 
we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
any well publicized compromise of security could deter people from using the web to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential information or downloading sensitive materials 
the loss of one or more of our key customers could adversely affect our revenues 
we believe that a substantial amount of revenue from our subscribenet service in any given future period may come from a relatively small number of customers in addition to sun microsystems  as detailed above 
if one or more major customers were to stop using our services  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
our contractual relationships with most of these customers are subject to renewal annually 
as a result  we cannot assure you that any of our customers will renew their contracts with us in any given year 
our quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations because of many factors and any of these could adversely affect our stock price 
our operating results have fallen below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in the past 
it is likely that in future quarters our operating results will again be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and as a result  the price of our common stock will fall 
our operating results have varied widely in the past  and we expect that they will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of risk factors  including potential weakening of demand for our subscribenet services and iplanet products that we sell jointly with corporate software  the unwillingness of certain potential customers to purchase our services due to concerns about our financial strength  the timing of sales of our services  potential renewed cost cutting in our sales  marketing  product development and support areas  potential loss of strategic relationships with major customers and resellers  potential delays in introducing our products and services according to planned release schedules  changes in our pricing policies  caution among software companies in changes in accepting or outsourcing electronic delivery of their software  potential technical difficulties  system failures or internet downtime  potential changes in the regulatory environment  our ability to upgrade and develop our information technology systems and infrastructure  costs related to acquisitions of technology or businesses  and general economic conditions  as well as those specific to the internet and related industries 
in addition  our june agreement with corporate software  under which we are transitioning to corporate software our business of reselling iplanet software  has resulted in and will continue to result in a decrease in revenue to us 
our may sale of our asset management software business to computer associates international  inc will also result in a substantial decrease in our revenue and gross profit 
these decreases in our revenues and gross profit could affect the market price of our common stock 
our operating expenses  which include sales and marketing  product development and general and administrative expenses  are based on our expectations of future gross profits and are relatively fixed in the short term 
if gross profits fall below our expectations and we are not able to quickly reduce our spending in response  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our industry is highly competitive and we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively compete 
the market for selling online services and software is highly competitive 
we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand and improve their service offerings  new competitors enter the market  and the business market for information technology services continues to exhibit softness 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  competition on our subscribenet sales 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors  or that competitive pressures faced by us will not adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our current competitors include a number of companies offering electronic software delivery and management solutions 
we expect additional competition from other established and emerging companies 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  better name recognition  and a larger installed base of customers than we do 
many of our competitors may also have well established relationships with our existing and prospective customers 
our current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address customer needs and compete with our products 
we also expect that the competition will increase as a result of software industry consolidations 
as a result  we may not be able to effectively compete for customers 
our executive officers and certain key personnel are critical to our business and these officers and key personnel may not remain with us in the future 
our future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key technology  sales  marketing and support personnel 
none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term 
if we lost the services of one or more of our key employees  or if one or more of our executive officers or employees decided to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  this could have a significant adverse effect on our business 
in particular  the services of peter h 
jackson  chief executive officer  and frost r 
r 
prioleau  president  would be difficult to replace 
we face risks of claims from third parties for intellectual property infringement that could adversely affect our business 
we electronically deliver third party software to end users 
this activity creates the potential for claims to be made against us  either directly or through contractual indemnification provisions with software companies 
any claims could result in costly litigation and be time consuming to defend  divert management s attention and resources  cause delays in releasing new or upgrading existing services or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
these claims could be made for defamation  negligence  patent  copyright or trademark infringement  personal injury  invasion of privacy or other legal theories based on the nature  content or copying of these materials 
litigation regarding intellectual property rights is common in the internet and software industries 
we expect that internet technologies and software products and services may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
there can be no assurance that our services do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 
in addition  we may be involved in litigation involving the software of third party vendors that we have electronically distributed in the past 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful claim of infringement against us could adversely affect our business 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover all potential claims or may not be adequate to protect us from all liability that may be imposed 
we take steps to verify that end users who download third party software through our subscribenet service are entitled to deploy and use that software 
however  there can be no assurance that this verification procedure will help us defend against claims by  or protect us against liability to  the owners of copyrights in that third party software 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology  which we protect through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law 
we are aware that certain other companies are using or may have plans to use the name intraware as a company name or as a trademark or service mark 
while we have received no notice of any claims of trademark infringement from any of those companies  we cannot assure you that certain of these companies may not claim superior rights to intraware or to other marks we use 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our services or technology and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology 
our market may undergo rapid technological change and our future success will depend on our ability to meet the changing needs of our industry 
our market is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product announcements 
to be successful  we must adapt to our rapidly changing market by continually improving the performance  features and reliability of our services 
we could incur substantial costs to modify our services or infrastructure in order to adapt to these changes 
our business could be adversely affected if we incur significant costs without adequate results  or find ourselves unable to adapt rapidly to these changes 
additional government regulations may increase our costs of doing business 
in delivering third party software through our subscribenet service  and in delivering our own it asset management software  we must comply with us export controls on software generally and encryption technology in particular 
changes in these laws could require us to implement costly changes to our automated export compliance processes 
more generally  the law governing internet transactions remains largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet could adversely affect our business by increasing our costs and administrative burdens 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property  privacy  libel and taxation apply to the internet 
laws and regulations directly applicable to communications or commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent 
it appears that additional laws and regulations regarding protection of privacy on the internet will be adopted at the state and federal levels in the united states 
the european union has enacted its own data protection and privacy directive  which required all european union member states to implement laws relating to the processing and transmission of personal data 
we must comply with these new regulations in both europe and the united states  as well as any other regulations adopted by other countries where we may do business 
the growth and development of the market for online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad 
compliance with any newly adopted laws may prove difficult for us and may negatively affect our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at the end of fiscal year  we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio during fiscal we place our investments with high quality issuers  by policy  in an effort to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
at february   million of our cash  cash equivalents and investment portfolio carried maturity dates of less than days 
the effect of changes in interest rates of over a six month horizon would not have a material effect on the fair market value of the portfolio
