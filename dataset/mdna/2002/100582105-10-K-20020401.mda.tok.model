item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated results of operations the company s total revenues declined to million in from million in the decline was primarily attributable to a decline in roaming services revenue and an decline in revenues from the company s prepaid wireless services business  partially offset by a increase in prepaid systems revenue 
in  total revenues increased compared to  primarily due to a increase in prepaid wireless services revenues  partially offset by a decline in roaming service revenues and a decline in prepaid systems revenues 
the company s operating loss from continuing operations of  for the year ended december  represents a decrease from operating income of million for the year ended december  and an increase from an operating loss of million for the year ended december  the decline in prepaid wireless services revenues and roaming services revenues principally contributed to the decline in operating income from continuing operations in  while a significant increase in prepaid wireless services revenues contributed to the improvement in operating income from continuing operations in excluding the effects of the loss on impairment of long lived assets and non recurring charges  operating income from continuing operations for year ended december  and was million and million  respectively and the operating loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  was  the specifics of each segment s revenues and gross margin are discussed in greater detail below 
the company s reportable operating segments consist of prepaid wireless services  roaming services and prepaid systems 
the accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in note of the company s consolidated financial statements  except that the financial results for the company s operating segments have been prepared using a management approach 
this approach is consistent with the basis and manner in which the company s management internally analyzes financial information for the purposes of assisting in making internal operating decisions 
the company evaluates performance based on the gross margin of each stand alone business 
for segment reporting purposes  the company reports inter segment sales from the prepaid systems business to the prepaid wireless services business for v nodes and related equipment shipped during the year 
such revenues are eliminated in consolidation 
segment disclosure information is included in note of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s chief operating decision maker is its president and chief executive officer 
the company s operating segments are managed separately because each represents a strategic business unit that offers different products and serves unique markets within the wireless industry 
however  the businesses complement each other by providing the company with a strong suite of products and services to meet the needs of wireless carriers 
the company s customers include four of the six largest national wireless carriers by number of subscribers 
the company believes that any impact from inflation is not material

prepaid wireless services prepaid wireless services revenues decreased to million in from million in and increased in from million in in  the company revised its definition of subscribers to include active subscribers only eg those customers whose balances have not expired or whose accounts are expected to be reactivated  which resulted in the non recurring write down of  non performing subscribers from the base 
including the effects of writing off non performing subscribers  the company s subscriber base was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
before the write down  the company s subscriber base totaled million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
during  the lower subscribers resulted principally from the losses of rogers atandt and atandt wireless as customers  higher churn and the non recurring write down of subscribers 
the higher than expected churn and write down of non performing subscribers were principally due to the loss of legacy analog subscribers  many of whom  the company believes  switched to alternative digital prepaid or comparable products offered by both the company s carrier customers and their competitors 
it is evident that many of the company s lower usage  legacy analog subscribers that did not have the newer digital features  opted to change their service in favor of digital  feature rich prepaid plans offered by competitors of the company s customers 
although it appears that the company s carrier customers lost subscribers to competing programs  bcgi carrier customers who promoted digital  feature rich programs to the youth market were successful in generating new  higher quality subscribers  although not at a high enough rate to offset the analog losses 
these new digital subscribers have the potential to generate more long term revenue for both the carriers and the company since the robust features and offerings result in lower churn and increased usage as much as six times higher usage than their legacy analog counterparts 
thus  the company believes that its carrier customers focus on attracting higher revenue generating subscribers will result in an increase in net subscriber additions and prepaid wireless revenues in  offsetting the anticipated churn of legacy analog subscribers 
the reduction in subscribers in was the primary cause of the revenue decline that was partially offset by increased minutes of usage mou per subscriber  resulting primarily from carriers promoting more competitively priced  digital  full featured prepaid offerings 
these offerings resulted in a increase in the monthly average mou per subscriber from at the end of to at the end of including the effects of writing off non performing subscribers  the monthly average mou per subscriber was at the end of  increasing to at the end of the increase in subscribers and revenues from to was due to rapid carrier adoption of prepaid wireless programs which generated more subscribers and higher mou 
several of the company s carrier customers launched prepaid programs targeted at the credit challenged market that spurred subscriber growth in the company expects that its subscriber base  average mou and revenues will increase as existing and prospective carrier customers aggressively market the company s full featured  prepaid offerings that appeal to higher quality subscribers who tend to talk more on their prepaid phones 
the anticipated revenue growth will be tempered  however  as carriers who generate higher mou avail themselves of volume pricing discounts offered by the company 
gross margins for prepaid wireless services declined to of prepaid wireless services revenues in from of such revenues in and increased in from in the gross margins for and include non recurring charges of million and million  respectively  for legal expense accruals 
the charges for legal expenses represent the company s best estimate of fees the company has incurred and expects to incur primarily to defend the freedom wireless suit 
there can be no assurances that the company s expenses to defend the freedom wireless suit will not exceed the company s estimate 
the improvement in gross margin from to resulted from the significant increase in prepaid wireless services revenues that leveraged the predominantly fixed cost infrastructure 
although the company continued to closely manage its costs during  the predominantly fixed cost infrastructure and lower revenues resulted in lower margins for the company expects that as subscribers and mou grow  it will be able to resume leveraging its fixed costs to yield higher gross margins in roaming services roaming services revenues decreased to million in from million in and decreased in from million in the decrease in roaming services revenues was primarily attributable to consolidation in the industry  an increase in one rate registered roaming plans offered by some national carriers and advancements in handset technology that have improved registered roaming capabilities 
the company anticipates that these trends will accelerate  and therefore  roaming services revenues are expected to continue to decrease at higher rates compared to prior periods 
gross margins for roaming services decreased to of roaming services revenues in from of such revenues in and increased in from in the decrease in resulted primarily from lower revenues and the resulting lower absorption of fixed costs 
the gross margin increased slightly in due to cost management initiatives and reduced rates for vendor telecommunications costs 
although the company continues to focus on cost management initiatives  margins are anticipated to decrease as revenues decline since certain fixed costs may not be absorbed 
prepaid systems excluding inter segment revenues which are eliminated in consolidation  prepaid systems revenues increased to million in and declined from million in to million in gross prepaid systems revenues decreased to million in from million in and increased in from million in the decrease in gross prepaid systems revenues in was due to a decrease in shipments of inter segment prepaid v nodes  partially offset by increased sales of prepaid systems to external customers 
in  inter segment sales decreased as v nodes were built primarily to support growth and expansion for certain carrier customers 
sales to external customers increased as the company sold more international systems and experienced a corresponding increase in maintenance revenue 
the increase in gross prepaid systems revenues in reflects increased shipments of inter segment prepaid v nodes while external revenues remained fairly consistent 
inter segment sales were higher in due to the build out of v nodes to support verizon wireless national prepaid program 
freeup  whose contract was awarded to the company that year 
gross margins for prepaid systems  excluding inter segment revenues  decreased to of prepaid systems revenues in from of such revenues in and increased in from a negative margin in gross margins for prepaid systems  excluding inter segment revenues and the effects of non recurring charges  decreased to of systems revenues in  from in and increased in from in the decrease in principally resulted from lower inter segment revenues than  which absorbed less of the overhead in the gross margin for was reduced by a non recurring charge of  recorded in the fourth quarter of for accruals and inventory write offs resulting from the discontinuance of the company s voice mail product 
the increase in was a result of increased revenues for inter segment sales of voice nodes in addition to increased recurring service revenues that yield a higher margin 
the gross margin in was reduced by a non recurring charge of million  recorded in the third quarter of for the reorganization of the prepaid systems business 
the charge principally related to expenses associated with inventory write downs to bring the level of inventory in line with the future sales strategy  as well as severance costs 
the company currently prices and sells all of its systems to international customers in us dollars 
all payments are received in us dollars  which minimizes the company s need to hedge against foreign currency risk

engineering  research and development expenses were  and of total revenues for the years ended december   and the increases in and primarily resulted from additional resources devoted to expanding and enhancing the features and functionality of the company s ivsn and transaction processing platform  in addition to resources devoted to the company s m commerce initiatives 
the company intends to continue to increase its engineering  research and development expenditures to support ongoing and future development and enhancements of its prepaid and other wireless services and systems 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses include direct sales and product management salaries  commissions  travel and entertainment expenses  in addition to the cost of trade shows  direct mail and other promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses remained consistent at of total revenues for the years ended december  and sales and marketing expenses decreased to from for the years ended december  and  respectively  due to the reorganization of the company s sales organization into one group to centralize efforts and leverage resources general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits of employees and other expenses that provide administrative support to the company 
total general and administrative expenses remained consistent at of total revenues for the years ended december  and general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues to in from in the decrease resulted from the ability of the company to leverage its existing workforce and cost infrastructure to support increased revenues 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of telecommunications systems  furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements 
the company provides for depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from three to twenty years 
goodwill related to acquisitions is amortized over eight years 
depreciation and amortization expense remained consistent at of total revenues in and and increased from of total revenues for the year ended december  the increase from to was due primarily to the depreciation of additional technical equipment and software to support the rapid expansion and enhancement of the company s ivsn and transaction processing platform 
in addition  the increase for included million of additional depreciation recorded to write off certain equipment no longer being used to support the company s operations 
the company expects that depreciation and amortization will increase in  as more capital is deployed to support the anticipated growth in prepaid wireless services and its investment in new real time features and functionality 
impairment of long lived assets the company recognized pre tax charges of  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the charge for was related to the write down of hardware and software no longer used in the company s prepaid systems business as a result of the discontinuance of its voice mail system product 
the charge for was related to the write down of equipment no longer being used to support the company s prepaid wireless services operation  as such assets were not expected to generate any additional cash flows 
interest income  net interest income increased to million in from million in and  in the year ended december  interest income was earned primarily from investments  as well as from the cash generated from operations  the sale of the teleservices business and the proceeds from the company s public offerings 
the increased cash generated from operations and the sale of teleservices business yielded additional interest income in that was partially offset by lower interest rates in the marketplace 
although the company expects to continue to generate cash from operations in  lower interest rates compared to are expected to result in a decrease in interest income in other expense a non recurring charge of  for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the permanent impairment of a cost based investment 
provision benefit for income taxes the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was  which approximates the statutory rate 
the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was principally due to the reversal of valuation allowance resulting from the company s utilization of net operating losses in the income tax benefit of  or of the loss for the year ended december  was less than the statutory rate as the company did not provide any additional benefit for the net operating losses generated along with the non deductibility of goodwill 
income from discontinued operations the company s teleservices business  consisting primarily of a customer service call center operation  was sold to teletech holdings  inc on november  for million including the assumption of certain liabilities 
the sale was reported as a discontinued operation in and income from discontinued operations increased from  in to million in the increase in income in was primarily due to the streamlining of operations and cost management improvements associated with the closing of the company s woburn call center in the gain on disposal of the teleservices business was million  net of income taxes of million

the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including the timing of the introduction or acceptance of new services offered by the company or its competitors  seasonality  changes in the mix of services provided by the company  changes in regulations affecting the wireless industry  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  and general economic conditions 
the timing of carrier contract renewals  the rate at which carriers add prepaid subscribers  if any  mou pricing  average mou per subscriber  outages and subscriber churn levels can also impact prepaid wireless service revenues 
the company s roaming services revenues are affected by the frequency and volume of use of the company s service  which may also be influenced by seasonal trends 
the timing of orders and the number of large prepaid systems shipped during a particular quarter may fluctuate based upon the needs of the systems business customers and can have a significant impact on the level of revenues for the systems business 
because a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are committed in advance  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  unexpected revenue shortfalls could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of likely future performance 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of those financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  legal expenses  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies to be critical in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition the company earns prepaid wireless services revenues by processing prepaid wireless minutes and earns roaming services revenues by processing wireless calls for unregistered wireless subscribers who have roamed outside of their service area 
these revenues are recognized when the service is provided 
roaming services revenues are recorded net of amounts that are estimated to be disputed by unregistered wireless subscribers 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of systems at the time the systems are shipped  depending on shipping terms 
installation revenue is deferred until the entire installation is complete 
maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized over the term of the related maintenance agreement 
legal costs the company accrues costs of settlements  damages and  under certain conditions  costs of defense when such costs are probable and estimable  otherwise  such costs are expensed as incurred 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has accrued its best estimate of the probable cost of current litigation 
the estimate has been developed in consultation with the company s outside counsel who is handling the case 
there can be no assurances that the company s expenses will not exceed the company s estimate 
research and development  software development costs and costs capitalized for internal use research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred 
however  costs incurred for the development of computer software or deployment of assets for internal use are capitalized 
the direct labor and related overhead costs of development of computer software are capitalized when technological feasibility has been established 
the direct labor  travel and related overhead costs to deploy assets for internal use are capitalized until the asset is placed in service 
the capitalized costs are subject to an ongoing assessment of recoverability based on anticipated future undiscounted net cash flows and changes in hardware and software technologies 
amortization of capitalized software development costs begin when the product is made available for general release and amortization of internal use costs begins when the related asset is first placed in service 
these costs are amortized on a straight line basis over a three year period 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets to assess the recoverability of these assets in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company records impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired  and the undiscounted operating cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values 
fair value is determined by either quoted market prices or the discounted cash flow method  whichever is more appropriate under the circumstances involved 
allowance for bad debts the company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filings  substantial downgrading of credit scores  the company records a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
for all other customers  the company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due and on historical experience 
if circumstances change eg higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  the company s estimates of the recoverability of amounts could be adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased to million in from million in due to improved cash flow from operations resulting from the factors described below 
net cash provided by operations of million in resulted from  in net income from continuing operations along with adjustments for depreciation and amortization of million and non recurring charges of million 
increased collections of accounts receivable generated million of cash 
the company does not anticipate a similar increase in in addition  the company s accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased million due to the timing of payments  net of non recurring charges 
the company s investing activities utilized million of net cash in the company purchased capital equipment and software of million in for telecommunications systems equipment and software for expansion of the company s ivsn and transaction processing platform 
the company also purchased million in short term investments  net of sales 
the company anticipates that over the next months it will continue to make significant capital investments from cash flow anticipated to be generated from operations or the company s short term investments for additional equipment and enhanced feature capabilities to strengthen its prepaid wireless services and other enhanced services 
the company s financing activities provided cash of  in  including proceeds of million from the exercise of options and issuance of common stock  net of million in capital lease repayments 
under the share repurchase program announced in january the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to million shares 
the company anticipates utilizing some its short term investments to repurchase treasury shares in the company believes that its short term investments and the funds anticipated to be generated from operations will be sufficient to finance the company s operations for at least the next months 
the company has capital leases and non cancelable operating lease commitments for office space and equipment  many of which are renewable at the company s option 
future minimum payments under non cancelable capital leases and operating leases are as follows in thousands year ending december  capital leases operating leases and beyond total minimum lease payments  certain factors that may affect future results historically  a significant portion of the company s revenues in any particular period has been attributable to a limited number of customers 
this concentration of customers can cause the company s revenues and earnings to fluctuate from quarter to quarter  based on the volume of minutes of usage generated and the rates per minute paid to the company by these customers 
a loss of business from any of the company s major customers  including a decrease in business due to factors outside the company s control  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain prepaid wireless services contracts will expire in and beyond 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in renewing any of these contracts 
many wireless carriers are also providing  or can provide in house  the services that the company offers or similar services that are marketed to the same consumer base as the company s services 
if any of these contracts are not renewed  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
also  when and if each of the contracts is renewed  some contractual rates per minute will likely be lower than in previous years 
if subscriber levels and minutes of usage decline  revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected due to these lower rates 
these contracts are not exclusive and therefore do not prevent the company s customers from using competitors prepaid platforms 
two of the company s former customers  atandt wireless and rogers atandt wireless  did not renew their prepaid contracts and brought their prepaid programs in house 
there can be no assurances that other customers will not follow suit and elect not to use the company s services to offer prepaid wireless services and the company may not be able to replace these revenues 
furthermore  the company has expended significant amounts of capital to support the agreements it has secured with its carrier customers 
because prepaid wireless services revenues are principally generated by prepaid subscriber minutes of use  the company s revenues can be impacted by the ability of carriers to successfully market and sell prepaid services and the timing of when such carriers promote prepaid services 
revenues from the company s prepaid wireless services business are dependent on the company s ability to retain subscribers on the network and generate additional minutes of usage 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s churn rate percentage of total subscribers that terminate service on the network will not increase 
any such increase could result in reductions in related subscribers and therefore revenues 
the company is currently devoting significant resources toward the support and enhancement of its prepaid wireless services and systems to enhance system reliability and expand its ivsn and hosting environment 
the company has experienced network outages that have resulted in reductions in revenue due to penalty clauses contained in certain of the company s carrier customer contracts 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully support and enhance its ivsn and transaction processing platform effectively to avoid system outages and any associated loss in revenue or damage to the company s reputation 
nor can there be any assurances that the market for the company s prepaid wireless services will continue to develop  or that the company s ivsn and transaction processing platform will successfully support current and future growth 
if the company is not successful in supporting current and future growth  if the market for the company s prepaid wireless services does not continue to develop or if outages intensify either in frequency or duration  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
on november  the company sold the assets of its teleservices business to teletech holdings  inc for million including the assumption of certain liabilities  with potential additional cash payments to the company of up to million through  based upon achievement of predetermined revenue targets 
in  the teleservices business did not achieve the predetermined revenue targets nor did the company earn any additional cash payments 
there can be no assurances that the teleservices business will be successful in meeting the predetermined revenue targets to help the company earn any of the remaining potential cash payments available 
the company continues to invest in new features and additional technologies including bcgi wireless wallet m commerce  short message service sms billing  the dtpp program and other new applications to expand its prepaid wireless services business 
there can be no assurances that there will be a market for these technologies  that the company will be successful in marketing and selling these technologies in the marketplace or that the company will be able to leverage its existing infrastructure to provide these services in a cost effective manner 
in addition  the failure of any of these features or technologies may result in asset impairment charges or other write offs that could materially and adversely affect the company s overall business  operating results and financial condition 
the company has experienced fluctuations in its quarterly operating results and such fluctuations may continue and could intensify 
the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors including variations in prepaid subscriber additions  prepaid subscriber churn  customer rates per minute and minutes of use  the timing of the introduction or acceptance of new services offered by the company or its competitors  changes in the mix of services provided by the company  the loss of customers  seasonal trends  network outages  variations in the level of system sales  changes in the company s operating expenses  the ability to identify  hire and retain qualified personnel and general economic conditions 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that in some future quarter the company s results of operations will be below prior results or the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
the company historically has provided its services almost exclusively to wireless carriers 
although the wireless telecommunications market has experienced growth in recent years these growth rates have recently slowed 
there can be no assurance that wireless carriers will adopt prepaid programs including the company s prepaid wireless services offering or that wireless carriers will continue to use the company s services 
in addition  prepaid wireless services are relatively new services in new markets 
if the growth in prepaid wireless services does not materialize as expected or if the carriers in these markets do not use the company s services  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
the company expects that demand for its roaming services will continue to decline as consolidation in the wireless industry reduces the number of unregistered roamers  as carriers offer more national one rate roaming plans and as handset technology continues to improve registered roaming capabilities 
although the company has been successful in reducing costs to support roaming services and maintaining profitability  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in reducing costs at a greater rate than the decline in revenue going forward 
the company s future success depends  in large part  on the continued use of its existing services and systems  the acceptance of new services in the wireless industry and the company s ability to develop new services and systems or adapt existing services or systems to keep pace with changes in the wireless industry 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing or marketing its existing or future service offerings or systems in a timely manner  or at all 
furthermore  a rapid shift away from the use of wireless services in favor of other services could offset demand for the company s service offerings and could require the company to develop modified or alternative service offerings to address the particular needs of the providers of such new services 
the company has expanded its operations rapidly  creating significant demands on the company s management  administrative  operational  development and financial personnel and other resources 
additional expansion by the company may further strain the company s management  financial and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures  controls and existing space will be adequate to support expansion of the company s operations 
if the company s management is unable to manage operational changes effectively  the quality of the company s services  its ability to retain key personnel and its business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the company s operations are supported by many hardware components and software applications from third party vendors  sometimes licensed from single vendors 
there can be no assurances that these hardware components and software applications will function in accordance with specifications agreed upon by the company and its vendors  that these suppliers will continue to license this software to the company or  if any supplier terminates its agreement with the company  that the company will be able to develop or otherwise procure software from another supplier on a timely basis and at commercially acceptable prices 
if the hardware and software do not function as specified or if the company can no longer license software from certain vendors or otherwise obtain the software  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the company currently prices and sells all of its prepaid systems to international customers in us dollars 
in addition  many prepaid systems customers are multinational corporations that are publicly traded in the us or the united kingdom 
all payments are received in us dollars which protects the company from foreign currency fluctuations 
while these provisions serve to protect the company from accounts receivable losses  there can be no assurances that prepaid systems sales to foreign countries will not result in losses due to devaluation of foreign currencies or other international business conditions outside of the company s control 
in addition  under the current economic conditions  many corporations are reducing their capital budgets dramatically 
any such reductions in the capital budgets of the company s customers could reduce demand for the company s prepaid systems offerings 
the market for services to wireless carriers is highly competitive and subject to rapid change as new technologies are continually introduced in the wireless marketplace 
a number of companies currently offer one or more of the services offered by the company 
many wireless carriers are also providing  or can provide in house  the services that the company offers or similar services that are marketed to the same consumer base as the company s services 
in addition  the company anticipates continued growth and competition in the wireless carrier services industry and  consequently  the entrance of new competitors in the future 
an important factor in the future success of the company s prepaid wireless services will be the company s ability to provide  at competitive prices  more functionality and features than those typically available in other competitive offerings 
an increase in competition or the inability of the company to provide  at competitive prices  more functionality and features  could result in price reductions and loss of market share and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  if the company does not continue to upgrade its software and hosting environment as new wireless technologies evolve  including g and g technologies  the company could risk the loss of existing and prospective customers 
the company s success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon its proprietary technology and its ability to protect such technology 
the company continues to defend its proprietary technology against patent infringement litigation  including the freedom wireless lawsuit 
there can be no assurances that the company s expenses to defend the freedom wireless suit will not exceed the company s estimate 
also  if patent infringement judgments are entered against the company or unauthorized copying or misuse of the company s technology were to occur to any substantial degree  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company has a number of patents pending to protect its proprietary technology in the united states and internationally 
if these patents are not approved  the company s technology may not be protected from infringement by third parties and the company may be subject to additional patent infringement lawsuits or royalty payments to use the technology  which could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s operations are dependent on its ability to maintain its computer  switching and other telecommunications equipment and systems in effective working order and to protect its systems against damage from fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure  computer viruses or similar events 
although the company has built redundancy into its network with its waltham  massachusetts second data processing site and other redundant features  there are still parts of the network that are not redundant at this time 
in addition  the waltham site may not protect the company from a natural disaster within the greater boston  massachusetts area 
any damage  failure or delay that causes interruptions in the company s operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
proposals to intensify or reduce government regulations continue to be discussed at both the federal and state levels 
such changes may decrease the growth of the wireless telephone industry  result in new competitors or industry consolidation  limit the number of potential customers for the company s services or impede the company s ability to offer competitive services to the wireless market or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company maintains an investment portfolio in accordance with its investment policy 
the primary objectives of its investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
although the company s investments are subject to credit risk  the company s investment policy specifies credit quality standards for its investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
while the company s investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase  the company typically holds all of its investments until maturity 
however  since the investments are typically held to maturity and are generally conservative in nature and of relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
the company does not own derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the interest rates on the company s capital lease obligations are fixed and therefore not subject to interest rate risk 
the company currently prices and sells all of its systems to international customers in us dollars 
in addition  many of the systems business customers are multinational corporations  which are publicly traded in the us all payments are received in us dollars  which minimizes the company s need to hedge against foreign currency risk 
while these provisions serve to protect the company from accounts receivable losses  there can be no assurances that systems sales to foreign countries will not result in losses due to devaluation of foreign currencies or other international business conditions outside of the company s control 
accordingly  the company does not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments which would require disclosure under this item
