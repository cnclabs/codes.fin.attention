critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  restructuring  pensions and other post retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we derive our revenues from advertising and non advertising sources 

table of contents advertising revenues are derived principally from advertising and sponsorship arrangements 
in our advertising contracts we typically guarantee a minimum number of impressions or pages to be delivered to users over a specified period of time for a fixed fee 
advertising revenues are recognized on the basis of the number of impressions delivered or ratably over the period in which the advertising is displayed  whichever amount is lower  when the collectibility is reasonably assured 
to the extent that minimum guaranteed impressions deliveries are not met  we defer recognition of the corresponding revenues until the guaranteed impressions deliveries are achieved 
sponsorship arrangements typically allow advertisers to sponsor a particular area on our network in exchange for a fixed payment over the contract period 
advertising revenues are recognized ratably over the period of sponsorship 
advertising revenues derived from the design  coordination and integration of advertising campaigns and sponsorship to be placed on our web sites are recognized ratably over the term of such programs 
revenue from barter transactions is recognized during the period in which the advertisements are displayed in our properties 
barter transactions are recorded at the lower of the fair value of the goods or services received or the fair value of the advertisement given  provided the fair value of the transaction is reliably measurable 
non advertising revenues are derived from proprietary software products and licenses  e commerce and other fee based services 
revenue from the sale of software products is recognized primarily on the delivery of software products to end users  resellers  distributors  retail merchants and original equipment manufacturers 
we deliver our software products in packaged form or under software licenses 
revenues from sales of software products in the packaged form are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  shipment is made and collectibility is reasonably assured 
software license agreements are non refundable and allow the oem partners to reproduce our software products for a specified period of time for a fixed fee or a specified number of copies for a predetermined unit price 
revenues from software license agreements are recognized upon delivery of a master copy when the fixed fee agreements become effective or based upon activity reports provided by the oem partners under the per copy arrangements 
provision is made for expected sales returns and allowances when revenue is recognized 
payments received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
we recognize revenues in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop these statements generally require revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of the elements 
our software product agreements do not involve multiple elements 
e commerce revenues are derived principally from slotting fees charged to merchants for selective positioning and promoting their goods or services within our online mall  sinamall  and from commissions calculated as a percentage of the online sales transaction value of the merchants 
slotting fee revenue is recognized ratably over the period the products are shown on our web site while the commission revenue is recognized on a net basis after both successful on line verification of customers credit cards and shipment of products 
product returns have not been significant and are assumed by vendors 
fee based services revenues mainly include wireless short messaging  subscription services and paid email services 
revenues are recognized in the period in which the service is performed  provided that no significant company obligations remain and collection of the receivables is reasonably assured 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  the recognition of these revenues is partly based on our assessment of the probability of collection of the resulting accounts receivable balance 
as a result  the timing or amount of revenue recognition may have been different if different assessments of the probability of collection of accounts receivable had been made at the time the transactions were recorded in revenue 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be recognized as income in the period such determination was made 
we hold equity interest in a publicly traded company listed overseas 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is considered to be other than temporary 
we monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment  market conditions and the operational performances and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment 
future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future

we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operating activities  capital expenditures and other obligations for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may sell additional equities or obtain credit facilities to enhance our liquidity position 
the sale of additional equity would result in further dilution to our shareholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could result in operating covenants that would restrict our operations 
we cannot assure that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
there are uncertainties regarding the legal basis of our ability to operate an internet business and to advertise in china 
although the country has implemented a wide range of market oriented economic reforms  the telecommunication  information and media industries remain highly regulated 
not only are restrictions currently in place  but also regulations are unclear regarding in what specific segments of these industries companies with foreign investors  including us  may operate 
therefore  we might be required to limit the scope of our operations in china  and this could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we are involved in certain lawsuits in the normal course of our business operations in china  and we do not expect that the outcome of these lawsuits will have material impact on our financial positions or results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these standards change the accounting for business combinations by  among other things  prohibiting the prospective use of pooling of interests accounting and requiring companies to stop amortizing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets created by business combinations accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
instead  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will be subject to an annual review for impairment and will be written down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets exceed their fair values 
we adopted these new statements to account for our business combinations completed subsequent to june  the adoption of these pronouncements did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is required to be applied starting with years beginning after december  sfas no 
requires  amongst other things  the application model for long lived assets that are impaired or to be 
table of contents disposed of by sale 
we adopted this statement during the fiscal year ending june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our investment policy limits our investments of excess cash to government or quasi government securities and in high quality corporate securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
due to the fact that majority of our investments are in short term instruments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure in this area 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the majority of our revenues derived and expenses and liabilities incurred were in chinese renminbi  taiwan dollars and hong kong dollars 
thus  our revenues and operating results may be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations in the currencies of china  taiwan and hong kong 
see risk factors currency fluctuations and restrictions on currency exchange may adversely affect our business  including limiting our ability to convert chinese renminbi into foreign currencies and  if renminbi were to decline in value  reducing our revenue in us dollar terms 
we have not tried to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by using hedging transactions 
however  we may choose to do so in the future 
we may not be able to do this successfully 
accordingly  we may experience economic losses and negative impacts on earnings and equity as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the foreign subsidiaries and the underlying exposures described above 
as of june  and  the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
investment risk on september   we acquired an approximately interest in the equity of sun tv  a satellite tv broadcaster and a cable tv program syndicator listed on the hong kong stock exchange 
as of june   our interest was diluted to after the issuances of new shares by sun tv 
we have invested in this company for business and strategic purposes and have classified this investment as a long term investment  which is accounted for using the equity method 
accordingly  the operations of sun tv may have a material non cash impact on our operating results in future periods
