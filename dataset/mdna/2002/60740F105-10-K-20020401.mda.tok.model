item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those described under item  description of business factors that may affect future operating results and included in other portions of this report 
overview in  we transitioned our business to focus on the leasing of portable storage units rather than their sale 
this has caused the composition of our revenues and expenses to change 
leasing revenues as a percentage of our total revenues increased to in  from in  in  in  in and in the number of portable storage and office units in our lease fleet increased from  at the end of to  at the end of  representing a cagr of 
our leasing revenues include all rent and ancillary revenues we receive for our portable storage and portable office units 
our sales revenues include sales of portable storage units and portable offices to customers 
our other revenues consist principally of charges for the delivery of the portable storage units we sell 
our principal operating expenses are cost of sales  leasing  selling and general expenses  and depreciation and amortization  primarily depreciation of the portable storage units in our lease fleet 
cost of sales includes both our cost to buy  transport  refurbish and modify used ocean going containers and our cost to manufacture portable storage units and other structures 
leasing  selling and general expenses include advertising and other marketing expenses  commissions and corporate overhead for both our leasing and sales activities 
annual repair and maintenance expenses on our leased units have averaged approximately of lease revenues and are included in leasing  selling and general expenses 
we expense our normal repair and maintenance costs as incurred including the cost of periodically repainting units 
our lease fleet units are depreciated on the straight line method over our units estimated useful life  in most cases years after the date that we put the unit in service  with estimated residual values of on steel units and on wood office units 
van trailers  which are a small part of our fleet  are depreciated over years to a residual value 
van trailers  which are only added to the fleet in connection with acquisitions of portable storage businesses  are of much lower quality than storage containers and consequently depreciate more rapidly 
we believe that over time the use of van trailers for portable storage is becoming less desirable and will only be used for dock height storage and by those who must frequently move their storage units 

table of contents results of operations the following table shows the percentage of total revenues represented by the key items that make up our statements of operations year ended december  revenues leasing sales other total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales leasing  selling and general expenses depreciation and amortization income from operations other expense interest expense income before provision for income taxes and extraordinary item provision for income taxes income before extraordinary item extraordinary item and preferred stock dividend net income available to common stockholders compared to total revenues in increased by million  or  to million from million in leasing revenues in increased by million  or  to million from million in this increase resulted from a increase in the average number of portable storage units on lease and a increase in the average rent per unit 
in  our internal growth rate was approximately 
we define internal growth as the growth in revenues in markets open one year or longer  excluding any revenues from operations acquired at locations in which we are already doing business 
our revenues from the sale of units increased by million  or  to million in from million in cost of sales is associated only with the cost of units that we sold during this comparative period 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million in from million in cost of sales  as a percentage of sales revenues  increased to in from in this slight reduction in sales margins is not significant and not attributable to any particular factors 
gross margins in were more in line with margins in and leasing  selling and general expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in leasing  selling and general expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  was constant at in both and these expenses as a percentage of total revenues declined at older branches  as we were able to benefit from economies of scale as those branches grew 
this was offset by higher leasing  selling and general expenses as a percentage of total revenues at newer branches 
in general  new branches initially have lower operating margins until their fixed operating costs are covered by higher leasing volumes that typically are not achieved until the branch has been operated for several years 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to our larger lease fleet  including mobile offices which depreciate at a faster rate than our steel storage containers  additional transportation and manufacturing equipment and amortization of goodwill associated with acquisitions completed in the first half of interest expense increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily the result of higher average debt outstanding during our average debt outstanding increased by  due to an additional borrowing under our credit facility to fund the growth of our business 
during  the largest portion of our growth was funded by net proceeds of million from a public equity offering in march and by million of cash generated from

we used some additional debt financing primarily to expand our lease fleet and fund our branch expansion 
the weighted average interest rate on our debt decreased to in from in  excluding amortization of debt issuance costs

the increase in net income as a percentage of revenues was also caused in part by million of net proceeds from an equity offering in march  the proceeds were used to reduce debt  thereby reducing interest expense 
compared to total revenues in increased by million  or  to million from million in leasing revenues in increased by million  or  to million from million in this increase resulted from a increase in the average number of portable storage units on lease  partially offset by a decrease in the average rent per unit

our revenues from the sale of units increased by million  or  to million in from million in cost of sales increased by million  or  to million in from million in cost of sales  as a percentage of sales revenues  decreased to in from in this reduction was primarily the result of lower per unit manufacturing and refurbishment costs of units sold 
leasing  selling and general expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in leasing  selling and general expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in from in the increase in leasing related expenses as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to the million of expenses associated with the ten branches we added in and higher commissions related to higher leasing volume 
in general  new branches initially have lower profit margins until the branches fixed operating costs are covered by higher leasing volumes 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to our larger lease fleet  additional manufacturing equipment and amortization of goodwill associated with our acquisitions 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily the result of higher average debt outstanding during our average debt outstanding increased by  due to an additional million of borrowings under our credit facility 
we used this debt financing primarily to expand our lease fleet and fund our branch expansion 
the weighted average interest rate on our debt increased to in from in  excluding amortization of debt issuance costs 
including amortization of debt issuance costs  the weighted average interest rate was in and in provision for income taxes was based on an annual effective tax rate of for and for  decreasing as a result of the generation of income from different states 
net income increased by million  or  to million in from million in net income as a percentage of total revenues increased to in from in the increase in net income primarily resulted from our higher leasing revenues in and the decrease in leasing  selling and general expenses per unit on lease in during  we recorded an extraordinary charge of million net of an income tax benefit  in connection with the early extinguishment of million of our senior subordinated notes  which were originally scheduled to mature in november liquidity and capital resources growing our lease fleet is very capital intensive  and the amount of capital we need at any particular time is dependent principally upon the extent of growth of our lease fleet that we have targeted 
we have financed the growth of our lease fleet and our higher working capital requirements through cash flows from operations  proceeds from equity financings and borrowings under our credit 
table of contents facility 
operating activities 
our operations provided net cash flow of million in  million in and million in cash flow provided by income before depreciation  amortization and deferred income taxes increased by million to million in  compared to million in the growth of our business during recent years has required us to use more cash to support higher levels of accounts receivable and inventory  all of which have grown in conjunction with the expansion of our operations at both our existing and our new branch locations 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in this increasing use of cash resulted primarily from higher levels of capital expenditures for lease fleet and branch expansion 
capital expenditures for our lease fleet were million in  million in and million in capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million in  million in and million in in addition  we spent million in  million in and million including million of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock in for acquisitions 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in during  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily provided by our sale of approximately million shares of common stock in march  which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
during  net cash provided by financing activities was provided by our credit facility  which we used to expand our lease fleet and finance our branch expansion 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily from our public offering of approximately million shares of common stock which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
at the end of december   we had a credit facility with a group of lenders that would have matured in march this facility consisted of a million revolving line of credit and a million term loan 
on february   we refinanced the outstanding obligations under that credit facility with a group of lenders that provided a five year million revolving credit facility 
our principal source of liquidity continues to be our credit facility 
the interest rate under our new credit facility is based on our quarterly ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  similar to our previous credit agreement 
during  the average interest rate under the old credit facility was  including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements 
as of march  we had million of outstanding borrowings under our new million credit facility and approximately million of additional borrowings were available to us under the facility 
the initial borrowing rate under the new facility is the libor rate plus 
borrowings available under the new credit facility are based on our portable storage unit lease fleet  property  plant  equipment  and levels of inventories and receivables 
our lease fleet is appraised at least annually for purposes of the credit facility and any significant decline in the appraised value would have an adverse effect on our borrowing capacity under the facility 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements under which we have effectively fixed  for a three year period  the interest rate payable on an aggregate of million of borrowings under our credit facility so that the rate on million of that debt is based upon a spread from fixed rates  rather than a spread from libor 
under these agreements  we have effectively fixed  for a three year period expiring in february  the interest rate payable on million  million and million of borrowings under our revolving line of credit so that the rate is based upon a spread from  and  respectively  rather than a spread from the libor rate 
we believe that our working capital  together with our cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and other available funding sources will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned growth for at least months 
if our operations were to generate less cash than we foresee  and if we for any reason lost our ability to borrow additional funds under the credit agreement  the principal effect on our business would be to limit our ability to grow our lease fleet beyond the level at which it stood at that time 
seasonality demand from some of our customers is somewhat seasonal 
demand for leases of our portable storage units by large retailers is stronger from september through december because these retailers need to store more inventory for the holiday season 
our retail customers usually return these leased units to us early in the following year 
this has caused lower utilization rates for our lease fleet and a marginal decrease in cash flow during the first quarter of the past several years 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we seek to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates through a financial arrangement intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility 
we continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged 
interest rate swap agreements are the only instruments we use to manage interest rate fluctuations affecting our variable rate debt 
at december   we had three outstanding interest rate swap agreements under which we pay a fixed rate and receive a variable interest rate on million of debt 
in accordance with sfas no 
we recorded a million charge to comprehensive income  net of applicable income tax benefit of million  related to the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements
