critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on expected or known trends or events  historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop  and sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
sop requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists via a valid executed customer order and or signed license agreement  physical or electronic delivery has occurred including availability of license keys or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable representing amounts that are due unconditionally with no future obligations under customary payment terms  and collectibility is probable 
in the event that the company is unable to meet any one or all of the above criteria on a timely basis  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
account receivable and bad debt the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company generally invoices the customer in the same local currency as to be paid by the customer 
the company does not hedge its foreign customer receivables due to the relatively small exposure from foreign currency rate fluctuations 
capitalized software development costs the company s policy for capitalized software development costs is to capitalize eligible research  design  and development costs relating to its software products incurred between the time that the product s technological feasibility is established and the general release of the product to customers 
this policy requires management to use professional judgment in determining what development costs are eligible and at what point technological feasibility has been reached 
capitalized software development costs are amortized as a cost of software license revenue over the estimated product life  and development costs not capitalized under the policy are classified as a development expense in the same period as incurred 
if management determines that the recoverability of these unamortized capitalized software costs is not probable  these costs may require adjustment to their net realizable value  which could affect the results of the reporting period 

table of contents accounting for cost based investments the company has two cost based investments  which had a zero value at december  in assessing potential impairment for cost based investments  the company considers various factors including but not limited to investees financial performance  anticipated funding needs  comparable companies performance  and volatility inherent in the external market for these investments 
if these factors are not supportive of the carrying value of the investment  the company may record impairment charges not previously recognized to reflect management s best estimate of recoverability 
with the divestment of its vistasource business unit  the company retained a cost based investment in real time international  inc that was deemed to have no value at the date of the transaction 
the company also has a cost based investment in turbolinux  inc  which was determined to be impaired  resulting in recognition of a  impairment loss in goodwill and other intangible assets and related impairment during  the company completed its acquisition of dynamic decisions and recorded goodwill in the amount of  associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and identifiable intangible assets of  assigned to identified customer relationships 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in connection with the acquisition were based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the fair values were determined by the company s management  based in part upon information supplied by the management of the acquired business and a valuation prepared by an independent appraiser 
the valuation of identified customer relationships has been based primarily upon future cash flow projections discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors including legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of its acquired businesses to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
in addition  the estimated lives of goodwill and other intangible assets are based on current facts 
if events change  and the company has overestimated the economic life of these assets  the company will begin to amortize the remaining unamortized carrying value of these assets over the newly estimated life  which may result in additional amortization expense 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and is now required to analyze its goodwill for impairment during the first six months of fiscal  and subsequently on an annual basis thereafter  unless facts or circumstances arise earlier which indicate impairment 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on financial condition and results of operations 
during the year ended december   the company did not record any impairment losses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
restructuring during  the company recorded significant charges in connection with its restructuring programs 
these charges include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations resulting from the company s actions 
although the company does not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates  which would result in adjustments to the original estimates 
deferred taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for income taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
fas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
at december  and  the company s deferred tax asset was fully reserved 
in the event the company were to determine in the future that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made

table of contents risk factors our stock price may be adversely affected by significant fluctuations in our quarterly results 
we expect to experience significant fluctuations in our future results of operations due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control  including demand for and market acceptance of our products and services  the size and timing of customer orders  particularly large orders  some of which represent more than of total revenue during a particular quarter  introduction of products and services or enhancements by us and our competitors  competitive factors that affect our pricing  the mix of products and services we sell  the hiring and retention of key personnel  our expansion into international markets  the timing and magnitude of our capital expenditures  including costs relating to the expansion of our operations  changes in generally accepted accounting policies  especially those related to the recognition of software revenue  and new government legislation or regulation 
we typically receive a majority of our orders in the last month of each fiscal quarter because our customers often delay purchases of products until the end of the quarter and our sales organization and our individual sales representatives strive to meet quarterly sales targets 
as a result  any delay in anticipated sales is likely to result in the deferral of the associated revenue beyond the end of a particular quarter  which would have a significant effect on our operating results for that quarter 
in addition  most of our operating expenses do not vary directly with net sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term 
as a result  if net sales for a particular quarter were below expectations  we could not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter  and  therefore  that revenue shortfall would have a disproportionate adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter 
if our operating results are below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the price of our common stock may fall significantly 
our future success is dependent in large part on the success of applix integra we have devoted a substantial amount of resources to the development and marketing of our new applix integra product 
we believe that our future financial performance will be dependent in large part on the success of applix integra 
because applix integra has been announced only recently and has not yet begun commercial shipments  we cannot yet assess its market acceptance or predict with accuracy the amount of revenue it will generate 
if we do not introduce new products and services in a timely manner  our products and services will become obsolete  and our operating results will suffer 

table of contents the customer analytics and business planning software markets are characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
our products could be rendered obsolete if products based on new technologies are introduced or new industry standards emerge 
enterprise computing environments are inherently complex 
as a result  we cannot accurately estimate the life cycles of our products 
new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods  which requires us to hire and retain increasingly scarce  technically competent personnel 
significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in installing or implementing new products could seriously damage our business 
we have  on occasion  experienced delays in the scheduled introduction of new and enhanced products and may experience similar delays in the future 
our future success depends upon our ability to enhance existing products  develop and introduce new products  satisfy customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
we may not successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost effective manner 
future capital needs 
we believe  based upon our current business plan  that our current cash and cash equivalents  funds generated from operations and available credit lines should be sufficient to fund our operations as planned for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may need additional funds sooner than anticipated if our performance deviates significantly from our current business plan or if there are significant changes in competitive or other market factors 
such funds  whether from equity or debt financing or other sources  may not be available  or available on terms acceptable to us 
attempts to expand by means of business combinations and acquisitions may not be successful and may disrupt our operations or harm our revenues 
we have in the past  and may in the future  buy businesses  products or technologies 
in the event of any future purchases  we will face additional financial and operational risks  including difficulty in assimilating the operations  technology and personnel of acquired companies  disruption in our business because of the allocation of resources to consummate these transactions and the diversion of management s attention from our core business  difficulty in retaining key technical and managerial personnel from acquired companies  dilution of our stockholders  if we issue equity to fund these transactions  assumption of increased expenses and liabilities  our relationships with existing employees  customers and business partners may be weakened or terminated as a result of these transactions  and additional ongoing expenses associated with write downs of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 
we rely heavily on key personnel 
we rely heavily on key personnel throughout the organization 
the loss of any of our members of management  or any of our staff of sales and development professionals  could prevent us from successfully executing our business strategies 
any such loss of technical knowledge and industry expertise could negatively impact our success 
moreover  the loss of any critical employees or a group thereof  particularly to a competing organization  could cause us to lose market share  and the applix brand could be diminished 
we may not be able to meet the operational and financial challenges that we encounter in our international operations 
due to the company s significant international operations  we face a number of additional challenges associated with the conduct of business overseas 
for example we may have difficulty managing and administering a globally dispersed business  fluctuations in exchange rates may negatively affect our operating results  
table of contents we may not be able to repatriate the earnings of our foreign operations  we have to comply with a wide variety of foreign laws  we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks overseas due to the uncertainty of laws and enforcement in certain countries relating to the protection of intellectual property rights  reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world could negatively impact the operating results of our foreign operations  export controls could prevent us from shipping our products into and from some markets  multiple and possibly overlapping tax structures could significantly reduce the financial performance of our foreign operations  changes in import export duties and quotas could affect the competitive pricing of our products and services and reduce our market share in some countries  and economic or political instability in some international markets could result in the forfeiture of some foreign assets and the loss of sums spent developing and marketing those assets 
because the customer analytics and business planning markets are highly competitive  we may not be able to succeed 
if we fail to compete successfully in the highly competitive and rapidly changing customer analytics and business planning markets  we may not be able to succeed 
we face competition primarily from customer relationship management software firms  internet customer interaction software vendors and computer telephony software companies 
we also face competition from traditional call center technology providers  large enterprise application software vendors  independent systems integrators  consulting firms and in house it departments 
because barriers to entry into the software market are relatively low  we expect to face additional competition in the future 
many of our competitors can devote significantly more resources to the development  promotion and sale of products than we can  and many of them can respond to new technologies and changes in customer preferences more quickly than we can 
further  other companies with resources greater than ours may attempt to gain market share in the customer analytics and business planning markets by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our competitors 
because we depend on third party systems integrators to sell our products  our operating results will likely suffer if we do not develop and maintain these relationships 
we rely in part on systems integrators to promote  sell and implement our solutions 
if we fail to maintain and develop relationships with systems integrators  our operating results will likely suffer 
in addition  if we are unable to rely on systems integrators to install and implement our products  we will likely have to provide these services ourselves  resulting in increased costs 
as a result  our results of operation may be harmed 
in addition  systems integrators may develop  market or recommend products that compete with our products 
further  if these systems integrators fail to implement our products successfully  our reputation may be harmed 
because the sales cycle for our products can be lengthy  it is difficult for us to predict when or whether a sale will be made 
the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict in large part due to the length and variability of the sales cycle for our products 
companies often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision 
as a result  companies tend to take significant time and effort evaluating our products 
the amount of time and effort depends in part on the size and the complexity of the deployment 
this evaluation process frequently results in a lengthy sales cycle  typically ranging from three to six months 
during this time we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management efforts 
we do not recoup these investments if the prospective customer does not ultimately license our product 

table of contents our business will be harmed if we are unable to protect our trademarks from misuse by third parties 
our collection of trademarks is important to our business 
the protective steps we take or have taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our trademark rights 
we have filed applications for registration of some of our trademarks in the united states 
effective trademark protection may not be available in every country in which we offer or intend to offer our products and services 
failure to protect our trademark rights adequately could damage our brand identity and impair our ability to compete effectively 
furthermore  defending or enforcing our trademark rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
our products may contain defects that may be costly to correct  delay market acceptance of our products and expose us to litigation 
despite testing by applix and our customers  errors may be found in our products after commencement of commercial shipments 
if errors are discovered  we may have to make significant expenditures of capital to eliminate them and yet may not be able to successfully correct them in a timely manner or at all 
errors and failures in our products could result in a loss of  or delay in  market acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation and our ability to convince commercial users of the benefits of our products 
in addition  failures in our products could cause system failures for our customers who may assert warranty and other claims for substantial damages against us 
although our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  it is possible that these provisions may not be effective or enforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions 
our insurance policies may not adequately limit our exposure to this type of claim 
these claims  even if unsuccessful  could be costly and time consuming to defend 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational corporation  the company is exposed to market risk  primarily from changes in foreign exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
the company uses foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
most of the company s international sales through it subsidiaries are denominated in foreign currencies 
relative to foreign currency exposures existing at december   a unfavorable movement in foreign exchange rates would not expose the company to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of the company s foreign currency financial instruments  primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments 
to date  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material effect on the company s operating results 
in all cases  the company uses these derivative instruments to reduce its foreign exchange risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures 
the instruments that the company holds are not leveraged and are not held for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   the company held  in cash equivalents  including  of restricted cash  consisting primarily of money market funds 
cash equivalents are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value  which approximates cost 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of these instruments due to their short maturity  and the company s intention that all the securities will be sold within one year 
there have been no significant changes since december
