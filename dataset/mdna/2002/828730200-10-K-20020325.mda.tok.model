change in control agreements during the second quarter of  the company entered into executive severance agreements with of its key officers 
these agreements are intended to give executives additional assurances concerning their continued employment in the event the company were to engage in discussions concerning or consummate a transaction which involved a change in control of the company 
a change in control transaction includes a merger  share exchange  tender offer or cash purchase of at least of the shares of the company  if within two years after such transaction  there occurs a change in more than a majority of the board of directors 
management believes that it is in the best interests of the stockholders to provide certain assurances regarding continued employment of selected key officers to better assure that the company will be able to properly evaluate any proposed transaction and to continue the company s operations during any transition period 
the agreements  which are only effective for a period of up to two years after a change in control occurs  provide for severance benefits ranging from an amount equal to one year s annual salary to an amount equal to twice the executive s annual salary plus bonus but only if the executive separates from service under certain circumstances within the two year period 
management believes that any potential adverse effect that the existence of these agreements may have on a proposed change in control transaction is outweighed by the benefit to the company of providing additional employment security to the key officers so that the company may retain the services of its experienced officers in evaluating such an offer and continuing its operations either in its present form or following the consummation of such a change in control transaction 
stock repurchase on january   the company announced the expansion of the stock repurchase program 
this expansion authorized the repurchase of an additional  common shares 
the expanded program now has authorized the repurchase of up to  common shares

the company may discontinue purchases at any time that management determines additional purchases are not warranted 
the shares are to be purchased from time to time at prevailing market prices  through open market or unsolicited negotiated transactions  depending upon market conditions 
the company intends to use the repurchased shares to satisfy stock option exercises  payment of future stock dividends and general corporate purposes 
during the twelve month period ended december   the company repurchased  common shares of stock with a weighted average repurchase price of per share 
as of december   the company has repurchased a total of  common shares of stock with a weighted average repurchase price of per share 
the repurchase program had a positive impact on earnings per share of approximately for net interest income net interest income  the company s principal source of earnings  is the difference between the interest income generated by earning assets and the total interest cost of the deposits and borrowings obtained to fund those assets 
factors that determine the level of net interest income include the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  yields earned and rates paid  the level of non performing loans and the amount of non interest bearing liabilities supporting earning assets 
net interest income is analyzed in the discussion and tables below on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
the adjustment to convert certain income to a fully taxable equivalent basis consists of dividing tax exempt income by one minus the combined federal and state income tax rate for  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was million  an increase of approximately  or  from net interest income 
the increase in in net interest income was the result of a  decrease in fully taxable equivalent interest income and a  decrease in interest expense 
interest income decreased from to as a result of a lower yield earned on earning assets  which was offset from the increase in the average balance of earning assets 
the decrease in interest expense from to was the result of a lower cost of funds  which was offset by the increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities 
yield on earning assets and interest bearing liabilities were lower in as the result of lower average interest rates during the net interest margin was in  compared to in the basis point decrease in net interest margin for is the direct result of the interest rate decreases during the year ended december  the federal reserve decreased the discount rate by basis points during in an effort to stimulate a stagnant and declining economy 
the federal reserve s actions to decrease interest rates have negatively affected the net interest margin of the company  as interest rates on earning assets have declined more rapidly than rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
more specifically  the negative impact on net interest margin was due in part to arkansas restrictive usury law 
the usury law limited the interest rate the company could charge on the loan portfolio to a maximum of five percentage points over the federal reserve discount rate 
the most significant impact to net interest margin was in the credit card portfolio  which had to be repriced immediately after each reduction in the discount rate 
on november   the gramm leach bliley act was adopted by congress and signed by the president 
this act included a provision which would set the maximum interest rate on loans made in arkansas  by banks with arkansas as their home state  at the greater of the rate authorized by arkansas law or the highest rate permitted by any of the out of state banks which maintain branches in arkansas 
an action was brought in the western district of arkansas  attacking the validity of the statute in subsequently  the district court issued a decision upholding the statute 
furthermore  during october  the eighth circuit court of appeals upheld that statute 
now that the usury cap issue has been settled  the company anticipates it will be able to manage interest rate risk more effectively going forward 
presently  the company is in the process of implementing new lending guidelines based on the new statute 
while this change did not have a material impact in  the company does expect it to have a positive impact in as a result  if the new statue had been in effect for all of  the company estimates the impact  at a minimum  to net income from the credit card portfolio alone would have been million  or a share 
for the year ended december   net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was million  an increase of approximately million  or  from net interest income 
the increase in in net interest income was the result of a million increase in interest income and a million increase in interest expense 
interest income increased from to as a result of a higher yield earned on earning assets and from growth in the loan portfolio and an improvement in fees on loans 
the increase in interest expense from to was the result of a higher cost of funds and from deposit growth 
yield on earning assets and cost of funds were higher in as the result of higher average interest rates during as a result of the interest rate volatility  the net interest margin was in  compared to in table and reflect an analysis of net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the years ended december   and  respectively  as well as changes in fully taxable equivalent net interest margin for the years versus and versus table analysis of net interest income fte fully taxable equivalent years ended december in thousands interest income    fte adjustment    interest income fte    interest expense    net interest income fte    yield on earning assets fte cost of interest bearing liabilities net interest spread fte net interest margin fte table changes in fully taxable equivalent net interest margin in thousands vs

at december   undivided profits of the company s subsidiaries were approximately million  of which approximately million was available for the payment of dividends to the company without regulatory approval 
in addition to dividends  other sources of liquidity for the company are the sale of equity securities and the borrowing of funds 
banking subsidiaries generally speaking  the company s banking subsidiaries rely upon net inflows of cash from financing activities  supplemented by net inflows of cash from operating activities  to provide cash used in investing activities 
typical of most banking companies  significant financing activities include deposit gathering  use of short term borrowing facilities  such as federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements  and the issuance of long term debt 
the banks primary investing activities include loan originations and purchases of investment securities  offset by loan payoffs and investment maturities 
liquidity represents an institution s ability to provide funds to satisfy demands from depositors and borrowers  by either converting assets into cash or accessing new or existing sources of incremental funds 
a major responsibility of management is to maximize net interest income within prudent liquidity constraints 
internal corporate guidelines have been established to constantly measure liquid assets  as well as relevant ratios concerning earning asset levels and purchased funds 
the management and board of directors of each bank subsidiary monitor these same indicators and makes adjustments as needed 
at year end  each subsidiary bank was within established guidelines and total corporate liquidity remains strong 
at december   cash and cash equivalents  trading and available for sale securities and mortgage loans held for sale were of total assets  as compared to at december  market risk management market risk arises from changes in interest rates 
the company has risk management policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk 
in asset and liability management activities  policies are in place that are designed to minimize structural interest rate risk 
the measurement of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  which reflect changes in market prices and rates  can be found in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate risk represents the potential impact of interest rate changes on net income and capital resulting from mismatches in repricing opportunities of assets and liabilities over a period of time 
a number of tools are used to monitor and manage interest rate risk  including simulation models and interest sensitivity gap analysis 
management uses simulation models to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and various balance sheet strategies on the level of the company s net income and capital 
as a means of limiting interest rate risk to an acceptable level  management may alter the mix of floating and fixed rate assets and liabilities  change pricing schedules and manage investment maturities during future security purchases 
the simulation models incorporate management s assumptions regarding the level of interest rates or balance changes for indeterminate maturity deposits for a given level of market rate changes 
these assumptions have been developed through anticipated pricing behavior 
key assumptions in the simulation models include the relative timing of prepayments  cash flows and maturities 
in addition  the impact of planned growth and anticipated new business is factored into the simulation models 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the models cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of a change in interest rates on net income or capital 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
table presents the company s interest rate sensitivity position at december  this gap analysis is based on a point in time and may not be meaningful because assets and liabilities are categorized according to contractual maturities investment securities are according to call dates and repricing periods rather than estimating more realistic behaviors  as is done in the simulation models 
also  the gap analysis does not consider subsequent changes in interest rate level or spreads between asset and liability categories
