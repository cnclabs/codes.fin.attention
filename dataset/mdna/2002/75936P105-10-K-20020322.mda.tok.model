environmental in december  the company submitted a report to the new hampshire department of environmental services nhdes that summarized the findings of an environmental testing firm engaged by the company with respect to groundwater and surface water monitoring and testing which took place during on one of its owned properties 
the nhdes responded in january with concerns about surface water contamination  volatile organic chemical voc migration off of the property and air quality 
the nhdes mandated further testing before a remediation action plan is considered 
further preliminary testing conducted by the environmental testing firm since the nhdes response suggests that the surface water contamination is caused by the groundwater contamination and that the voc contamination may be migrating off of the property 
once the company s scope of work plans have been approved  the company will conduct further testing to address the nhdes s concerns 
following that testing  the company will present the findings and a recommended plan of remediation to the nhdes 
at this time  it is too early to conclude the form of remediation that will be required  or the cost thereof  but in all likelihood  the remediation required will be a more aggressive one than natural attenuation 
during  the company incurred approximately  of costs principally for its environmental testing firm  with respect to this matter 
terrorism insurance the company is covered under its all risk property insurance policies for acts of terrorism on its consolidated real estate assets through june  terrorism coverage is available for the wellsford whitehall portfolio through june  as well 
the company and wellsford whitehall expect that similar coverage will not be available in connection with an all risk policy and will need to make an assessment of the cost benefit of obtaining terrorism insurance on such assets at that time 
the underwriting procedures utilized by the company and second holding have been modified to evaluate the impact of the lack of  or inability to obtain terrorism insurance by property owners on single assets or small collateral pools for its debt investments 
most real estate collateralizing such investments is currently not insured for acts of terrorism or is expected to lose such coverage as current policies expire and asset owners evaluate the cost of obtaining new policies 
inflation substantially all of wellsford capital s and wellsford whitehall s leases with their tenants provide for separate escalations of real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base amount 
in addition  many of the office leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed escalations based on the cpi or other measures 
the company believes that inflationary increases in expenses will generally be offset by the expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above 
a substantial majority of the leases at the company s multifamily properties are for a term of one year or less which may enable the company to seek increased rents upon renewal or re letting of apartment units 
such short term leases generally minimize the risk to the company of the adverse effects of inflation 
trends the markets in which the company owns and operates its assets or has investments in entities which own and operate assets are subjected to general and local economic business conditions 
based upon the current economic environment  these conditions may negatively impact the occupancy levels and amount of concessions at properties in the wellsford development and wellsford capital sbus or negatively impact property sales in the wellsford capital sbu and the sale of residential units at silver mesa in the wellsford development sbu 
wellsford whitehall would be similarly impacted by such conditions 
net cash flow the company considers net cash flow to be an important measure of its performance  to be considered in addition to net income  predicated on generally accepted accounting principles 
net cash flow  for the company s purposes  represents net income as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles  plus depreciation and amortization on real estate assets  the provision for impairment  share of depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures  offset by accumulated depreciation and recovery of impairment provisions on assets sold 
included in such cash flow is the company s share of undistributed cash retained by the unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures for continuing investment in lieu of future fundings as well as cash obtained from gains on sales of properties 
net cash flow should not be considered a replacement for net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
the following table reconciles net income and net cash flow for the years ended december  net loss income    add deduct depreciation and amortization    provision for impairment a  accumulated depreciation and recovery of impairment provision on assets sold
