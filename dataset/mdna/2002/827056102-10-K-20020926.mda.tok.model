item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction sgi has had declining revenue and has been unprofitable on an operating basis for each of the past five fiscal years as we have felt the impact of the slowdown in the economy  strong competition from much larger companies  technologies and product families in transition and management and employee turnover 
as part of our plan to restore growth and profitability to sgi  we took several major steps in both fiscal and to refocus our operations 
we restructured our overall operations  including closing our manufacturing operations in switzerland and consolidating operations in wisconsin  reorganizing our services business  discontinuing our pentium iii based product line  resulting in noticeable improvements in our gross margins as a percentage of revenues 
we also continued to manage significant reductions in operating expenses over the last two fiscal years compared with fiscal levels 
these changes substantially reduced the scope of our operating losses in fiscal to further improve our financial condition during fiscal  we generated more than million in cash from licensing and sales transactions involving assets including real estate  intellectual property  and a majority equity position in sgi japan 
while substantial progress was made in fiscal  we continue to focus on actions intended to restore long term growth and profitability 
the following tables and discussion present certain financial information on a comparative basis 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively  we sold our cray product line and distributed our remaining interest in mti through a spin off 
we believe it more relevant if certain fiscal year results revenue  gross margin  interest and other  and operating expenses other than restructuring activity are compared with pro forma fiscal results 
the pro forma results for the twelve month period of fiscal used throughout this discussion are adjusted to exclude the results of operations of the cray product line and mti 
results of operations years ended pro forma year ended june  june  june  june  in millions total revenue     cost of revenue    gross profit gross profit margin total operating expenses    operating loss interest and other expense income  net loss before income taxes net loss net loss per share basic and diluted revenue the following discussion of revenue is based on the results of our reportable segments as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
total revenue is principally derived from three reportable segments servers  visual workstations and global services  which were determined based on factors including customer base  homogeneity of products  technology  delivery channels and other factors 
effective for fiscal  we reorganized our global services segment and removed the remanufactured systems sales from this segment 
revenue from remanufactured systems is included in the servers and visual workstations reportable segments 
prior year amounts have been restated to conform to current year presentation 
total revenue in fiscal decreased million or compared with fiscal  and fiscal revenue decreased million or compared with pro forma fiscal revenue for fiscal included a one time receipt of million from microsoft resulting from an agreement involving a patent cross license and the transfer of certain of sgi s intellectual property rights 
the decline in revenue from fiscal to fiscal reflects a general economic slowdown and a significant downturn in it spending  strong competition from much larger companies and products based on processors with higher peak performance benchmarks  the impact of no longer consolidating the revenue of sgi japan  the discontinuance of certain visualization workstations based on pentium iii microprocessors  and other factors discussed below that affected particular product families 
we expect certain of the factors mentioned above to continue to have an adverse impact on our revenue levels going forward 
see risks that affect our business 
the following table presents total revenue by reportable segment with prior year segments restated to reflect current year presentation years ended pro forma year ended june  june  june  june  in millions servers of total revenue visual workstations of total revenue global services of total revenue other of total revenue fiscal server revenue which includes onyx  visual area network and storage products decreased million or compared with fiscal the decrease primarily reflects declines across all product families within this segment  namely visualization systems  high performance servers and integrated storage solutions 
this decline is primarily attributable to concern about the slowdown in the economy that is causing private sector businesses to delay the acquisition of technology wherever possible 
fiscal server revenue decreased million or compared with pro forma fiscal this decline primarily reflects lower revenue levels within our origin brand scalable server business and our onyx graphics system business 
limited availability in the first half of fiscal of the industry standard ceramic packaging used in asics for our origin and onyx systems as well as a slowdown in the economy affected overall shipping patterns within these businesses 
server revenue levels are also affected by competitive factors  including processor speeds  improvements in commodity graphics performance  the suitability of low cost cluster solutions for certain application segments  and the timely release of key software applications on the irix operating system 
see risks that affect our business 
fiscal visual workstation revenue decreased million or compared with fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to the continuing decline in the overall unix workstation market 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced the discontinuance of certain visualization workstations based upon intel bit microprocessors  the impact of which also contributed to the year over year decline in visual workstation revenue 
fiscal visual workstation revenue decreased million or compared with pro forma fiscal the decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to the declining unix workstation market  especially within the o product family 
fiscal results were also adversely impacted by the disappointing sales performance of our visual workstations based on the windows nt operating system 
in light of the disappointing sales performance of our proprietary architecture silicon graphics and silicon graphics visual workstations  we decided to discontinue this product family in favor of products with more industry standard architectures and recorded charges to cost of revenue during fiscal related to this transition 
see gross profit margin and operating expenses 
global services revenue is comprised of hardware and software support and maintenance and professional services 
fiscal global services revenue decreased million or compared with fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to declines in our professional services revenue as a result of the restructuring of our service organization and in our traditional customer support revenue which is being affected by a lower volume of system sales 
fiscal global services revenue decreased million or compared with pro forma fiscal the slight decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to a decline in our traditional customer support revenue  offset in part by the growth of business within our professional services organization 
other revenue is generally comprised of our operating units that are not reportable segments  including the product and service revenue of our application software subsidiary  alias wavefront 
fiscal other revenue includes a one time receipt of million from microsoft resulting from an intellectual property agreement involving a patent cross license and the transfer of certain of sgi s intellectual property rights 
excluding the revenue associated with the one time receipt of million from microsoft  other revenue decreased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal  primarily due to a decline in alias wavefront revenue 
total revenue by geographic area for fiscal  and was as follows in millions years ended pro forma year ended june  june  june  june  area americas    europe rest of world total revenue     geographic revenue as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal  and was as follows years ended pro forma year ended june  june  june  june  area americas europe rest of world the fluctuation in geographic revenue as a percentage of total revenue between the americas and rest of world business in fiscal compared with fiscal is primarily due to the impact of no longer consolidating the revenue of sgi japan 
a decrease in sales in the asia pacific region in fiscal compared with fiscal also contributed to the decline in rest of world revenue as a percentage of total revenue 
the increase in rest of world business in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily reflects increased sales in japan as a percentage of total revenue 
our consolidated backlog at june  was million  down from million at june  backlog declined across all segments of our business and across all regions 
backlog is comprised of committed purchase orders for products and professional services deliverable within six to nine months  depending on the product family 
gross profit margin cost of product and other revenue includes costs related to product shipments  including materials  labor  overhead and other direct or allocated costs involved in their manufacture or delivery 
costs associated with non recurring engineering revenue are included in research and development expense 
cost of service revenue includes all costs incurred in the support and maintenance of our products  as well as costs to deliver professional services 
our overall gross profit margin increased to in fiscal compared with in fiscal excluding the million in revenue recognized from the microsoft intellectual property agreement  gross margin was for fiscal gross margin improvements in fiscal are primarily attributable to decreases in manufacturing overhead expense in the second half of fiscal due to the closure of our manufacturing facility in switzerland  the completion of the restructuring that was announced in the first quarter of fiscal  and a better product mix 
the restructuring included the closure of our manufacturing facility in switzerland and the reorganization of our services business  which has had a significant impact on the increase in our service margins 
gross margin improvements in fiscal were offset slightly due to the change in sgi japan s status during the second quarter of fiscal to a distribution model  which negatively affects gross margin 
see impact of sgi japan transaction 
our overall gross profit margin increased to in fiscal compared with in pro forma fiscal gross profit margin for fiscal includes a million charge for inventory costs related to the discontinuation of the pentium iii processor based product line 
without this charge  gross margin for fiscal would have been 
gross margin for fiscal was affected by the limited availability of certain components in the first and second quarters of fiscal which affected shipping patterns and was a factor in causing a higher percentage of revenue to come from lower margin products 
fiscal gross profit margin includes certain adjustments related to our silicon graphics and visual workstations  including charges of approximately million for third party manufacturing contract cancellations and purchase commitments and for excess product and demonstration inventory 
also  during fiscal  we charged million to cost of service revenue for future unrecoverable visual workstation support costs 
in addition  we recorded a million charge to cost of service revenue for estimated warranty related costs associated with the cray t supercomputer product line and million for the write down of excess spares 
without these adjustments  our gross profit margin for fiscal would have been 
operating expenses years ended pro forma year ended june  june  june  june  in millions research and development of total revenue selling  general and administrative of total revenue other of total revenue our total fiscal operating expenses decreased million or compared with fiscal fiscal operating expenses included million of charges for restructuring and impairment costs 
the significant decline in operating expenses year over year is due to an overall expense reduction program aimed at bringing expenses in line with lower revenue levels 
total fiscal operating expenses decreased million or compared with pro forma fiscal fiscal operating expenses included million of charges for restructuring and impairment and million of charges as a result of the implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system and costs associated with a business reorganization 
pro forma fiscal operating expenses included a net charge of million for estimated restructuring and impairment charges 
research and development fiscal research and development spending decreased million or compared with fiscal the fiscal decrease reflects overall reduction in headcount as a result of the continued restructuring of the company to align expenses with lower revenue levels 
research and development spending decreased million or in fiscal compared with pro forma fiscal the fiscal decrease reflects reductions in headcount as well as more concentrated research and development efforts 
selling  general and administrative fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or compared with fiscal this decrease in operating expenses resulted primarily from lower headcount as a result of restructuring and personnel attrition  and the impact of our overall expense control measures aimed at bringing operating expenses more in line with revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or in fiscal compared with pro forma fiscal the fiscal decrease reflects reduced headcount as a result of restructuring activities and attrition  significantly reduced commission and outside service expenses and the impact of our overall expense control measures aimed at bringing operating expenses more in line with revenues 
the decrease was partially offset by the million of charges as a result of the implementation of an erp system and costs associated with a business reorganization 
other operating expense other operating expense for fiscal represents a charge for estimated restructuring of million and charges of million associated with the impairment of assets  partially offset by adjustments to previously recorded restructuring charges of million 
other operating expense for fiscal represents a charge for estimated restructuring of million and charges of million associated with the impairment of assets  partially offset by adjustments to previously recorded restructuring charges of million 
other operating expense for fiscal represents a net charge for estimated restructuring costs of million 
as a result of these restructuring actions  we anticipate cash outflows of million through fiscal for severance and related charges and canceled contracts and million through fiscal for facilities related expenditures  net of estimated sublease income 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  other operating expense  for further information regarding these activities 
interest and other interest expense interest expense increased in fiscal compared with fiscal and increased in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in interest expense in fiscal is primarily attributable to a full year of interest expense associated with our financing arrangement see note  financing arrangement and higher interest associated with the reset interest rate on the restructured japan debt as compared with fiscal see note  sale of interest in sgi japan 
interest income and other  net interest income and other  net includes interest income on our cash investments  gains and losses on other investments  and other non operating items 
interest income and other  net for fiscal is primarily comprised of a million gain from the sale of of our interest in sgi japan recognized in the second quarter of fiscal  partially offset by a charge of million for the settlement of a securities class action lawsuit involving a payment of million in cash and the issuance of million shares of common stock  and a million loss on the sale of a building recognized in the first quarter of fiscal interest income and other  net for fiscal includes an million write off of a private investment  a million gain on the sale of marketable investments  a million gain related to the sale of the cray product line  and an million gain on the sale of corporate real estate 
significantly lower cash balances in fiscal compared with fiscal also contributed to a decrease in interest income 
provision for income taxes our net benefit for income taxes for fiscal totaled million and arose principally from a change in the us income tax laws that resulted in additional us income tax refunds related to the operating results of fiscal offsetting this federal income tax benefit are various provisions for income taxes payable in state and foreign jurisdictions 
we did not recognize a benefit for our fiscal loss  since the resulting deferred tax asset does not meet the realizability criteria under sfas no 
in fiscal  we made a provision for income taxes totaling million  which was comprised of federal  state  and foreign jurisdictional taxes currently payable 
we did not recognize a benefit for our fiscal loss  since the resulting deferred tax asset does not meet the realizability criteria under sfas no 
at june   we had gross deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences  tax losses  and tax credits of million 
gross deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance of million and deferred tax liabilities of million 
the valuation allowance of million includes million attributable to benefits of stock option deductions  which  if recognized  will be allocated directly to paid in capital 
at june   we had united states federal and foreign jurisdictional net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  million and million  respectively 
the federal losses will begin expiring in fiscal year and the foreign losses will begin expiring in fiscal year at june   we also had general business credit carryovers of approximately million for united states federal tax purposes  which will begin expiring in fiscal year impact of sgi japan transaction during the second quarter of fiscal  we sold a equity interest in sgi japan to nec and nec soft 
this transaction has affected our fiscal results in several ways 
as a minority shareholder  we no longer consolidate the financial results of sgi japan 
we also recognize revenue based on the contractual distribution price of products sold to sgi japan  which for the initial term of our distribution agreement is based on historical pricing 
gross margins are negatively affected by the shift to distributor pricing  which is lower than the price to ultimate customers  offset to some extent by the amortization of the deferred revenue of million which was allocated to the fair value of the exclusive distribution agreement 
this deferred revenue is being recognized as revenue over the three year period beginning in the third quarter of fiscal the fourth quarter results we announced on july  also reflected the elimination of a million restructuring accrual and a million deferred tax valuation allowance  which were no longer required following our sale of the majority interest in sgi japan 
we have determined that these reversals are more appropriately recognized in our second quarter results  and accordingly  have adjusted note to the consolidated financial statements  selected quarterly financial data unaudited 
the second quarter results are adjusted to reflect the following changes to our previously reported second quarter results a million decrease in each of other operating expense and operating loss  a million increase in income before taxes  a million increase in net income  a increase in net income per basic share  and increase in net income per diluted share 
these adjustments have an offsetting impact on the previously announced fourth quarter of fiscal results 
these adjustments did not affect our announced operating results excluding restructuring for any quarter  did not have a cash impact and did not change our full fiscal year results 
financial condition at june   cash and cash equivalents and marketable investments totaled million compared with million at june  also  included in the balance sheet at june  and june  is approximately million and million  respectively  of restricted investments 
restricted investments at june  and june  consist of short and long term investments pledged as collateral against bank credit facilities 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents over prior year is a result of the company s continued focus on cash management  including a focus on account collections and inventory management 
additionally  cash has been supplemented by the sale of assets during the fiscal year  including the sale of a interest in sgi japan 
primarily as a result of net losses  operating activities used million in cash for fiscal  compared with using and million in fiscal and  respectively 
operating cash flows for fiscal benefited from million in one time revenue from the microsoft intellectual property agreement that was received in the first quarter 
to present cash flows from operating activities  net loss for each of the past three years had to be adjusted for certain significant items 
fiscal net loss is adjusted to remove the impact of a gain of million from the sale of the interest in sgi japan that is reflected as a cash flow from investing activities 
fiscal net loss is adjusted to remove the impact of a non cash charge of million for the write off of an investment in a private company and a gain of million on the sale of marketable investments that is reflected as a cash flow from investing activity 
included in fiscal adjustments is an increase of million in our valuation allowance against our remaining deferred tax asset and a tax charge of million related to repatriating accumulated foreign earnings 
partially offsetting these charges is a reduction of million in previously provided income taxes related to certain exposures that were no longer necessary given the increase in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
investing activities  other than changes in our marketable and restricted investments  provided million in cash during fiscal the principal investing activity during fiscal was the sale of a interest in sgi japan for proceeds of million and the sale of corporate real estate and other assets for proceeds of million 
these proceeds were offset in part by capital expenditures totaling million 
investing activities  other than changes in our marketable and restricted investments  provided million in cash during fiscal the principal investing activity during fiscal was the sale of certain corporate real estate for total cash proceeds of million 
these proceeds were partially offset by capital expenditures  including capitalized costs associated with our global erp system 
investing activities  other than changes in our marketable and restricted investments consumed million in cash during fiscal the principal investing activity during fiscal was for the acquisition of capital equipment and our election to exercise an option to purchase five buildings on our mountain view campus for approximately million that had been held under an off balance sheet financing arrangement 
in addition  cash was reduced by million in fiscal as result of the spin off of mti that is no longer included in our consolidated balance sheet 
financing activities over the past three years have included the issuance of common stock under employee stock purchase and option plans  the repurchase of common stock and the repayment of debt 
the principal financing activity during fiscal included the retirement of a million mortgage on our manufacturing facility in switzerland and the non cash restructuring of the yen denominated debt from million to million in the second quarter in conjunction with the sale of a majority equity interest in sgi japan 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we obtained an asset based credit facility 
available credit is determined monthly based on of eligible accounts receivable  up to a maximum of million 
to date  we have used million of this line to secure letters of credit 
the credit facility matures in april  and we currently intend to renew or replace this facility at maturity 
the facility is currently secured by us accounts receivable and inventory  the pledge of certain intellectual property and a million cash deposit 
from time to time  we also deposit additional cash  reflected in our restricted cash balances  to secure certain letters of credit or to address fluctuations within the quarter of eligible accounts receivable 
the credit facility also contains financial and other covenants 
we were not in compliance with the financial covenants in the fourth quarter of fiscal or the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  which were waived by the lenders 
in the event we are not able to comply with the financial and other covenants of this facility in the future  or there is a material adverse change impairing our ability to repay the outstanding balance  the facility may be declared to be in default 
if a default is declared and not waived  or if the facility matures and is not renewed or replaced it could have a significant impact on our working capital 
we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations during each of the past three fiscal years 
primarily as a result of substantial business restructuring and expense reductions  we reduced our net loss and cash consumed from operations significantly from fiscal to fiscal through improved operational execution and the sale of non core assets  we also improved our cash position substantially during fiscal at june   our principal sources of liquidity included unrestricted cash and marketable investments of million  up from million at june  while a forecast of future events is inherently uncertain  we believe that the combination of our current resources and cash expected to be generated from our fiscal operating plan will provide sufficient funding to enable the company to meet its obligations during fiscal we are committed to the successful execution of our operating plan and business turnaround  and will take steps if necessary to further restructure our business operations to reduce expenses and improve working capital 
the failure to achieve our objectives for fiscal revenue and operating results or significant changes in the terms of our relationships with key suppliers  could result in our not having adequate liquidity to manage our business 
future payments due under debt and lease obligations as of june  are as follows in thousands fiscal year ended thereafter total loan payable to sgi japan due dec payable in quarterly installments     senior convertible notes due sep  convertible subordinated debentures due feb non cancelable operating leases     total       critical accounting policies and estimates sgi s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  warranty obligations  impairment of long lived assets and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for all these policies  we caution that future events often do not develop exactly as forecast  and that even the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition a majority of our revenue is derived from product sales which is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain of our revenue is generated from high performance systems that may include customer acceptance criteria and for which revenue is deferred until such acceptance is obtained 
our product revenue is derived from product sales that require estimates for sales returns and other allowances at the time of revenue recognition 
these estimates are based on historical information  current economic trends and other factors 
if the data used to calculate these estimates does not properly anticipate future returns and allowances  revenue could be misstated 
to date  actual experience has been consistent with our estimates 
product warranties we provide for the estimated cost to warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship at the time revenue is recognized 
we estimate our warranty obligation based on factors such as product lifecycle analysis and historical experience  and our estimate is affected by data such as product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
on a quarterly basis  these estimates are reviewed and adjusted as considered necessary based on the factors noted above 
bad debt we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to pay their outstanding obligation for reasons such as a deterioration in their operating results or financial position or bankruptcy proceedings  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce their receivable to an amount we reasonably believe is collectible 
if the financial condition of specific customers were to change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
we also record allowances for doubtful accounts for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical experience 
on a quarterly basis  these estimates are reviewed and adjusted as considered necessary based on the criteria noted above 
manufacturing and spares inventory we write down our inventory for estimated excess  obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
at every balance sheet date  we perform an in depth excess and obsolete analysis of all manufacturing inventory parts on order and on hand based upon assumptions about future demand and current market conditions 
for all spares inventory on hand  our analysis is based on assumptions about product life cycles  historical usage  current production status and installed base 
additional adjustments to inventory may be required if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us during the analysis 
deferred taxes we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income over the next three years  and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe to be more likely than not realizable 
restructuring in recent fiscal years  we have recorded significant accruals in connection with our restructuring programs 
these accruals include estimates of employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations including lease terminations resulting from our actions 
accruals associated with vacated facilities and related asset impairments are estimated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas 
estimates may be adjusted upward or downward upon occurrence of a future triggering event 
triggering events may include  but are not limited to  changes in estimated time to sublease  sublease terms and sublease rates 
due to the extended contractual obligations of certain of these leases and the inherent volatility of commercial real estate markets  we expect to make future adjustments to these vacated facilities accruals 
loss contingencies we record an obligation for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods and there is a reasonable probability that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors that often depend on judgements about the outcome of pending lawsuits and potential actions by third parties including government agencies 
long term investments we hold or have held investments in other companies which are accounted for under either the cost method or equity method of accounting and we monitor these investments for impairment on a periodic basis 
some of these companies are publicly traded and have volatile share prices  while many of these companies are not publicly traded and therefore the fair value may be difficult to determine 
many of our investments in non publicly traded companies represent emerging technology companies which are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never develop 
in the event that the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis for the investment is established 
fair values for investments in public companies are determined using quoted market prices 
fair values for investments in privately held companies are estimated based upon factors such as liquidation values  the values of recent rounds of financing  or quoted market prices of comparable public companies 
to determine whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we evaluate  among other factors the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than the carrying value  the financial health of and specific prospects for the company  and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
other significant accounting policies other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
policies regarding financial instruments  stock based compensation and consolidation require difficult judgements on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
certain of these matters are among topics currently under reexamination by accounting standards setters and regulators 
although no specific conclusions reached by these standards setters appear likely to cause a material change in our accounting policies  outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence 
also see note summary of significant accounting policies which discusses accounting policies that must be selected when there are acceptable alternatives 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  which eliminates the pooling of interest method and provides a single method approach  the purchase method  for the accounting for all business combinations  as well as new criteria for recognition of intangible assets 
sfas is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  the company adopted sfas which had no impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which establishes new standards for goodwill and other intangible assets  including the elimination of goodwill amortization  to be replaced with periodic evaluation of goodwill for impairment 
we will adopt sfas on june  at which time  we are required to evaluate our existing goodwill and intangible assets and make any necessary reclassifications in order to comply with the new criteria in sfas we will then be required to reassess the useful lives of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations  including those reclassified from goodwill  and make any necessary amortization adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
to the extent that any intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  sfas requires us to test the intangible asset for impairment and recognize any impairment losses as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
after the identification and assessment of intangible assets discussed above  we are required  under sfas  to identify reporting units and assign all related assets and liabilities and goodwill to the reporting units 
we must then complete the two step transitional goodwill impairment test 
the first step  which must be completed within six months of adoption of sfas  requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent that a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and we are required to complete step two of the transitional goodwill impairment test as soon as possible  but no later than june  step two requires us to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount as of june  any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as a cumulative change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
we have not yet completed our analysis to determine the impact  if any  on our financial results 
at june   we had goodwill and intangible assets of million subject to sfas amortization expense for goodwill amounted to million for the year ended june  the net impact on the statement of operations from the adoption of sfas is expected to be a reduction in amortization of approximately million 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets or sfas that is applicable to financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   with transition provisions for certain matters 
the fasb s new rules on asset impairment supersede fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
although retaining many of the fundamental recognition and measurement provisions of statement  the new rules significantly change the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
the new rules also will supersede the provisions of apb opinion with regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business and will require expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in discontinued operations in the period s in which the losses are incurred rather than as of the measurement date as presently required 
we adopted sfas in the second quarter of fiscal in june the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between statement and issue relates to statement s requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost as generally defined in issue was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
a fundamental conclusion reached by the fasb in this statement is that an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create an obligation that meets the definition of a liability 
therefore  this statement eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in issue this statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
severance pay under statement  in many cases  would be recognized over time rather than up front 
the fasb decided that if the benefit arrangement requires employees to render future service beyond a minimum retention period a liability should be recognized as employees render service over the future service period even if the benefit formula used to calculate an employee s termination benefit is based on length of service 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
risks that affect our business sgi operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
this discussion highlights some of these risks 
continuing losses and impact on working capital 
in recent years our continuing net losses  resulting mainly from declining revenues  have consumed cash resources  which we have offset to some extent through improved working capital management and the disposition of non core assets 
operating activities consumed million in cash during fiscal  and at june  we had unrestricted cash and marketable investments of million 
we believe that the combination of our current resources and our planned results for fiscal will provide sufficient funding to allow us to meet our obligations during fiscal however  because our cash levels fluctuate significantly during quarters  and especially given the uncertainties of the present business climate  we will continue to focus on expense controls and working capital efficiencies to improve our liquidity 
because we have fewer opportunities than in the past to generate cash through the sales of non core assets or other nonrecurring transactions  it will be especially important that we achieve our planned for operating results  which will require that we reverse or at least reduce the rate of the revenue declines experienced in recent years 
failure to achieve our targets could cause significant changes in the terms on which we deal with our suppliers or could otherwise result in our having insufficient liquidity to manage our business 
given our credit rating  if we should need to obtain short term borrowings  there can be no assurance that such borrowings would be available or could be obtained at reasonable rates 
the inability to obtain such borrowings could have a material adverse impact on our operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we have an asset based credit facility that may be declared to be in default if we fail to meet certain financial and other covenants 
the credit facility matures in april and we currently intend to renew or replace this facility at maturity 
the facility is currently secured by us accounts receivable and inventory  the pledge of certain intellectual property and a million cash deposit 
from time to time  we also deposit additional cash  reflected in our restricted cash balances  to secure certain letters of credit or to address fluctuations within the quarter of eligible accounts receivable 
the credit facility also contains financial and other covenants 
we were not in compliance with the financial covenants in the fourth quarter of fiscal or the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  which were waived by the lenders 
in the event we are not able to comply with the financial and other covenants of this facility in the future  or there is a material adverse change impairing our ability to repay the outstanding balance  the facility may be declared to be in default 
if a default is declared and not waived  or if the facility matures and is not renewed or replaced it could have a significant impact on our working capital 
period to period fluctuations 
our operating results may fluctuate for a number of reasons 
delivery cycles are typically short  other than for large scale server products 
over half of each quarter s product revenue results from orders booked and shipped during the third month  and disproportionately in the latter half of that month 
these factors make the forecasting of revenue inherently uncertain 
because we plan our operating expenses  many of which are relatively fixed in the short term  on expected revenue  even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause a period s results to be substantially below expectations 
such a revenue shortfall could arise from any number of factors  including lower than expected demand  supply constraints  delays in the availability of new products  transit interruptions  overall economic conditions  military or terrorist actions  or natural disasters 
demand can also be adversely affected by product and technology transition announcements by sgi or our competitors 
the timing of customer acceptance of certain large scale server products may also have a significant effect on periodic operating results 
margins are heavily influenced by mix considerations  including geographic concentrations  the mix of product and service revenue  and the mix of server and desktop product revenue including the mix of configurations within these product categories 
the present uncertainty in the economy has impacted the timing of buying decisions of our customers 
unless and until the economic environment becomes more positive it will be difficult for us to experience growth in revenue 
our stock price  like that of other technology companies  is subject to significant volatility 
if revenue or earnings in any quarter fail to meet the investment community s expectations  there could be an immediate adverse impact on our stock price 
the stock price may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to our performance 
the listing rules of the nyse generally require that listed securities trade at a minimum per share price of when averaged over a day trading period 
if the common stock price fails to rise above this minimum threshold and if sgi fails to take action  such as a reverse stock split  to address this issue  the common stock could be delisted from the exchange  which would impair the liquidity available to holders of the common stock 
product development and introduction 
meeting our objectives for fiscal and beyond will require the timely development and introduction of successful new products 
product transitions are a recurring part of our business 
a number of risks are inherent in this process 
the development of new technology and products is increasingly complex and uncertain  which increases the risk of delays 
the introduction of new computer systems requires close collaboration and continued technological advancement involving multiple hardware and software design teams  internal and external manufacturing teams  outside suppliers of key components such as semiconductor and storage products and outsourced manufacturing partners 
the failure of any one of these elements could cause our new products to fail to meet specifications or to miss the aggressive timetables that we establish 
there is no assurance that acceptance of our new systems will not be affected by delays in this process 
as noted above  our ability to successfully attract and retain key technical  marketing and management personnel has a direct impact on our ability to maintain our product development timetables 
short product life cycles place a premium on our ability to manage the transition to new products 
we often announce new products in the early part of a quarter while the product is in the final stages of development and testing  and seek to manufacture and ship the product in volume during the same quarter 
our results could be adversely affected by such factors as development delays  the release of products to manufacturing late in any quarter  quality or yield problems experienced by suppliers  variations in product costs and excess inventories of older products and components 
in addition  some customers may delay purchasing existing products in anticipation of new product introductions 
most products are upgraded during their product life cycle 
the ability to upgrade products in a timely fashion is necessary to compete in the computer industry 
delays in introducing updates and upgrades can adversely affect acceptance and demand for our products 
dependence on partners and suppliers 
our business has always involved close collaboration with partners and suppliers 
however  many elements of our current business strategy  including the addition of scalable servers based on itanium processors and the linux operating system in the second half of this fiscal year  will increase our dependence on intel and other partners  and on our manufacturing partners and other component suppliers 
our business could be adversely affected  for example  if intel fails to meet product release schedules  if we experience supply constraints  or if we experience any other interruption or delay in the supply chain 
the competitiveness of our system products  particularly our servers  is significantly affected by the availability on our platform of third party software applications that are important to customers in our target markets 
our ability to work with our software partners to ensure porting of these applications to our irix operating system and  in the future  to linux  is a key factor to our business success 
impact of government customers 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from sales to the united states government  either directly by us or through system integrators and other resellers 
sales to the government present risks in addition to those involved in sales to commercial customers  including potential disruptions due to appropriation and spending patterns and the government s reservation of the right to cancel contracts for its convenience 
a portion of our business requires security clearances from the united states government 
we have implemented measures to maintain our clearances in light of the fact that our ceo  robert bishop  is not a us citizen 
however  these arrangements are subject to customer review and approval and periodic review by the defense security service of the department of defense 
any disruption or limitation in our ability to do business with the united states government could have an adverse impact on sgi 
export regulation 
our sales to foreign customers are subject to export regulations 
sales of many of our high end products require clearance and export licenses from the us department of commerce under these regulations 
the us departments of commerce and justice are currently conducting civil and criminal investigations into sgi s compliance with the export regulations in connection with several export sales to tier countries 
we have agreed to waivers of the statutes of limitations for these matters and are currently in discussion with the authorities concerning a potential resolution 
we believe that these matters will be resolved without a significant adverse effect on our business 
there is no assurance  however  that we will reach an acceptable resolution or that the ultimate result would not impair the conduct of our business with the us government or our sales outside the united states 
our international sales would also be adversely affected if such regulations were tightened  or if they are not modified over time to reflect the increasing performance of our products 
the swiss authorities are also investigating compliance with their export regulations in connection with exports from the swiss manufacturing facility we closed during the second quarter of fiscal we believe that these matters will be resolved without a significant adverse effect on our business 
employees 
our success depends on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified technical  sales  marketing and management personnel 
the uncertainties surrounding sgi s business prospects have increased the challenges of retaining world class talent 
we implemented further restructuring actions during fiscal as we continue to work through the turnaround process  there is no guarantee that we will not lose highly qualified employees or that we will be able to hire highly qualified candidates as new skills are needed 
competition 
the computer industry is highly competitive  with rapid technological advances and constantly improving price performance 
most of our competitors have substantially greater technical  marketing and financial resources 
they also generally have a larger installed base of customers  processors that benchmark at higher peak performance and a wider range of available applications software 
competition may result in significant discounting and lower gross margins 
intellectual property 
we routinely receive communications from third parties asserting patent or other rights covering our products and technologies 
based upon our evaluation  we may take no action or may seek to obtain a license 
in any given case there is a risk that a license will not be available on terms that we consider reasonable  or that litigation will ensue 
we expect that  as the number of hardware and software patents issued continues to increase  and as competition in the markets we address intensifies  the volume of these intellectual property claims will also increase 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is routinely subjected to a variety of risks  including market risk associated with interest rate movements and currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities  as well as collectibility of accounts receivable 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
as a result  we do not anticipate material losses in these areas 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our convertible subordinated notes 
fixed rate securities and borrowings may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in high quality money market instruments and debt instruments  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of generally less than three years 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  we use sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our debt and financial instruments 
the financial instruments included in the sensitivity analysis consist of all of our cash and cash equivalents  marketable investments  short term and long term debt and all derivative financial instruments 
currency forward contracts and currency options constitute our portfolio of derivative financial instruments 
to perform sensitivity analysis  we assess the risk of loss in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on market sensitive instruments 
we compute the market values for interest risk based on the present value of future cash flows as impacted by the changes in rates attributable to the market risk being measured 
we selected the discount rates used for the present value computations based on market interest rates in effect at june  and june  we computed the market values for foreign exchange risk based on spot rates in effect at june  and june  the market values that result from these computations are compared to the market values of these financial instruments at june  and june  the differences in this comparison are the hypothetical gains or losses associated with each type of risk 
the results of the sensitivity analysis at june  and june  are as follows interest rate risk a percentage point decrease in the levels of interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in a decrease in the aggregate fair values of our financial instruments by million and million at june  and june   respectively 
a percentage point increase in the levels of interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in an increase in the aggregate fair values of our financial instruments by million and million  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a strengthening of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would result in a decrease in the fair values of our financial instruments by million and million at june  and june   respectively 
a weakening of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would result in an increase in the fair values of our financial instruments by million at june  and million at june  the financial instruments measured in the foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity analysis are used in our hedging program to reduce our overall corporate exposure to changes in exchange rates
