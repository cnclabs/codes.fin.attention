the number of shares crossed on the us posit system increased billion  or  from billion in to billion in the number of shares crossed on the us posit system per trading day increased million  or  from million in to million in electronic trading desk revenues increased due to both an increase in us share volume in and the inclusion of million of revenues from itg australia  itg canada and itg europe for which only  of revenues were reported in client site revenues increased resulting from a increase in share volume in  partially offset by a decrease in average client site revenue per share 
the decrease in average client site revenue per share reflects  in part  growth in our lower priced routing only services  where we do not incur transaction processing costs 
other revenues decreased primarily as a result of the gain of million  or of the decrease  recognized in  from the sale of our investment in versus technologies  inc also contributing to the decrease was a reduction of million  from million in to million in  in connection with fees for development and other services provided to our unconsolidated international affiliates  prior to our acquisition of the remaining interests in itg australia and itg europe  and a million writedown on our venture capital investment in the angel investors ii  lp fund as a result of a decrease in fair value

additionally  percent of the increase related to new staff in technology  product development  sales and trading and production infrastructure 
total compensation and employee benefits as a percentage of revenues increased from in to in this increase is mainly attributable to the consolidation of the international operations  primarily the operations of itg europe and itg canada which are still at an early stage of their lifecycle  while the us percentage increased primarily due to four fewer trading days during average compensation and employee benefits expenses per average headcount decreased  or  from  to  transaction processing transaction processing as a percentage of revenues decreased from to 
this includes transaction costs incurred by itg australia  itg canada and itg europe that were not included in us transaction costs as a percentage of revenues decreased from in to in despite our share volume growth  us clearing and execution costs as a percentage of revenues declined primarily from rate reductions negotiated with our clearing vendor 
this was partially offset by ecn execution costs which  in the us  increased million or from million in to million in reflecting higher ecn volume  which more than doubled from the impact of higher ecn execution volume was partially offset by significant cost savings achieved through rate reductions and from a higher share of executions being made through lower unit cost ecn providers 
software royalties because software royalties are contractually fixed as a percentage of posit revenues  the increase is entirely attributable to an increase in posit revenues 
occupancy and equipment depreciation and amortization on furniture  fixtures and equipment  and office rent were the main contributors to the million increase in compared to the international operations accounted for million  or of the increase  following the opening of additional offices in june in toronto  canada and the inclusion of space utilized by itg australia and itg europe subsequent to consolidation of these entities in november and may  respectively

net gain loss on long term investments in  we recognized a gain of million through our itg europe joint venture relating to the sale of  shares of stock that itg europe held in the lse which were received at the time of the lse demutualization in the year the reported gain on long term investments of million was net of our million share of itg europe s operating loss prior to consolidation in may in  we recognized a loss on long term investments primarily resulting from the start up costs of our vostock joint venture with soundview technology group  inc combined with losses on our itg europe joint venture relating to the development and marketing costs of our european expansion 
vostock was developed to provide an on line auction market for secondary share offerings to supplement the traditional distribution methods for secondary offerings 
the vostock product was never launched and we and soundview have ceased our expenditures on vostock 
other general and administrative the increase in other general and administrative expenses reflects a million increase in consulting fees for software development initiatives  the addition of million of costs incurred by itg australia  itg canada  itg europe and itg hong kong  as well as a million increase in software amortization for certain products that were released in the fourth quarter of in  we made a charitable contribution to the new york times neediest fund in the amount of million following the tragic events of september  income tax expense the decrease in the effective tax rate from in to in was primarily due to decreases in state and local income taxes

electronic trading desk revenues increased primarily from an increase in share volume of billion or from billion in to billion in  partially offset by an decrease in the average revenue per share in attributable  in part  to growth in executions by our clients through ecns 
other revenues increased primarily due to a a gain recorded on the sale of our remaining investment in versus technologies  inc  b increases in investment income arising from larger average interest earning balances and improved rates of return and c international development fee income  which were partially offset by interest costs incurred on accelerated settlement of transactions in the normal course of business

approximately of the increase in employees were staffed in technology  product development and production infrastructure and of the increase in employees related to the addition of canada and australia 
average compensation and employee benefits expenses per average headcount increased  or  from  to  transaction processing transaction processing as a percentage of revenues increased from to of revenues 
ecn costs increased million from million in to million in additionally  clearing costs increased by million in from million in to million in as a result of share volume increases and a decrease in the average ticket size 
partially offsetting the increases were decreases in super dot costs  primarily specialist charges  due to a pricing change which eliminated nyse specialist charges for trades executed within minutes as compared to minutes in software royalties because software royalties are contractually fixed as a percentage of posit revenues  the increase is wholly attributable to an increase in posit revenues 
occupancy and equipment the increase in headcount and infrastructure enhancements resulted in increased equipment purchases and the associated depreciation and maintenance expenses 
in addition  rent expense increased due to the expansion of our research and development facility in culver city  california  and our new york headquarters  as well as the opening of additional offices during in toronto  canada and waltham  massachusetts 
telecommunications and data processing services increases in our client base and employee base resulted in additional client data services  including market data line connections  increased communication charges to link clients to itg in new york and boston  and for infrastructure improvements to accommodate volume growth and the move to decimalization 
telecommunications and data processing services as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly to in from in net loss on long term investments the increase in loss on long term investments in over primarily resulted from the recorded losses incurred by our european joint venture  a  loss from our vostock joint venture with wit soundview and the effect of the deferred gain on the sale of the longview group  realized in  after having been held in escrow for one year 
other general and administrative the increase in other general and administrative expenses reflects an increase in legal  accounting and consulting professional fees along with increased spending on business development 
these expenses were partially offset by lower software amortization for certain products that were released in late  which had increased the related expense in income tax expense the decrease in the effective tax rate from in to in was due to decreases in state and local income taxes partially offset by higher nondeductible foreign losses in dependence on major customers during  revenue from our largest customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue while revenue from each of our three largest customers accounted for   and  respectively  of consolidated revenue 
during  revenue from our largest customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue while revenue from each of our three largest customers accounted for   and  respectively  of consolidated revenue 
during  revenue from our largest customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue while revenue from each of our three largest customers accounted for  and  respectively  of consolidated revenue 
customers may discontinue use of our services at any time 
the loss of any significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  the loss of significant posit customers could result in lower share volumes of securities submitted to posit systems around the world  which may adversely affect the liquidity of systems 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity and capital resource requirements result from our working capital needs  primarily consisting of compensation and benefits  transaction processing fees and software royalty fees 
historically  cash from operations has met all working capital requirements 
a substantial portion of our assets are liquid  consisting of cash and cash equivalents or assets readily convertible into cash 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements 
we generally invest our excess cash in money market funds and other short term investments that generally mature within days or less 
additionally  securities owned at fair value include highly liquid  state and municipal obligations  auction rate preferred stock and common stock 
at december   cash equivalents and securities owned at fair value amounted to million and net receivables from brokers  dealers and other  of million were due within days 
at december   cash and cash equivalents included deposits at clearing firms totaling million 
we also invest a portion of our excess cash balances in cash enhanced strategies  which we believe should yield higher returns without any significant effect on risk 
as of december   we had investments in limited partnerships investing in marketable securities and a venture capital fund amounting to million in the aggregate 
the limited partnerships employ either a hedged convertible strategy or a long short strategy to capitalize on short term price movements 
cash flows from operating activities reached million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to the growth in net income and other changes in working capital  partially offset by the decrease in the tax benefit from employee stock options  reflecting the exercise by employees of stock options with higher strike prices 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the prior year 
this increase is primarily related to the million purchases of i the remaining stake in the itg europe joint venture and ii the assets of kastennet via ktg technologies corporation in canada  net of cash acquired 
in  the company also invested million in limited partnerships 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the prior year when the company purchased million worth of its common stock as part of the company s share buy back program 
for the year ended december   cash flows from operating activities were million  a decrease of million from the prior year  reflecting working capital changes 
net cash used in investing activities was million  an improvement of million from the prior year  reflecting lower investments in limited partnerships  partially offset by higher capital expenditures 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   an improvement of million from the prior year when the company i paid a million special cash dividend in connection with the spin off from jefferies group and ii purchased million worth of its common stock 
as of december   the company s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments consisted principally of minimum future rentals under non cancelable operating leases as follows dollars in thousands year ending december  and thereafter  total  on february   we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of hoenig for cash consideration of approximately million 
hoenig is expected to have approximately million of cash and cash equivalents at the closing date 
the acquisition is expected to close by june  we anticipate funding the purchase price from our existing cash balances 
historically  all regulatory capital needs of itg inc and alternet have been provided by cash from operations 
we believe that cash flows from operations will provide itg inc and alternet with sufficient regulatory capital 
as of december   itg inc and alternet had net excess regulatory capital of million and million  respectively 
in addition  itg canada  itg australia and itg europe had regulatory capital in excess of the minimum requirements applicable to each company as of december  of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
although we believe that the combination of our existing net regulatory capital and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet regulatory capital requirements  a shortfall in net regulatory capital would have a material adverse effect on us 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 
and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and immediately applicable to business combinations occurring after june  under the new rules  all business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method 
in addition  goodwill and some intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the new standards 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the adoption of sfas no 
in the first quarter of will impact the goodwill associated with our completed acquisitions of itg australia and itg europe 
the new rules were applied on our september  acquisition of the assets of kastennet via ktg 
discontinuance of goodwill amortization is not expected to materially impact future earnings 
we expect to perform the required impairment test of our goodwill in the second quarter of  as of january  we do not anticipate that these tests will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
in the first quarter of is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
issues and uncertainties while our management s expectations for the future are optimistic  the following issues and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating our growth outlook 
financial market conditions and economic conditions our business is materially affected by conditions in both domestic and foreign financial markets 
the demand for our securities brokerage and related services are also directly affected by factors such as economic and political conditions that may lead to decreased trading activity and prices in the securities markets generally 
the future economic environment will be subject to periodic economic downturns  such as recessions  which could also result in reduced trading volumes and prices  which could materially harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
decreases in trading volumes or market prices declines in the volume of securities trading and in market liquidity generally result in lower revenues from our posit  client site and electronic trading desk products 
in addition  our trading commissions outside the us and canada are based on the value of transactions rather than volume based  which would be adversely affected by price declines 
our profitability would be adversely affected by a decline in trading revenues because a significant portion of our costs is fixed 
for these reasons  decreases in trading volume or securities prices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
regulation general the securities markets and the brokerage industry in which we operate are subject to extensive regulation in the united states and other jurisdictions around the world 
we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
in our case  the impact of regulation extends beyond traditional areas of securities regulation  such as disclosure and prohibitions on fraud and manipulation by market participants  to the regulation of the structure of markets 
the securities industry has been subject to several fundamental regulatory changes 
in the future  the industry may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations  which may adversely affect our business 
the markets for equity securities have been subject to the most significant regulatory changes 
we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes can affect our business 
regulation ats before regulation ats went into effect on april   we operated posit pursuant to a no action letter from the sec staff which stated that it would not commence an enforcement action if posit were operated without registering as an exchange 
we are currently operating posit and smartservers as part of our broker dealer operations in accordance with regulation ats 
accordingly  neither posit nor our smartservers are registered with the sec as an exchange 
there can be no assurance that the sec will not in the future seek to impose more stringent regulatory requirements on the operation of alternative trading systems such as posit and smartservers 
there can be no assurance that congress will not enact additional legislation applicable to alternative trading systems 
net capital requirement each of our broker dealer subsidiaries is subject to regulatory capital requirements promulgated by the regulatory and exchange authorities of the countries in which they operate 
the failure by any of these subsidiaries to maintain its required regulatory capital may lead to suspension or revocation of its broker dealer registration and its suspension or expulsion by us or international regulatory bodies  and ultimately could require its liquidation 
competition the financial services industry generally  and the securities brokerage business in which we engage in particular  is extremely competitive  and we expect it to remain so 
the brokerage and related services offered by us compete with services provided by leading brokerage firms and transaction processing firms and with providers of electronic trading and trade order management systems and financial information services 
posit also competes with various national and regional securities exchanges and execution facilities  the nasdaq national market  atss and ecns for trade execution services 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources 
many of them offer a wider range of services  have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do 
outside the united states  in addition to our us competitors with international capabilities  we compete with non us financial service companies that may also have long standing  well established relations with their clients  some of which also hold dominant positions in their trading markets 
we compete on the basis of a number of factors  including access to liquidity  transaction execution  our products and services  innovation  reputation and price 
insufficient system capacity or system failures our business relies heavily on the computer and communications systems supporting our operations 
peak trading times and times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even fail for periods of time 
general power or telecommunications failures or natural disasters could cause blackouts in our systems 
the presence of computer viruses can also cause failure of our systems 
as our business expands  we will need to expand our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions 
if any of our systems do not operate properly or are disabled  we could incur financial loss  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage 
system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations  initiate regulatory inquiries or proceedings  file lawsuits against us  trade less frequently through us or cease doing business with us 
rapid changes in technology due to the high demand for technology based services in the securities industry  we are subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry standards 
also  customer demands become greater and more sophisticated as the dissemination of information to customers increases 
if we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demand for new services  products and technologies in a timely and cost effective manner and to adapt to the technological advancements and changing standards  we will be less able to compete effectively  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk from third parties that owe us money  securities  or other obligations  including our customers and trading counterparties 
these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  operational failure or other reasons 
substantially all of the clearing and depository operations for our broker dealer subsidiaries are performed pursuant to clearing agreements with their clearing brokers  who review the credit risk of trading counterparties  as deemed necessary 
volatile securities markets  credit markets and regulatory changes increase our exposure to credit risk  which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
license and relationship with barra we have a perpetual license with the posit joint venture  which is a joint venture we have with barra 
the license grants itg inc the exclusive right to use certain proprietary software necessary to the continued operation of posit and a non exclusive license to use proprietary software that operates in conjunction with posit 
the license agreement permits barra on behalf of the joint venture to terminate the agreement upon certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency or upon an uncured breach by itg inc  of certain covenants  the performance of which are all within our control 
although we do not believe that we will experience difficulty in complying with our obligations under the license agreement  any termination of the license agreement resulting from an uncured default would have a material adverse effect on us 
the posit joint venture also licensed to itg australia limited and itg europe the right to use the posit technology for crossing australian and european equity securities 
these licenses contain substantially the same default and termination provisions as the us license 
research and product development in connection with our research and product development activities  as well as capital expenditures to improve other aspects of our business  we incur substantial expenses that do not vary directly  at least in the short term  with fluctuations in securities transaction volumes and revenues 
in the event of a material reduction in revenues  we may not be able to reduce such expenses quickly and  as a result  we could experience reduced profitability or losses 
conversely  sudden surges in transaction volumes can result in increased profit and profit margin 
to ensure that we have the capacity to process projected increases in transaction volumes  we have historically made substantial capital and operating expenditures in advance of such projected increases  including during periods of low transaction volumes 
in the event that such growth in transaction volumes does not occur  the expenses related to such investments could cause reduced profitability or losses 
changes in our customer base changes in our customer base which includes institutional investors  portfolio managers  hedge funds and broker dealers can materially affect our profitability and net income 
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from our largest customers 
the loss of any significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  the loss of significant posit customers could result in lower share volumes of securities submitted to posit  which may adversely affect the liquidity of the system  which could reduce its attractiveness to our customers and adversely affect our trading volumes  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on third party suppliers for key services we depend on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading systems  computers and other equipment  and related support and maintenance 
we cannot be certain that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient and cost effective manner or that they will be able to meet our expanding needs 
if we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of these services in the event of a disruption in the services  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed 
risks of infringement of our intellectual property rights we rely upon patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secrets to establish and protect our rights in our proprietary technology  methods and products 
however  a third party may still try to challenge  invalidate or circumvent the mechanisms we select to protect our rights 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us in the past several years  there has been a proliferation of so called business method patents applicable to the computer and financial services industries 
under current law  us patent applications remain secret for months and may  depending upon where else such applications are filed  remain secret until issuance of a patent 
thus it is not economically practicable to determine in advance whether our products or services may infringe the present or future patent rights of others 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology from disclosure or that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 
it is likely that from time to time we may also face claims that use of technology material to our business operations infringes on rights of third parties or we may be called upon to defend a joint venture partner  customer or licensee against such third party claims  which could consume valuable time  result in costly litigation or cause delays  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market price risk as part of our company s full service equity trade execution business we do not engage in proprietary trading  however  at times we do hold positions overnight due to client or company errors 
accordingly  we maintain policies and procedures regarding the management of our errors and accommodations proprietary trading accounts 
it is our policy to attempt to trade out of all positions arising from errors and accommodations immediately while balancing our exposure to market risk  which can arise from liquidating such positions 
accordingly  certain positions may be liquidated over a period of time in an effort to minimize market impact 
we have established approval policies that include review by a supervisory principal of any proprietary trading activity 
our operations department reviews all open trades intraday in an effort to ensure that any open issues are addressed and resolved by the close of the trading day 
additionally  our clearing broker notifies us of all known trade discrepancies on the day following the trade date 
we employ a cash management strategy which seeks to optimize excess liquid assets by preserving principal  maintaining liquidity to satisfy capital requirements  minimizing risk and maximizing our after tax rate of return 
for working capital purposes  we invest only in money market instruments 
cash balances that are not needed for normal operations are invested in a tax efficient manner in instruments with appropriate maturities and levels of risk to correspond to expected liquidity needs 
we currently have investments in municipal bonds  auction rate preferred bonds and common stock 
to the extent that we invest in marketable equity securities  we ensure portfolio liquidity by investing in marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
a portion of the investments under our cash management strategy are managed by inference  our asset management subsidiary  which conducts its trading activities on our behalf in accordance with investment strategies reviewed with senior management and is subject to oversight by our chief financial officer 
at december  and  our cash and cash equivalents and securities owned were approximately million and million  respectively 
we will from time to time  make investments that are considered strategic 
these investments require approval of executive management and or the board of directors 
this component of our cash management strategy is reevaluated periodically 
at december  and  investments in limited partnerships investing in marketable securities and a venture capital fund were approximately million and million  respectively 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the interest bearing portions of our investment portfolio 
our policy is to invest in high quality credit issuers  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and invest in tax efficient strategies 
our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss 
we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and re investment risk 
we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in high quality credit securities that we believe to be low risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to reductions in the credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor that we believe is adverse to our investment strategy 
our interest bearing investment portfolio primarily consists of short term  high credit quality money market funds  highly liquid variable rate municipal securities and preferred stock 
these investments totaled approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
our interest bearing investments are not insured and because of the short term high quality nature of the investments are not likely to fluctuate significantly in market value 
for the years ended december  and  we estimate that a hypothetical basis point adverse change in interest rates would have resulted in a million and million decline in the fair value of our portfolio  respectively 
foreign currency risk we are seeking to expand globally in a variety of ways  including our operations in canada  australia  europe and hong kong  and through the development of specially tailored versions of our services 
additionally  we maintain development facilities in israel 
our investments and development activities in these countries expose us to currency exchange fluctuations between the us dollar and the british pound sterling  australian dollar  canadian dollar  euro  hong kong dollar and israeli new shekel 
to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future  our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities 
however  non us dollar cash balances held overseas are generally kept at levels necessary to meet current operating and capitalization needs 
for the years ended december  and  we estimate that a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would have resulted in a million and million loss in revenue from our foreign operations  respectively
