item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company background commscope  inc  through its wholly owned subsidiaries and equity method investee  operates in the cable manufacturing business with manufacturing facilities located in the united states  europe and latin america 
we are a leading worldwide designer  manufacturer and marketer of a wide array of broadband coaxial cables and other high performance electronic and fiber optic cable products for cable television  telephony  internet access and wireless communications 
we believe we are the world s largest manufacturer of coaxial cable for hybrid fiber coax hfc broadband networks 
we are also a leading supplier of coaxial  twisted pair and fiber optic cables for premise wiring local area networks  wireless and other communication applications 
effective november   we acquired an ownership interest in ofs brightwave  llc ofs brightwave  an optical fiber and fiber cable venture between us and the furukawa electric co  ltd 
furukawa 
ofs brightwave was formed to operate a portion of the optical fiber and fiber cable business ofs group acquired from lucent technologies inc lucent 
we issued million shares of commscope  inc common stock  valued at million  to lucent in lieu of a portion of the purchase price payable by furukawa for the acquisition of a portion of lucent s ofs group 
of the amount paid by us  million represented a capital contribution in exchange for our equity interest in ofs brightwave and million represented a loan from one of our wholly owned subsidiaries to ofs brightwave 
the remaining equity interest in ofs brightwave is owned by an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of furukawa 
the businesses acquired include transmission fiber and cable manufacturing capabilities at a million square foot facility in norcross  georgia  as well as facilities in germany and brazil and an interest in a joint venture in carrollton  georgia 
we expect our investment in ofs brightwave and other arrangements with furukawa to provide access to optical fiber  including premium fiber  under a supply agreement  enhance our technology platform with access to key intellectual property  and create a strategic partner in optical fiber and fiber cable manufacturing 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and their underlying assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other objective sources 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revises its estimates  as appropriate  when changes in events or circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary 
significant accounting estimates reflected in our financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory excess and obsolescence reserves  warranty and distributor price protection reserves  reserves for sales returns  discounts  allowances  and rebates  income tax valuation allowances  and impairment reviews for investments  fixed assets  goodwill and other intangibles 
although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management s assumptions about future events  it is at least reasonably possible that they may ultimately differ materially from actual results 
management believes the following critical accounting policies require its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses expected to result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimates are based on management s evaluation of the ability of our customers to make payments  focusing on customer financial difficulties and age of receivable balances 
an adverse change in financial condition of a significant customer or group of customers could materially affect management s estimates related to doubtful accounts 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings  such as discounts  allowances  rebates and distributor price protection programs 
these estimates are based on contract terms  historical experience  inventory levels in the distributor channel  and other factors 
management believes it has sufficient historical experience to allow for reasonable and reliable estimation of these reductions to revenue 
however  declining market conditions could result in increased estimates of sales returns and allowances and potential distributor price protection incentives  resulting in incremental reductions to revenue 
we maintain allowances for excess and obsolete inventory 
these estimates are based on management s assumptions about and analysis of relevant factors including current levels of orders and backlog  shipment experience  forecasted demand and market conditions 
we do not believe our products are subject to a significant risk of obsolescence in the short term and management believes it has the ability to adjust production levels in response to declining demand 
however  if actual market conditions become less favorable than anticipated by management  additional allowances for excess and obsolete inventory could be required 
management reviews goodwill  intangible assets  investments  and other long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable 
management assesses potential impairment of the carrying values of these assets based on market prices  if available  or assumptions about and estimates of future cash flows expected to arise from these assets 
future cash flows may be adversely impacted by operating performance  market conditions  and other factors 
if an impairment is indicated by this analysis  the impairment charge to be recognized  if any  would be measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value  estimated by management based on market prices  if available  or forecasted cash flows  discounted using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
assumptions related to future cash flows and discount rates involve management judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty 
if future cash flows  discount rates and other assumptions used in the assessment and measurement of impairment differ from management s estimates and forecasts  additional impairment charges could be required 
discussion of impairment charges is located under the heading impairment charges for fixed assets and investments within the comparison of results of operations for the year ended december  with the year ended december  see also discussion of new standards for testing goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets for impairment under newly issued accounting standards 
financial highlights for the three year period  we reported the following results in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  net income    net income per share assuming dilution net income for the year ended december  included pretax charges of million  or per diluted share  net of tax  related to impairment of certain fixed assets  including our kings mountain facility and an investment in a wireless infrastructure project management company  now in the process of being liquidated 
the tax benefit of the capital loss arising from impairment of this investment has been offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertainty about our ability to utilize this tax deduction 
these impairment charges were primarily the result of challenging industry conditions which prompted management to make certain estimates and assumptions in order to determine if the carrying values of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
also included in net income for the year ended december  were pretax charges of approximately million  or per diluted share  net of tax  representing financing and formation costs related to our investment in ofs brightwave 
these pretax charges were incurred prior to restructuring the joint venture arrangements with furukawa related to the acquisition of lucent s ofs group and are not capitalizable as part of our investment in the restructured venture 
see further discussion under terminated acquisition costs 
net income for the year ended december  included a pretax gain of thousand related to the final liquidation of a closed australian joint venture 
this joint venture was completely dissolved as of december   when the deregistration period required by australian legal authorities expired 
our consolidated financial statements and related notes  included in item  should be read as an integral part of the financial highlights and the following financial review 
comparison of results of operations for the year ended december  with the year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  decreased million or to million  from the decrease in net sales was mainly due to deteriorating global economic conditions which resulted in declining demand and competitive pricing pressures for some product lines both domestically and internationally 
the following table presents in millions our revenues by broad product group as well as domestic versus international sales for the years ended december  and net of net net of sales sales sales net sales broadband video products lan products wireless other telecom products total worldwide sales domestic sales international sales total worldwide sales for the year ended december   international sales decreased million  or  to million  from  with sales down year over year in all regions primarily due to the difficult global environment 
while we believe that near term international sales will be depressed until the global economy improves  we remain optimistic about the long term global opportunities for broadband cable 
during  we opened a new manufacturing facility in brazil  which we expect will enhance our competitive position in latin america  especially when this region s economy improves 
net sales of broadband and other video distribution products broadband video products for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million  from the decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes  and was significantly affected by the downturn in international demand 
increases in sales to most of the large domestic broadband service providers were more than offset by substantial decreases in sales to alternate service providers and to at t broadband 
domestic broadband video sales decreased approximately year over year 
the decrease in broadband video products sales volume was somewhat offset by modest price increases for certain hfc products 
sales were also positively affected by a favorable shift in product mix resulting from sales of fiber optic cable  primarily for broadband applications  which represented approximately of total sales in however  sales of fiber optic cable slowed during the second half of as a result of challenging market conditions and competitive pricing pressures 
while we expect the market for fiber optic cable to remain difficult during  we believe that our ability to offer both coaxial and fiber optic cable  as well as other types of communications cables  continues to be an important competitive advantage 
we also believe that we will benefit in from the anticipated increase in infrastructure spending announced by at t broadband 
net sales of local area network and other data application products lan products for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  from the increase was primarily due to a favorable shift to more enhanced products at higher unit prices  offset by a decline in unit volume 
net pricing was not a significant factor in the year over year increase in sales of lan products 
we began implementing a comprehensive performance improvement plan for our lan products group during the fourth quarter of this plan included  among other things  reorganizing lan sales and operational management as well as ongoing efforts to reduce distribution channel inventory  improve efficiency  and increase the velocity of the manufacturing and distribution cycle 
this reorganization resulted in growth in both sales and profitability of our lan products and we believe it has improved our ability to provide world class network cabling solutions to our domestic customers 
net sales of wireless and other telecommunications products wireless and other telecom products for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million  from  primarily due to lower sales of other telecom products related to telephone central office applications 
the decrease in sales of other telecom products was primarily driven by lower volumes  offset somewhat by a favorable shift in product mix 
we expect ongoing softness and significant competitive pressures for these other telecom products 
sales of wireless products were down significantly year over year primarily due to the general slowdown in telecommunications capital spending and the inability of certain customers to get financing for their projects 
the decrease in sales of wireless products was primarily driven by lower volumes  and was impacted somewhat by an unfavorable shift in product mix 
during we expanded our global capacity in the wireless market and now have production capability in latin america and europe 
we continue to experience aggressive competition in the wireless market 
gross profit net sales less cost of sales gross profit for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for  a decrease of 
gross profit margin decreased over basis points to for the year ended december   compared to for the decreases in gross profit and gross profit margin were primarily due to lower sales volumes 
changes in material costs did not have a significant impact on gross profit margin 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  from the year over year increase in sg a expense was primarily due to increased charges for doubtful accounts and ongoing investment in our information technology infrastructure 
we recorded charges for doubtful accounts in the amount of approximately million in compared to million in we believe we have taken appropriate charges for doubtful accounts as a result of the difficult market environment based on our analysis of customer financial difficulties  age of receivable balances  and other relevant factors 
we plan to continue investing in our information technology infrastructure in order to further differentiate our service model through technology 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expense was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in sg a expense as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to sales declining faster than sales and marketing expenses  as well as the factors discussed above 
we intend to continue to fund domestic and international sales and marketing efforts in order to enhance our competitive position around the world in anticipation of improving global economic conditions 
research and development research and development expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the substantial completion of certain aspects of our vertical integration projects for bimetallic wire fabrication and fine wire drawing in during  our major projects consisted primarily of research and engineering activity related to the production of copper clad metals required to advance the design of those materials and related processes to the point that they meet specific functional and economic requirements and are ready for full scale manufacturing 
we have undertaken these projects as part of our vertical integration strategy in an effort to reduce materials costs and reliance on limited sources of key raw materials 
these projects were in process as of december  and are expected to continue into in addition  we entered into cross licensing arrangements with furukawa in  providing us with access to key technology for communications cable  especially fiber optic cable  that has taken years to develop 
terminated acquisition costs our acquisition of an ownership interest in ofs brightwave as of november  was restructured from a previously contemplated joint venture arrangement announced july  under the originally contemplated arrangement  we would have formed two joint ventures with furukawa to acquire certain fiber cable and transmission fiber assets of lucent s ofs group 
given the uncertain economic environment and severe downturn in the telecommunications market as well as associated difficulties in the financing markets following the september  tragedy  we agreed with furukawa to restructure the joint venture arrangements  resulting in a reduced ownership participation for us 
as a result of the restructuring of this venture  we recorded pretax charges of approximately million  or per diluted share  net of tax  during  related to financing and formation costs of the original joint venture arrangements  which are not capitalizable as part of our investment in the restructured venture 
impairment charges for fixed assets and investments during  we took a number of steps to manage costs and evaluated all aspects of our business in response to challenging industry conditions 
as a result of our review  we recorded pretax charges of approximately million  or per diluted share  net of tax  during the year ended december  related to the impairment of certain assets 
management identified specific assets that were determined to have no future use in our operations and assets whose anticipated undiscounted future cash flows were less than their carrying values 
these impairment adjustments included equipment charges and a write down of our kings mountain facility  which was under construction 
equipment that was intended for the kings mountain facility is expected to be redeployed overseas 
the impairment charges also included the write off of an investment in a wireless infrastructure project management company  now in the process of being liquidated  whose fair value was determined to be zero 
the tax benefit of the capital loss arising from impairment of this investment has been offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertainty about our ability to utilize this tax deduction 
other income expense  net other income expense  net for the year ended december  included a pretax gain of thousand related to the final liquidation of a closed australian joint venture 
this joint venture was completely dissolved as of december   when the deregistration period required by the australian legal authorities expired 
net interest expense net interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for our weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings  including amortization of associated loan fees  was as of december   compared to as of december  the decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to lower average outstanding balances on long term debt and lower variable interest rates 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was for the year ended december  compared to for the decrease in our effective income tax rate was primarily a result of certain tax savings strategies 
the benefit of these strategies was offset by valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets related to a capital loss carryforward on an investment and a foreign net operating loss carryforward  the realization of which is considered to be uncertain 
we expect the effective income tax rate for to remain at approximately 
equity in losses of ofs brightwave  llc for the six week period from november  to december   our equity interest in the losses of ofs brightwave was approximately million  pretax 
since ofs brightwave has elected to be taxed as a partnership  we have recorded a tax benefit of approximately million related to our equity interest in the flow through losses 
the losses of approximately million incurred by ofs brightwave during the six week period ended december  were impacted by nonrecurring startup and organizational costs of approximately million  related to the write off of in process research and development  separation from lucent and commencement of independent operations 
ofs brightwave operates in the same markets we do and its financial results were also adversely affected by the downturn in the global economy and the telecommunications industry 
in addition  ofs brightwave is party to manufacturing and supply agreements with ofs fitel  llc  which is wholly owned by furukawa 
as a result of furukawa s controlling interest in both ventures  it has significant influence over the structure and pricing of these agreements 
future changes in these terms  over which we have limited influence  could have a material impact on the profitability of ofs brightwave and ultimately on our results of operations and financial condition 
due primarily to the difficult market environment for certain telecommunications products and challenging global economic conditions  we expect ongoing pricing pressure and weak demand industry wide for fiber optic cable products during based on these expectations  we expect that ofs brightwave will incur losses for comparison of results of operations for the year ended december  with the year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  increased million or to million  from the increase in net sales was primarily driven by strong sales of broadband and fiber optic cable for hfc applications 
higher sales volume  combined with price increases on certain hfc products  accounted for the majority of the year over year sales increase 
the following table presents in millions our revenues by broad product group as well as domestic versus international sales for the years ended december  and net of net net of sales sales sales net sales broadband video products lan products wireless other telecom products total worldwide sales domestic sales international sales total worldwide sales for the year ended december   international sales increased compared to  mainly due to robust demand for hfc products around the world  with particular strength in the latin american region 
net sales of broadband video products for the year ended december  increased million or to million  from the increase in sales of broadband video products resulted primarily from strong sales of broadband cable to domestic telecommunications companies and cable television system operators 
most of the increase was attributable to volume with modest price increases on certain products and slight improvement in product mix 
domestic broadband video sales grew approximately year over year  led by strong sales of fiber optic cable 
net sales of lan products for the year ended december  decreased million or to million  from the decrease in sales of lan products was primarily driven by declining unit volume and some decline in prices  offset partially by a favorable shift to more enhanced products with higher average selling prices 
the year over year unit volume decline in sales of lan products was primarily due to a buildup of distribution channel inventory in the first half of  which slowed sales in the second half of the year 
we began implementing a comprehensive performance improvement plan for our lan products group during the fourth quarter of this plan included  among other things  reorganizing lan sales and operational management as well as ongoing efforts to reduce distribution channel inventory  improve efficiency  and increase the velocity of the manufacturing and distribution cycle 
net sales of wireless and other telecom products for the year ended december  increased million or to million  from this increase was primarily due to growth in sales of both telephone central office products and our newest generation wireless cables 
other telecom products declined in terms of volume  but this decline was more than offset by improved product mix 
the volume of wireless products sold increased year over year  but this increase was somewhat reduced by an unfavorable shift in product mix and declining prices 
gross profit net sales less cost of sales gross profit for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for  an increase of 
gross profit margin decreased slightly to for the year ended december   compared to gross profit margin of for while price increases for hfc products had a positive effect on gross profit margin during  they were more than offset by the combination of lower prices for lan products  the rising cost of key materials  and reduced manufacturing efficiency resulting from capacity expansions 
during  supplies of key materials  such as bimetallic center conductors and optical fiber were tight 
a major focus for us in was the acceleration of internal production of bimetallic center conductors for coaxial cables 
while the ramp up of production progressed slower than anticipated  we made significant progress improving output in this project in the second half of selling  general and administrative sg a expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for as a percentage of net sales  sg a expense was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the absolute amount of sg a expense increased over the prior period as a result of the expansion of sales and marketing efforts to support developing products and sales growth targets 
however  as a percentage of net sales  sg a expense decreased in compared to  as a result of increased sales levels and effective cost management efforts 
research and development research and development expense as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to our vertical integration projects for bimetallic wire fabrication and fine wire drawing 
we have undertaken these projects as part of our vertical integration strategy in an effort to reduce materials costs and reliance on limited sources of key raw materials 
other income expense  net other income expense  net for the year ended december  included a pretax gain of thousand related to the final liquidation of a closed australian joint venture 
this joint venture was completely dissolved as of december   when the deregistration period required by the australian legal authorities expired 
net interest expense net interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for our weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings  including amortization of associated loan fees  was as of december   compared to as of december  income taxes our effective income tax rate was for the year ended december  and for this slight increase was primarily due to the dilution of our foreign sales corporation tax benefit  a result of strong domestic sales and increasing sales from our belgium facility  and higher tax rates in foreign jurisdictions  particularly belgium 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity both on a short term and long term basis are cash flows provided by operations and borrowing capacity under credit facilities 
reduced sales and profitability could reduce the availability of cash provided by operations 
in addition  increases in sales and accounts receivable could reduce our operating cash flows in the short term until cash collections catch up to the higher level of billings 
cash provided by operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from this increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to reduced working capital on lower sales 
the most significant impact on operating cash flow during was derived from collections of accounts receivable in excess of billings 
working capital decreased to million at december   from million at december  the decrease in working capital was primarily due to lower accounts receivable  resulting from collections in excess of billings due to declining sales 
lower inventory levels resulting from reduced demand for our products also contributed to reduced working capital 
the decrease in other accrued liabilities in  which increased working capital  was primarily due to lower accrued compensation costs related to employee incentive plans 
during the year ended december   we invested million in equipment and facilities compared to million in the capital spending during and was primarily for projects related to vertical integration  capacity expansion  and equipment upgrades 
we have completed an aggressive three year capacity expansion program that increased our overall production capability in order to position ourselves to meet anticipated worldwide demand for hfc products 
while we may place additional production capability in important international markets  we expect capital expenditures to remain at a level below depreciation and amortization expense for the next several years 
we currently expect capital expenditures to be in the range of to million in  primarily for global capacity expansion and information technology initiatives  depending upon business conditions 
as of december   we had committed funds of approximately million under purchase orders and contracts related to vertical integration projects and equipment and capacity upgrades to meet current and anticipated future business demands 
during the fourth quarter of  we made a strategic investment by joining with furukawa to acquire an interest in a portion of the optical fiber and fiber cable business of lucent s ofs group 
we acquired an ownership interest  valued at million in ofs brightwave  which includes transmission fiber and fiber cable manufacturing capabilities at a million square foot facility in norcross  georgia  as well as facilities in germany and brazil and an interest in a joint venture in carrollton  georgia 
the acquisition of our million ownership interest and a million note receivable was financed in a noncash transaction by issuing million shares of commscope  inc common stock valued at million to lucent 
we also incurred direct costs of acquisition of million in  which were capitalized in our investment balance as of december  although we are not required to make any additional cash investments in the form of loans or capital contributions to ofs brightwave  our failure to do so could result in the dilution of our ownership percentage 
in addition  we have a contractual right to sell our ownership interest to furukawa in for a cash payment to us of our original million capital investment and an acceleration of repayment of the note receivable 
ofs brightwave is party to manufacturing and supply agreements with ofs fitel  llc  which is wholly owned by furukawa 
as a result of furukawa s controlling interest in both ventures  it has significant influence over the structure and pricing of these agreements 
future changes in these terms  over which we have limited influence  could have a material impact on the profitability of ofs brightwave and ultimately on the results of our operations and financial condition 
in addition  we are party to an optical fiber supply agreement with ofs fitel  llc which provides us with another source for our optical fiber requirements 
the pricing under this arrangement is based on market prices  adjusted periodically as agreed upon by the parties 
we made no purchases under this supply agreement during during  we made an investment of approximately million in a wireless infrastructure project management company 
our investment in this company  now in the process of being liquidated  was determined to have no realizable value by the end of  and was completely written off as an impaired asset 
our revolving credit agreement  which expires in december  provides a total of million in revolving credit commitments in the form of loans and letters of credit 
our available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement  determined on a quarterly basis  is based on certain financial ratios which are affected by the level of long term debt outstanding and our profitability 
as of december   we had no outstanding indebtedness under this revolving credit agreement and our available borrowing capacity was approximately million 
we owed total long term debt of million  or of our book capital structure  defined as long term debt and total stockholders equity  as of december   compared to million  or of our book capital structure  as of december  the decrease in long term debt during was primarily due to the repayment of million under our revolving credit agreement  in addition to repayments of million and favorable foreign currency transaction gains on our eurodollar credit agreement of approximately million  which were recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
our revolving credit agreement contains covenants requiring us to maintain a total debt to ebitda ratio  a net worth maintenance ratio  and an interest expense ratio 
our performance under these covenants could impact our cost of funds and our noncompliance with these covenants could negatively impact our access to funds available under that facility 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  however  we expect the market for fiber optic cable to remain difficult during  and if our share of losses in ofs brightwave is significant  we may be at risk of noncompliance with these covenants 
this revolving credit agreement expires in december and we do not currently anticipate difficulty securing new financing on acceptable terms 
market risk we have established a risk management strategy that includes the reasonable use of derivative and nonderivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to market risks resulting from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
derivative financial instruments which may be used by us  include commodity pricing contracts  foreign currency exchange contracts  and contracts hedging exposure to interest rates 
our policy is to designate all derivatives as hedges 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes  nor do we engage in speculation 
materials  in their finished form  account for a large portion of our cost of sales 
these materials  such as fabricated aluminum  plastics  bimetals  copper and optical fiber  are subject to changes in market price as they are linked to the commodity markets 
management attempts to mitigate these risks through effective requirements planning and by working closely with our key suppliers to obtain the best possible pricing and delivery terms 
however  increases in the prices of certain commodity products could result in higher overall production costs 
approximately of our sales were to customers located outside the united states 
although we primarily bill customers in foreign countries in us dollars  a portion of our sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  particularly sales from our foreign subsidiaries 
significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our international sales levels and the related collection of amounts due 
in addition  a significant decline in the value of currencies used in certain regions of the world as compared to the us dollar could adversely affect product sales in those regions because our products may become more expensive for those customers to pay for in their local currency 
the acquisition of our belgian subsidiary created a specific market risk that a decline in the value of the euro compared to the us dollar could adversely affect our net investment in that subsidiary 
our eurodollar credit agreement  which is denominated in euros  serves as a partial hedge of our net investment in the belgian subsidiary 
our investment in brazil during created a new foreign subsidiary and a specific market risk that a decline in the value of the brazilian real compared to the us dollar could adversely affect our net investment in that subsidiary 
we continue to evaluate alternatives to help us reasonably manage the market risk of our net investment in the brazilian subsidiary 
as of december  and  the only derivative financial instrument outstanding was an interest rate swap agreement that serves as a fixed rate hedge of the variable rate borrowings under our eurodollar credit agreement  as required under the covenants of this term loan 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement outstanding at december  and was not material to our financial position 
at december   we were continuing to evaluate hedging alternatives related to foreign currency exposures 
in addition  we evaluated our commodity pricing exposures and concluded that it was not currently practical to use derivative financial instruments to hedge our current commodity price risks 
our nonderivative financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  trade payables  and debt instruments 
at december  and  the carrying values of each of the financial instruments recorded on our balance sheet were considered representative of their respective fair values due to their variable interest rates and or short terms to maturity  with the exception of our convertible debt  which was recorded in the financial statements at million  but had a fair value of million at december  and million at december  fair value of our debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis  based on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of arrangements  or quoted market prices whenever available 
the following tables summarize our market risks associated with long term debt and foreign currency exposure as of december  and the tables present principal and interest cash outflows and related interest rates by year of maturity 
variable interest rates for each year represent the interest rate effective for the related loan as of december  for the first table and as of december  for the second table 
however  the interest rate on the eurodollar credit agreement for both years is fixed at  since we have designated an interest rate swap agreement as a fixed rate hedge of the variable rate borrowings under this agreement  as required by its terms 
the interest cash outflows for the eurodollar credit agreement  disclosed below  include the effect of the interest rate swap agreement  which effectively converts the variable interest payments to a fixed rate basis 
in addition  foreign currency exchange rates on our eurodollar credit agreement  for both principal and interest payments  are based on the exchange rate as of december  for the first table and as of december  for the second table 
the tables assume payments will be made in accordance with due dates in the respective agreements and no prepayment of any amounts due  with the exception of the prepayment of million under our revolving credit agreement in early the tabular format used below does not reflect our option to redeem all or a portion of the million convertible notes at any time on or after december  at redemption prices specified in the indenture  or our option to prepay the eurodollar credit agreement in whole or in part at any time prior to the due date of march  long term debt principal and interest payments by year in millions as of december  there total fair after value fixed rate us average interest rate variable rate us average interest rate fixed rate eur average interest rate as of december  there total fair after value fixed rate us average interest rate variable rate us average interest rate variable rate us average interest rate fixed rate eur average interest rate contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  in millions amount of payments due per period contractual obligations total less than years years after payments due year years long term debt operating leases a total contractual cash obligations a the contractual obligations related to operating leases include payments due under a five year tax advantaged operating lease for our corporate office building 
at the end of the initial lease term  or renewal term s if renewed  if we should decide not to purchase the facility for the total construction cost of million  we are obligated to pay a final lease payment of approximately million and to market the facility on behalf of the lessor 
any proceeds received from the sale of the facility would first be used to reimburse the lessor for the difference between the total construction cost of the facility and the final lease payment 
any remaining sales proceeds would be retained by us 
effects of inflation we continually attempt to minimize any effect of inflation on earnings by controlling our operating costs and selling prices 
during the past few years  the rate of inflation has been low and has not had a material impact on our results of operations 
the principal raw materials purchased by us fabricated aluminum  plastics  bimetals  copper and optical fiber are subject to changes in market price as these materials are linked to the commodity markets 
to the extent that we are unable to pass on cost increases to customers  the cost increases could have a significant impact on the results of our operations 
other we are either a plaintiff or a defendant in pending legal matters in the normal course of business  however  we believe none of these legal matters will have a materially adverse effect on our financial statements upon final disposition 
in addition  we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations governing the use  discharge and disposal of hazardous materials 
our manufacturing facilities are believed to be in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations 
compliance with current laws and regulations has not had  and is not expected to have  a materially adverse effect on our financial statements 
newly issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
both statements are effective for us on january  sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires the use of a nonamortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and also requires at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
intangible assets with definite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the adoption of these statements will have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position after december  when goodwill will no longer be amortized 
the pretax impact on our results of operations and financial position of adopting a nonamortization approach to accounting for goodwill under sfas no 
is expected to be approximately million per year 
we are currently assessing the impact of the other provisions of these two statements  which will be adopted in in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
sfas no 
will require the accrual  at fair value  of the estimated retirement obligation for tangible long lived assets if we are legally obligated to perform retirement activities at the end of the related asset s life 
we are currently assessing the impact of this statement  which will be effective for us on january  in october  the fasb issued sfas no

is effective for us on january  the initial adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
european monetary union euro effective january   member countries of the european monetary union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies  and adopted the euro as their new common legal currency 
as of that date  the euro began trading on currency exchanges 
the legacy currencies of the participating countries remained legal tender for a transition period between january  and january  we conduct business in member countries 
during the transition period  cashless payments for example  wire transfers could be made in the euro  and parties to individual transactions could elect to pay for goods and services using either the euro or the legacy currency 
between january  and february   the participating countries introduced euro notes and coins and will eventually withdraw all legacy currencies so that they will no longer be available 
european legislation provides that  unless otherwise agreed  the introduction of the euro will not  by itself  give any party to a contract the right to terminate the contract  or to demand renegotiation of the terms 
as of december   we believe we have adequately addressed the issues involved with the introduction of the euro 
among the issues which we faced were the assessment and conversion of information technology systems to allow for transactions to take place in both the legacy currencies and the euro and the eventual elimination of legacy currencies 
we have also modified certain existing contracts  if required  and have revised our pricing marketing strategies in the affected european markets to the extent necessary for the introduction of the euro 
in addition  our belgian subsidiary successfully completed the conversion of its financial systems and share capital to the euro 
we do not believe the euro conversion has had or will have a materially adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition
