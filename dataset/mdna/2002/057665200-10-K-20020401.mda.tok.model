recently issued statements of financial accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations completed after june  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual value  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
immediately and adopted sfas no 
effective january  goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  were amortized through the end of in connection with the transitional impairment evaluation  sfas no 
will require the company to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired as of january  because of the extensive effort needed to comply with the adoption of sfas no 
 further evaluation is still needed to complete the transitional goodwill impairment test provisions  however preliminary indicators are that adoption of the new standards should not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
the assessment process will be completed no later than june  and the recording of any impairment loss will be completed as soon as possible but no later than the end of any transitional impairment loss  if any  will be recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s statement of earnings 
as of december   the company has unamortized goodwill in the amount of  and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of approximately  all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas nos 
and amortization expenses related to goodwill was and for years ended december  and  respectively

 managment has evaluated the company s intangible assets and determined that the company has no indefinite useful life intangibles 
the company has also evaluated the remaining useful lives of its intangible assets that will continue to be amortized and has determined that no revision to the useful lives will be required 
beginning january   in accordance with sfas no 
 the company is no longer recording amortization expense related to goodwill 
although goodwill will no longer be systematically amortized  periodic reviews will need to be conducted to assess whether or not the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
such reviews could result in future write downs of goodwill which would be reflected as a charge against operating income 
in august the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
however  sfas retains the fundamental provisions of sfas for a recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and b measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  sfas retains the requirement of opinion to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  by abandonment  or in distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
sfas also amends arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a temporarily controlled subsidiary 
the company is required to adopt sfas effective january  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas for long lived assets held for sale to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements because the impairment assessment under sfas is largely unchanged from sfas the provisions of this statement for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities and therefore  will depend on future actions initiated by management 
as a result  the company cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of sfas will have on its financial statements with respect to future disposal decisions  if any
