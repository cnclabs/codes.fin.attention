these forward looking statements are made based on management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events  as well as on assumptions made by and data currently available to management 
therefore  these forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance 
a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from the anticipated or expected results expressed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could affect future performance include  but are not limited  to current political and economic conditions  changes in political and economic conditions that may occur in the future  continued terrorist activities in the united states  as well as the potential escalation in the international war on terrorism  changes in consumer confidence resulting in a reduction of discretionary spending on goods that are  or are perceived to be  luxuries  changes in demographic or retail environments  changes in consumer preferences or fashion trends  competitive responses to the company s marketing  merchandising and promotional efforts and or inventory liquidations by vendors or other retailers  seasonality of the retail business  adverse weather conditions  particularly during peak selling seasons  delays in anticipated store openings  natural disasters  significant increases in paper  printing and postage costs  litigation that may have an adverse effect on the financial results or reputation of the company  changes in the company s relationships with designers  vendors and other sources of merchandise  the financial viability of the company s designers  vendors and other sources of merchandise  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in the company s relationships with certain of its key sales associates

the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly or otherwise any forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events  new information or future circumstances 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  actual results will differ from those estimates 
management makes adjustments to its assumptions and judgments when facts and circumstances dictate 
the amounts currently estimated by the company are subject to change if different assumptions as to the outcome of future events were made 
the company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and predicates those estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management of the company believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  encompass the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenues from the company s retail operations are recognized at the later of the point of sale or the delivery of goods to the customer 
revenues from the company s direct marketing operations are recognized when the merchandise is delivered to the customer 
both retail and direct marketing revenues are reduced by a provision for anticipated returns primarily based on the company s historical trends related to returns by its customers 
cost of sales and merchandise inventories 
the company utilizes the retail inventory method of accounting for substantially all of its merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined using the first in  first out basis  or market using the retail inventory method 
the retail inventory method is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio  for various groupings of similar items  to the retail value of inventories 
the cost of the inventory reflected on the consolidated balance sheet is decreased by charges to cost of sales at the time the retail value of the inventory is lowered through the use of markdowns 
hence  earnings are negatively impacted as the merchandise is marked down prior to sale 
the areas requiring significant management judgment related to the valuation of the company s inventories include setting the original retail value for the merchandise held for sale  recognizing merchandise for which the customer s perception of value has declined and appropriately marking the retail value of the merchandise down to the perceived value and estimating the shrinkage that has occurred between physical inventory counts 
these judgments and estimates  coupled with the averaging processes within the retail method can  under certain circumstances  produce varying financial results 
factors that can lead to different financial results include setting original retail values for merchandise held for sale incorrectly  failure to identify a decline in the perceived value of inventories and to process the appropriate retail value markdowns and overly optimistic or conservative shrinkage estimates 
the company believes it has the appropriate merchandise valuation and pricing controls in place to minimize the risk that its inventory values would be materially misstated 

table of contents income and expenses related to securitization 
pursuant to applicable accounting principles  the company s current credit card securitization program qualifies for sale treatment related to those receivables transferred to third party investors sold interests 
as a result  the company recognizes a gain or loss equal to the difference between the consideration received for the sold interests and the allocated cost basis of the receivables sold 
the portion of the credit card receivables that continue to be held by the company retained interests are shown as undivided interests in nmg credit card trust on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
assumptions related to the future performance of the company s credit card portfolio have a significant impact on the calculation of the gain or loss on the sale of the sold interests  the carrying values of retained interests and the recognition of income on the retained interests 
determining the fair value of the sold and retained interests requires estimates related to the gross future finance charge collections to be generated by the total portfolio  future finance charge collections allocable to the sold interests  future credit losses and discount rates 
items that were considered in making judgments and preparing estimates and factors that might lead to future variations in consolidated financial results in the event of differences between actual and estimated results are as follows finance charge income is billed at a contractual rate monthly and warrants little judgment or estimation 
the expected credit card customer payment rate is based on historical payment rates adjusted for recent payment rate trends 
to the extent credit card customers pay off their balances sooner than estimated  the income earned by the company is reduced 
conversely  should the credit card customers pay off balances over a longer period of time  the income earned by the company may increase 
the finance charge collections are estimated using the current portfolio yield experience and estimated short term interest rates over the estimated life of the receivables 
to the extent current portfolio yield experience decreases and short term interest rates increase beyond the estimates  the finance charge collections may be reduced 
credit losses expected from the portfolio are based on historical write off rates  adjusted for recent write off trends and increased or decreased to reflect management s outlook of future trends 
to the extent there are positive or negative factors affecting the credit card customers ability or intent to pay off the outstanding balance eg  level of discretionary income  level of consumer debt  bankruptcy legislation  the actual bad debts to be realized could exceed or be less than the amounts estimated 
credit losses in excess of those embedded in the estimates reduce the income earned by the company 
conversely  credit losses less than those embedded increase the income earned by the company 
the assumed cash flow discount rates are based on prevailing market interest rates and management s estimate of an appropriate risk premium for each respective retained interest 
the actual discount rates used are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
the most sensitive assumptions in calculating the fair values are the credit card customers payment rate  the estimate for credit losses  relative interest spreads and the assumed cash flow discount rates 
impairment of long lived assets 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of its long lived assets  the company performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  the company reduces the carrying value to its fair value  which is generally calculated using discounted future cash flows 
various factors  including future sales growth and profit margins  are included in this analysis 
to the extent these future projections or the company s strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the company s current estimates 
advertising and catalogue costs 
the company s direct response advertising relates primarily to the production  printing and distribution of catalogues 
these costs are amortized during the periods the expected revenues from such catalogues are expected to be generated  generally three to six months 
all other advertising costs  including costs incurred by the company s online operations related to website design and advertising  are expensed in the period incurred 

table of contents loyalty program 
the company maintains customer loyalty programs in which customers receive points annually for qualifying purchases 
upon reaching certain levels  customers may redeem their points for gifts 
generally  points earned in a given year must be redeemed no later than ninety days subsequent to the end of the annual program period 
the company accrues the estimated costs of the anticipated redemptions of the points earned by its customers at the time of the initial customer purchase and charges such costs to selling  general and administrative expense 
the estimates of the costs associated with the loyalty programs require the company to make assumptions related to customer purchasing levels  redemption rates and costs of awards to be chosen by its customers 
income taxes 
the company does business in various jurisdictions that impose income taxes 
management determines the aggregate amount of income tax expense to accrue and the amount currently payable based upon the tax statutes of each jurisdiction 
this process involves adjusting income determined using generally accepted accounting principles for items that are treated differently by the applicable taxing authorities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected on the company s balance sheet for temporary differences that will reverse in subsequent years 
if different judgments had been made  the company s tax expense  assets and liabilities could have been different 
other estimates 
management uses estimates in the determination of the required accruals for general liability  workers compensation and health insurance as well as short term disability  pension and postretirement health care benefits 
these estimates are based upon examination of historical trends  industry claims experience and  in certain cases  calculations performed by third party experts 
projected claims information may change in the future and may require management to revise these accruals 
the company is periodically involved in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
management is required to assess the probability of any adverse judgments as well as the potential range of any losses 
management determines the required accruals after a careful review of the facts of each legal action 
the company s accruals may change in the future due to new developments in these matters

fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
revenues for fiscal year of billion decreased million  or percent  from billion in the prior year 
total revenues for fiscal year included sales of approximately million for the fifty third week of fiscal the decrease in revenues in fiscal year was primarily attributable to a percent decrease in comparable revenues for the fifty two weeks ended july  compared to the fifty two weeks ended july  the comparable sales decrease was offset  in part  by the revenues from one new neiman marcus store in tampa  florida and one new clearance store in atlanta  georgia  each of which was opened during the first quarter of fiscal year in addition  the company opened a new clearance store in grapevine  texas in april comparable revenues for the fifty two weeks ended july  compared to the fifty two weeks ended july  decreased percent for specialty retail stores  offset  in part by an increase of percent for direct marketing 
the company believes the decline in comparable revenues for specialty retail stores for the fifty two weeks ended july  compared to the fifty two weeks ended july  was due  in part  to the elimination of certain promotional events conducted in fiscal year in order to lower inventory levels  general economic conditions  the softening in the retail industry that began in fiscal year and a decrease in retail spending after the events of september  the net increase in comparable revenues for direct marketing reflects an increase in revenues from the company s online operations offset  in part  by a decline in revenues from the direct marketing catalogue operations 
as to the direct marketing catalogue operations  the company believes the decrease in its comparable revenues for the fifty two weeks ended july  compared to the fifty two weeks ended july  was impacted by the planned reduction in circulation schedules  the elimination of certain catalogues  general economic conditions and a decrease in retail spending after the events of september  comparable revenues for the brand development companies declined in fiscal year with a decrease for kate spade llc being offset  in part  by an increase for gurwitch bristow products  llc 
gross margin

however  markdowns were lower in the third quarter and fourth quarter of fiscal year than in the same periods in fiscal year in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  the company was able to eliminate certain markdowns taken in connection with promotional events that were held in the prior year to lower inventory levels in response to the lower than anticipated sales levels achieved in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses

the increases in sg a were partially offset by a lower level of sg a as a percentage of revenues for the company s more mature stores due  in part  to various cost reduction strategies initiated by the company  lower catalogue production and circulation costs due to the elimination of certain unprofitable catalogues by direct marketing and higher income received in connection with the company s undivided interests in the nmg credit card master trust as a result of a decline in interest rates 
segment operating earnings

further  in the event of termination  an employee was entitled to receive cash compensation to the extent of the untaken balance of the annual grant 
as a result  the company recorded vacation expense ratably over the twelve months prior to each annual grant such that the liability for the annual grant was fully recorded as of the grant date 
with the termination of the prior vacation plan  the previously recorded vacation liability of million  which amount represented the vacation time that would have been granted to employees on april  pursuant to the previous plan  was eliminated and credited to operating earnings in the third quarter of fiscal year the new policy will not have a material impact on the amount of vacation expense recorded by the company on an annual basis in the future
