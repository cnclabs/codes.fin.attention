item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources as of and for the years ended march   and the following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
our results of operations are susceptible to fluctuations for a number of reasons  including  without limitation  customer demand for our products and services  supplier costs  interest rate fluctuations and differences between estimated residual values and actual amounts realized related to the equipment we lease 
operating results could also fluctuate as a result of the sale of equipment in our lease portfolio prior to the expiration of the lease term to the lessee or to a third party 
such sales of leased equipment prior to the expiration of the lease term may have the effect of increasing revenues and net earnings during the period in which the sale occurs  and reducing revenues and net earnings otherwise expected in subsequent periods 
we currently derive the majority of our revenue from sales and financing of information technology and other assets 
we have expanded our product and service offerings under the enterprise cost management model which represents the continued evolution of our original implementation of eplus e commerce products entitled eplussuite 
the expansion to our ecm model is framework that combines our it sales and professional services  leasing and financing services  asset management software and services  procurement software  and electronic catalog content management software and services 
we have expanded our sales and marketing personnel from to from both hiring personnel and from the acquisitions of sourceone computer corporation and elcom international  inc these two acquisitions and our hiring of other sales persons has expanded our current locations to  all of which are in the united states 
we expect to expand or open new sales locations and hire additional staff for specific targeted market areas in the near future whenever we can find both experienced personnel and qualified geographic areas 
on may   we acquired from procurenet  inc the e commerce procurement software asset products and software technology for cleaning and categorizing product descriptions for e commerce catalogues 
these products and services and associated expenses with this business acquisition have substantially increased our expenses and the ability to sell these services and products is expected to fluctuate depending on the customer demand for these products and services  which to date is still unproven 
these products and services are included in our technology sales unit business segment combined with our other sales of it products and services 
our leasing and financing activities are included in our financing business unit segment in our financial statements 
as a result of our acquisitions and expansion of sales locations  the company s historical results of operations and financial position may not be indicative of its future performance over time 
selected accounting policies the manner in which lease finance transactions are characterized and reported for accounting purposes has a major impact upon reported revenue and net earnings 
lease accounting methods significant to our business are discussed below 
we classify our lease transactions  as required by the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases  or fasb no 
 as direct financing  sales type  or operating leases 
revenues and expenses between accounting periods for each lease term will vary depending upon the lease classification 
for financial statement purposes  we present revenue from all three classifications in lease revenues  and costs related to these leases in direct lease costs 
direct financing and sales type leases 
direct financing and sales type leases transfer substantially all benefits and risks of equipment ownership to the customer 
a lease is a direct financing or sales type lease if the creditworthiness of the customer and the collectibility of lease payments are reasonably certain and it meets one of the following criteria the lease transfers ownership of the equipment to the customer by the end of the lease term  the lease contains a bargain purchase option  the lease term at inception is at least of the estimated economic life of the leased equipment  or the present value of the minimum lease payments is at least of the fair market value of the leased equipment at the inception of the lease 
direct finance leases are recorded as investment in direct financing leases upon acceptance of the equipment by the customer 
at the inception of the lease  unearned lease income is recorded which represents the amount by which the gross lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the equipment exceeds the equipment cost 
unearned lease income is recognized  using the interest method  as lease revenue over the lease term 
sales type leases include a dealer profit or loss that is recorded by the lessor at the inception of the lease 
the dealer s profit or loss represents the difference  at the inception of the lease  between the fair value of the leased property and its cost or carrying amount 
the equipment subject to such leases may be obtained in the secondary marketplace  but most frequently is the result of re leasing our own portfolio 
this profit or loss that is recognized at lease inception is included in net margin on sales type leases 
for equipment supplied from our technology business unit subsidiaries  the dealer margin is presented in equipment sales revenue and cost of equipment sales 
interest earned on the present value of the lease payments and residual value is recognized over the lease term using the interest method and is included as part of our lease revenues 
operating leases 
all leases that do not meet the criteria to be classified as direct financing or sales type leases are accounted for as operating leases 
rental amounts are accrued on a straight line basis over the lease term and are recognized as lease revenue 
our cost of the leased equipment is recorded on the balance sheet as investment in leases and leased equipment and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term to our estimate of residual value 
revenue  depreciation expense and the resulting profit for operating leases are recorded on a straight line basis over the life of the lease 
as a result of these three classifications of leases for accounting purposes  the revenues resulting from the mix of lease classifications during an accounting period will affect the profit margin percentage for such period and such profit margin percentage generally increases as revenues from direct financing and sales type leases increase 
should a lease be financed  the interest expense declines over the term of the financing as the principal is reduced 
residual values 
residual values represent our estimated value of the equipment at the end of the initial lease term 
the residual values for direct financing and sales type leases are recorded in investment in direct financing and sales type leases  on a net present value basis 
the residual values for operating leases are included in the leased equipment s net book value and are recorded in investment in operating lease equipment 
the estimated residual values will vary  both in amount and as a percentage of the original equipment cost  and depend upon several factors  including the equipment type  manufacturer s discount  market conditions and the term of the lease 
we evaluate residual values on an ongoing basis and record any required changes in accordance with fasb no 
residual values are affected by equipment supply and demand and by new product announcements and price changes by manufacturers 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  residual value estimates are adjusted downward when such assets are impaired 
we seek to realize the estimated residual value at lease termination through renewal or extension of the original lease  sale of the equipment either to the lessee or the secondary market  or lease of the equipment to a new user 
the difference between the proceeds of a sale and the remaining estimated residual value is recorded as a gain or loss in lease revenues when title is transferred to the lessee  or  if the equipment is sold on the secondary market  in equipment sales revenues and cost of equipment sales when title is transferred to the buyer 
the proceeds from any subsequent lease are accounted for as lease revenues at the time such transaction is entered into 
initial direct costs 
initial direct costs related to the origination of direct financing  sales type or operating leases are capitalized and recorded as part of the net investment in direct financing leases  or net operating lease equipment  and are amortized over the lease term 
sales 
sales revenue includes the following types of transactions sales of new or used equipment which is not subject to any type of lease  sales of equipment subject to an existing lease  under which we are lessor  including any underlying financing related to the lease  sales of off lease equipment to the secondary market  and sales of procurement software 
sales of new or used equipment are recognized upon shipment 
sales of equipment subject to an existing lease and off lease equipment are recognized when constructive title passes to the purchaser 
revenue from sales of procurement software is recognized in accordance with the statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop we recognize revenue when all the following criteria exist when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  no significant obligations by the company with regard to implementation remain  the sales price is determinable and it is probable that collection will occur 
our accounting policy requires that revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements be allocated to each element on the relative fair values of the elements and recognized when earned 
revenue relative to maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the maintenance term usually one year and revenue allocated to training  implementation or other services is recognized as the services are performed 
other sources of revenue 
amounts charged for procure are recognized as services are rendered 
amounts charged for the manage service are recognized on a straight line basis over the period the services are provided 
fee and other income results from income from events that occur after the initial sale of a financial asset  re marketing fees  brokerage fees earned for the placement of financing transactions  and interest and other miscellaneous income 
these revenues are included in fee and other income in our consolidated statements of earnings 
capitalization of software costs for internal use 
the company has capitalized certain costs for the development of internal use software under the guidelines of statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
approximately  million and million of internal use software was capitalized during the years ended march  and  respectively which is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as a component of property and equipment 
capitalization of software costs available to customers 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at such time such costs are capitalized until the product is made available for release to customers 
no development costs have been capitalized for the years ended march  or relative to software costs available to customers 
results of operations the year ended march  compared to the year ended march  total revenues generated by the company during the year ended march  were million compared to revenues of million for the year ended march   a decrease of 
this decrease is primarily attributable to decreased revenues from the sales of equipment and leased equipment  offset slightly by an increase in lease revenues and fee and other income 
the company s revenues are composed of sales  lease revenues  and fee and other income  and may vary considerably from period to period 
sales revenue  which includes sales of equipment and sales of leased equipment  decreased to million during the year ended march   as compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the majority of sales of equipment are generated through the company s technology business unit subsidiaries 
sales of used and or off lease equipment are also generated from the company s brokerage and re marketing activities 
for the year ended march   we experienced a marked decrease in customer demand for it products due to an overall economic slowdown 
the decrease was a result of generally slower sales within the company s existing customer base and the reduction in sales to customers in the communications industry 
for the year ended march   equipment sales through the company s technology business unit subsidiaries accounted for of sales of equipment 
for the year ended march   sales of equipment decreased to million  a result of decreased technology sales through the company s subsidiaries 
the company realized a gross margin on sales of equipment of for the year ended march   as compared to during the year ended march  this decrease in net margin percentage can be attributed to increased competition in a slower marketplace  lower overall demand in the marketplace  and variations in the profitability on the mix and volume of products sold 
the company also recognizes revenue from the sale of leased equipment 
during the year ended march  compared to the prior fiscal year  sales of leased equipment decreased to million 
during the year ended march   the company recognized a gross margin of on leased equipment sales as compared to a gross margin of during the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in sales of leased equipment for the year ended march  reflects the reduced volume of lease equipment sold to outside investors  although the transactions which were sold reflected a higher gross margin 
leases that are not equity sold to investors remain on the company s books and lease earnings are recognized accordingly 
in addition  the revenue and gross margin recognized on sales of leased equipment can vary significantly depending on the nature and timing of the sale  as well as the timing of any debt funding recognized in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
prior to may  the majority of the company s sales of lease equipment had historically been sold to mlc clc  llc  a joint venture in which the company owns a interest 
during the years ended march  and  sales to mlc clc  llc  accounted for and of sales of leased equipment  respectively 
sales to the joint venture required the consent of the joint venture partner 
firstar equipment finance corporation  which owns of mlc clc  llc  discontinued their investment in new lease acquisitions effective may the company has developed and will continue to develop relationships with additional lease equity investors and financial intermediaries to diversify its sources of equity financing 
the company s lease revenues increased to million for the year ended march   compared with the prior fiscal year 
this increase reflects increased remarketing revenues on the company s maturing lease portfolio 
our net investment in leased assets was million at march   a decrease from million at march  for the year ended march   fee and other income was million  an increase of over the prior fiscal year 
fee and other income includes eplussuite revenues  revenues from adjunct services and management fees  including broker fees  support fees  warranty reimbursements  and learning center revenues generated by the company s technology business unit subsidiaries 
the increase in fee and other income in the year ended march  includes an approximate million rebate from one of the company s equipment vendors 
the company s fee and other income contains earnings from certain transactions which are in the company s normal course of business but there is no guarantee that future transactions of the same nature  size or profitability will occur 
the company s ability to consummate such transactions  and the timing thereof  may depend largely upon factors outside the direct control of management 
the earnings from these types of transactions in a particular period may not be indicative of the earnings that can be expected in future periods 
for the year ended march   included in fee and other income were million in eplussuite revenues  as compared to million in the year ended march  this represents a decrease of and reflects a reduction of transactions utilizing our eplussuite products and services 
these revenues consist of amounts charged for the arrangement of procurement transactions executed through procure  and manage  components of eplussuite 
the company s direct lease costs decreased during the year ended march   as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the largest component of direct lease costs is depreciation expense on operating lease equipment 
professional and other fees decreased for the year ended march  over the the prior fiscal year  and was primarily the result of a material reduction in the utilization of outside service providers 
salaries and benefits expenses increased during the year ended march   as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase is the result of the increased number of personnel employed by the company  particularly employees acquired in the sourceone acquisition  which is offset by reduced commission expenses in the company s lease financing and technology sales units 
general and administrative expenses increased over the prior fiscal year 
the increase reflects the additional expense related to the company s recently formed subsidiaries  eplus systems  inc 
and eplus content services  inc 
a portion of the increase is attributable to the non recurring  one time write off of certain software assets and an equity investment held in a former business partner of the company  as the company determined that the investment net book value would not be realized 
in addition  the company has experienced increased expenses related to the development and deployment of its e commerce strategy 
these increases have been offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization for the current fiscal year 
interest and financing costs incurred by the company for the year ended march  decreased  and relate to interest costs on the company s indebtedness 
in addition to decreased borrowing under the company s lines of credit  the company s lease related non recourse debt portfolio decreased significantly  and our weighted average interest rate on new lease related non recourse debt decreased during the year ended march  see liquidity and capital resources 
payment for interest costs on the majority of non recourse and certain recourse notes are typically remitted directly to the lender by the lessee

basic and fully diluted earnings per common share were and for the year ended march   as compared to and for the year ended march   based on weighted average common shares outstanding of  and  respectively  for and  and  respectively  for liquidity and capital resources during the year ended march   the company generated cash flows from operations of million  and used cash flows from investing activities of million 
cash flows generated by financing activities amounted to million during the same period 
the net effect of these cash flows was a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million during the year 
during the same period  our total assets decreased million  or  primarily the result of decreases in the company s net investmentin leases and leased equipment 
on april   a secondary offering of  shares of our common stock was completed that generated net proceeds of  the company s net investments in direct financing and operating lease equipment decreased million  or  and million  or  respectively  during the period 
the cash balance at march  was million as compared to million the prior year 
the company s debt financing activities typically provide approximately to of the purchase price of the equipment purchased by the company for lease to its customers 
any balance of the purchase price the company s equity investment in the equipment must generally be financed by cash flow from its operations  the sale of the equipment leased to third parties  or other internal means 
although the company expects that the credit quality of its leases and its residual return history will continue to allow it to obtain such financing  no assurances can be given that such financing will be available  at acceptable terms  or at all 
the financing necessary to support the company s leasing activities has principally been provided by non recourse and recourse borrowings 
historically  the company has obtained recourse and non recourse borrowings from banks and finance companies 
the company has formal programs with key corporate capital  inc and fleet business credit corporation 
in addition to these programs  recently the company has regularly funded its leasing activities with wachovia bank and trust  citizens leasing corporation  ge capital corporation  national city bank  hitachi leasing america  and fifth third bank  among others 
these programs require that each transaction is specifically approved and done solely at the lender s discretion 
during the year ended march   the company s lease related non recourse debt portfolio decreased to million 
the decrease is primarily the result of loan paydowns on the debt portfolio through customer lease payments 
non recourse financings are loans whose repayment is the responsibility of a specific customer  although we may make representations and warranties to the lender regarding the specific contract or have ongoing loan servicing obligations 
under a non recourse loan  we borrow from a lender an amount based on the present value of the contractually committed lease payments under the lease at a fixed rate of interest  and the lender secures a lien on the financed assets 
when the lender is fully repaid from the lease payment  the lien is released and all further rental or sale proceeds are ours 
we are not liable for the repayment of non recourse loans unless we breach our representations and warranties in the loan agreements 
the lender assumes the credit risk of each lease  and their only recourse  upon default by the lessee  is against the lessee and the specific equipment under lease 
whenever possible and desirable  the company arranges for equity investment financing which includes selling assets including the residual portions to third parties and financing the equity investment on a non recourse basis 
the company generally retains customer control and operational services  and has minimal residual risk 
the company usually preserves the right to share in remarketing proceeds of the equipment on a subordinated basis after the investor has received an agreed to return on its investment 
through mlc clc  llc  the company had a joint venture agreement that had historically provided the equity investment financing for certain of the company s transactions 
firstar equipment finance company fefco  formerly cargill leasing corporation  is an unaffiliated investor which owns of mlc clc  llc 
fefco s parent company  us bancorp  a bank holding company that is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol usb 
this joint venture arrangement enabled the company to invest in a significantly greater portfolio of business than its limited capital base would otherwise allow 
a significant portion of the company s revenue generated by the sale of leased equipment has historically been attributable to sales to mlc clc  llc 
see results of operations 
fefco has discontinued new lease acquisition transactions effective may we actively sell or finance our equity investment with fleet business credit corporation and ge capital corporation  among others 
the company s accounts payable equipment represents equipment costs that have been placed on a lease schedule  but for which the company has not yet paid 
the balance of unpaid equipment cost can vary depending on vendor terms and the timing of lease originations 
as of march   the company had million of unpaid equipment cost  as compared to million at march  working capital financing in our leasing business was  through december  when it expired  provided by a million committed credit facility which was a short term  secured  recourse facility provided through first union national bank  na and which had syndicated the facility to the following participants and in the following amounts national city bank million  summit bank million  bank leumi usa million  and key bank million 
this credit facility had been in place since december  was previously renewed for a one year period on december   had full recourse to the company  and was secured by a blanket lien against all of the company s assets 
in addition  the company had entered into pledge agreements to pledge the common stock of all wholly owned subsidiaries 
the interest rates charged under the facility were libor plus or prime minus  depending on the term of the borrowing 
the facility expired on december  effective december   the company entered into a million day  committed  secured recourse facility through national city bank 
it had full recourse to the company  and was secured by a blanket lien against all of the company s assets 
in addition  the company entered into pledge agreements to pledge the common stock of all wholly owned subsidiaries 
the credit facility contains certain financial covenants and certain restrictions on  among other things  the company s ability to make certain investments  and sell assets or merge with another company 
the interest rates charged under the facility are libor plus a margin ranging from to or prime plus a margin ranging from to 
the margin was determined by a matrix that was based on a ratio of the company s total recourse funded debt to ebitda earnings before interest  tax  depreciation  and amortization as determined under the facility 
subsequently  on january   the million national city credit facility was amended and increased to million and the term was lengthened to years 
the new facility expires on april  in addition  branch banking and trust company million and pnc bank  na million were added to the facility and national city was appointed agent 
the margin related to the libor interest rate option was increased from to to to 
as of march   the company had an outstanding balance of million on the national city credit facility 
the loss of this relationship could have a material adverse effect on our future results as we rely on this facility for daily working capital and liquidity for our leasing business 
in general  we use this facility to pay the cost of equipment to be put on lease  and we repay borrowings from the proceeds of long term  non recourse  fixed rate financing which we obtain from lenders after the underlying lease transaction is finalized or sales of leases to third parties 
as of march   the outstanding balance on the national city facility amounted to million  and represented of the outstanding recourse debt 
as of march   the outstanding balance on the national city facility amounted to million  and represented of the outstanding recourse debt 
the company has a million subordinated recourse note payable due to centura bank resulting from the acquisition of clg  inc this note comes due in october  and has an interest rate payable monthly 
eplus technology of nc  inc  eplus technology of pa  inc 
and eplus technology  inc 
have separate credit facilities to finance their working capital requirements for inventories and accounts receivable 
their traditional business as sellers of personal computers and related network equipment and software products is financed through agreements known as floor planning financing in which interest expense for the first thirty to forty days is not charged but is paid by the supplier distributor 
the floor planning liabilities are recorded as accounts payable trade  as they are normally repaid within the thirty to forty day time frame and represent an assigned accounts payable originally generated with the supplier distributor 
if the thirty to forty day obligation is not paid timely  interest is then assessed at stated contractual rates 
in addition to the floor planning financing  eplus technology  inc 
and eplus technology of nc  inc 
have accounts receivable facilities through deutsche financial services corporation

the company s e commerce business has an extremely limited operating history 
although it has been in the business of financing and selling information technology equipment since  the company expects to derive a significant portion of its future revenues from its eplussuite services 
as a result  the company will encounter some of the challenges  risks  difficulties and uncertainties frequently encountered by early stage companies using new and unproven business models in new and rapidly evolving markets 
some of these challenges relate to the company s ability to o increase the total number of users of eplussuite services  o adapt to meet changes in its markets and competitive developments  and o continue to update its technology to enhance the features and functionality of its suite of products

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk although a substantial portion of the company s liabilities are non recourse  fixed interest rate instruments  the company is reliant upon lines of credit and other financing facilities which are subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
these instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes  are denominated in us dollars  and  with the exception of amounts drawn under the national city bank and deutsche facilities  bear interest at a fixed rate 
because the interest rate on these instruments is fixed  changes in interest rates will not directly impact our cash flows 
borrowings under the national city and deutsche facilities bear interest at a market based variable rate  based on a rate selected by the company and determined at the time of borrowing 
if the amount borrowed is not paid at the end of the rate period  the rate is reset in accordance with the company s selection and changes in market rates 
due to the relatively short nature of the interest rate periods  we do not expect our operating results or cash flow to be materially affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of march   the aggregate fair value of our recourse borrowings approximated their carrying value
