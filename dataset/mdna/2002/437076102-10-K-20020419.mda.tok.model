adjusted to reflect the first weeks of the week fiscal year in results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report 
fiscal year ended february  compared to january  fiscal year consisted of weeks compared to weeks in fiscal net sales for fiscal increased to billion from billion in fiscal this increase was attributable to  among other things  the new stores opened during fiscal and full year sales from the new stores opened during fiscal approximately million of the increase in sales was attributable to the additional week in fiscal comparable store for store sales were flat in fiscal due to the weak economic environment resulting from certain factors including  but not limited to  low consumer confidence and high unemployment 
gross profit as a percent of sales was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the rate increase was primarily attributable to a lower cost of merchandise resulting from product line reviews  purchasing synergies created by our newly centralized merchandising structure and an increase in the number of tool rental centers from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal we expect to have tool rental centers in approximately stores by the end of fiscal operating expenses as a percent of sales were for fiscal compared to for fiscal selling and store operating expenses as a percent of sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to growth in store occupancy costs resulting from higher depreciation and property taxes due to our investment in new stores  combined with increased energy costs 
also  credit card transaction fees were higher than the prior year due to increased penetration of total credit sales 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in store payroll expense caused by an improvement in labor productivity resulting from initiatives inside the store and new systems enhancements 
store initiatives include our service performance improvement spi initiative which was implemented in every home depot store in fiscal under spi our stores receive and handle inventory at night  allowing our associates to spend more time with customers during peak selling hours 
in addition  our pro program was in of our home depot stores at the end of fiscal  providing dedicated store resources to serve the specific needs of professional customers 
we expect to have our pro initiative in more than stores at the end of fiscal spi and pro have resulted in improved operational efficiency  safety and customer service 
pre opening expenses as a percent of sales were for fiscal and for fiscal we opened new stores in both fiscal and pre opening expenses averaged  per store in fiscal compared to  per store in fiscal the decrease in the average expense per store was primarily due to shorter pre opening periods as we reengineered our store opening process 
general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were for fiscal compared to in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to cost savings associated with the reorganization of certain components of our general and administrative structure  such as the centralization of our merchandising organization  and our focus on expense control in areas such as travel 
interest and investment income as a percent of sales was for both fiscal and interest expense as a percent of sales was for both fiscal and our combined federal and state effective income tax rate decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease in fiscal was attributable to higher tax credits and a lower effective state income tax rate compared to fiscal net earnings as a percent of sales were for fiscal compared to for fiscal  reflecting the increased gross profit rate  which was partially offset by higher store operating expenses  as described above 
diluted earnings per share were for fiscal compared to for fiscal fiscal year ended january  compared to january  net sales for fiscal increased to billion from billion in fiscal this increase was attributable to  among other things  full year sales from the new stores opened during fiscal  a comparable store for store sales increase and new store openings 
gross profit as a percent of sales was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the rate increase was primarily attributable to a lower cost of merchandise resulting from product line reviews  benefits from global sourcing programs and an increase in the number of tool rental centers from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal operating expenses as a percent of sales were for fiscal compared to for fiscal selling and store operating expenses as a percent of sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to higher store selling payroll expenses resulting from market wage pressures and an increase in employee longevity 
in addition  medical costs increased due to higher family enrollment in our medical plans  rising health care costs and higher prescription drug costs 
finally  store occupancy costs  including property taxes  property rent  depreciation and utilities  increased due to new store growth and energy rate increases 
pre opening expenses as a percent of sales were for both fiscal and we opened new stores in fiscal  compared to opening new stores in fiscal pre opening expenses averaged  per store in fiscal compared to  per store in fiscal the higher average expense was primarily due to the opening of more expo design center stores and expansion of home depot stores into certain new markets including international locations  which involved longer pre opening periods and higher training  travel and relocation costs 
general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase was primarily due to investments in internet development and international operations  as well as a full year of payroll and other costs associated with operating four new divisional offices  which opened during the fourth quarter of fiscal interest and investment income as a percent of sales was for both fiscal and interest expense as a percent of sales was for both comparable periods 
our combined federal and state effective income tax rate decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease was attributable to higher tax credits in fiscal compared to fiscal net earnings as a percent of sales were for fiscal compared to for fiscal  reflecting higher selling and store operating expenses as a percent of sales partially offset by a higher gross profit rate as described above 
diluted earnings per share were for fiscal compared to for fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity 
for fiscal  cash provided by operations increased to billion from billion in fiscal the increase was primarily due to significant growth in days payable outstanding from days at the end of fiscal to days at the end of fiscal  a decrease in average inventory per store as of the end of fiscal and increased operating income 
the growth in days payable and decrease in average inventory per store are the result of our efforts to improve our working capital position by extending our payment terms to industry standards and enhancing inventory assortments 
cash used in investing activities  primarily comprised of capital expenditures  was billion in both fiscal and we opened new stores in both fiscal and we own of the stores opened in and lease the remainder 
we plan to open stores in fiscal and expect total capital expenditures to be approximately billion 
cash used in financing activities in fiscal was million compared with cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal the increase in cash used was primarily due to the net effect of repaying million of commercial paper and issuing million of senior notes during fiscal we have a commercial paper program that allows borrowings up to a maximum of billion 
as of february   there were no borrowings outstanding under the program 
in connection with the program  we have a back up credit facility with a consortium of banks for up to million 
the credit facility  which expires in september  contains various restrictive covenants  none of which are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources 
we use capital  operating and other off balance sheet leases to finance about of our real estate 
off balance sheet leases include three leases created under structured financing arrangements to fund the construction of certain stores  office buildings and distribution centers 
two of these lease agreements involve a special purpose entity which meets the criteria established by generally accepted accounting principles and is not owned by or affiliated with the company  its management or officers 
operating and off balance sheet leases are not reflected in our balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our balance sheet in long term debt 
as of the end of fiscal  our debt to equity ratio was 
if the estimated present value of future payments under the operating and other off balance sheet leases were capitalized  our debt to equity ratio would increase to approximately 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of february  amounts in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt  capital leases operating leases   amount of commitment expiration per period commercial commitments total thereafter letters of credit guarantees contractual obligations consist of long term debt comprised primarily of billion of senior notes further discussed in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and future minimum lease payments under capital and operating leases  including off balance sheet leases  used in the normal course of business 
commercial commitments include letters of credit for certain business transactions and guarantees provided under certain off balance sheet leases 
we issue letters of credit for insurance programs  import purchases and construction contracts 
under certain off balance sheet leases for retail locations  office buildings and distribution centers  we have provided residual value guarantees 
the estimated maximum amount of the residual value guarantees at the end of the lease terms is million 
the leases expire at various terms from through with some carrying renewal options through the expiration date of the residual value guarantees in the table above is based on the original lease terms  however  the expiration period will change if the leases are renewed 
as of february   we had billion in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that our current cash position  internally generated funds  funds available from the billion commercial paper program and the ability to obtain alternate sources of financing should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs through the next several fiscal years 
impact of inflation and changing prices although we cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on operations  we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on sales or results of operations 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and that require judgment 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue  net of estimated returns  at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services 
we estimate the liability for sales returns based on the historical return levels 
the methodology used is consistent with other retailers 
we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns 
when we collect payment from customers before ownership of the merchandise has passed or the service has been performed  the amount received is recorded as a deferred revenue liability 
inventory 
our inventory is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market  with approximately valued under the retail method and the remainder under the cost method 
under the retail method  inventory is stated at cost which is determined by applying a cost to retail ratio to the ending retail value of inventory 
as our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions  our inventory methodology approximates the lower of cost or market 
retailers with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost with a large number of transactions frequently use this method 
in addition  we reduce our ending inventory value for estimated losses related to shrink 
this estimate is determined based upon analysis of historical shrink losses and recent shrink trends 
self insurance 
we are self insured for certain losses related to general liability  product liability and workers compensation 
we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure 
our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates  and is reviewed by management and third party actuaries on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available  if actual trends  including the severity or frequency of claims or fluctuations in premiums  differ from our estimates  our financial results could be impacted 
in an attempt to mitigate our risks of workers compensation and general liability claims  we have significantly enhanced our store safety procedures with spi and other safety awareness programs 
use of estimates 
we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and reported amounts of revenue and expenses in preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  which we will adopt on february   goodwill will no longer be amortized and will instead be evaluated for impairment at least annually 
without this change  amortization expense for goodwill in fiscal would have been approximately million 
we have reviewed our goodwill and completed our impairment analysis and  accordingly  have determined that the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which amends accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas retains the fundamental provisions of sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while resolving significant implementation issues 
sfas retains the basic provisions of apb on the presentation of discontinued operations in the income statement  but expands the scope to include all distinguishable components of an entity that will be eliminated from ongoing operations in a disposal transaction 
we plan to adopt sfas on february  and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

changes in laws and regulations  including changes in accounting standards  tax statutes or regulations and environmental and land use regulations  and uncertainties of litigation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risks results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates 
although we have international operating entities  our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition and results 
our objective for holding derivative instruments is to decrease the volatility of earnings and cash flow associated with fluctuations in these rates 
we have financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
these instruments include fixed rate debt and other contractual arrangements 
we issued million of senior notes in fiscal maturing on april  and million of senior notes in fiscal maturing on september  as of february   the market values of the publicly traded and senior notes were approximately million and million  respectively 
we have two interest rate swap agreements  both designed to hedge the market risk associated with interest rate volatility 
we have one agreement in the notional amount of million that swaps fixed rate interest on million of our million senior notes for a variable interest rate equal to libor plus basis points and expires on april  we have another agreement expiring january  in the notional amount of million that swaps a variable interest rate for a fixed rate of  designed to mitigate the interest rate risk related to the portfolio of our proprietary credit card  which is serviced by a third party
