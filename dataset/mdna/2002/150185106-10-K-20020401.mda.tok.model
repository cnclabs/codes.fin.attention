item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the table below presents certain financial data expressed as a percent of total net revenues and selective statistical information for the periods indicated 
for the years ended december  net revenues admissions food  merchandise and games accommodations and other total net revenues costs and expenses operating costs and expenses depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses operating income before non cash and non recurring costs non cash and non recurring costs operating income interest expense provision for taxes net income selective statistical information amusement park attendance in thousands amusement park per capita spending water park attendance in thousands water park per capita spending business overview the partnership generates its revenues primarily from sales of admission to its parks  food  merchandise and games inside its parks  and hotel rooms  food and other attractions outside its parks 
the partnership s principle costs and expenses  which include salaries and wages  advertising  maintenance  operating supplies  utilities and insurance  are relatively fixed and do not vary significantly with attendance 
the fixed nature of these costs makes attendance a key factor in the profitability of each park 
results of operations for include the results of oasis water park and michigan s adventure since their acquisition in late may of results of operations net revenues for the year ended december  were million  a increase over the year ended december  this followed an increase in  when revenues rose to million from million in net revenues for reflect a increase in combined attendance across the eleven properties to million from million in and a increase in out of park revenues  offset somewhat by a decrease in combined in park guest per capita spending 
in park spending was relatively flat in  due to more aggressive promotions offered during the year at several of the parks  as well as the mix of attendance among the parks 
on a same park basis  net revenues decreased between years  on a increase in out of park revenues  a slight increase in combined in park guest per capita spending  and a decrease in combined attendance 
in  the contribution of michigan s adventure  along with a record year at dorney park  offset attendance declines at the partnership s other four parks resulting from the weak economy and the lack of a major new attraction 
much improved weather  together with the very successful debut of talon  contributed to dorney s record performance 
combined attendance at the six amusement parks finished the year at million  up slightly from meanwhile  combined attendance at the partnership s five water parks increased to million guests  in part due to the contribution of oasis water park 
in  attendance increases at cedar point and valleyfair nearly offset an attendance decline at dorney park caused by very poor weather throughout much of the season  and combined attendance at the five amusement parks finished the year at million  almost even with meanwhile  combined attendance at the partnership s four water parks nearly doubled to million  with the two new california water parks accounting for the increase 
combined guest per capita spending in increased 
operating costs and expenses  excluding depreciation  amortization and non cash or non recurring charges  increased to million in from million in and million in  largely due to the inclusion of the daily operations of michigan s adventure and oasis water park in  and the new breakers express hotel and two new california water parks in the consolidated ebitda margin declined to from in and in  largely due to the acquisition of several lower margin operations in recent years 
in connection with the termination of the prior general partner fee and executive compensation systems in  million variable price unit options were granted to senior management 
these options must be marked to market over their vesting period see note 
after depreciation  amortization and an million non cash accounting charge for these unit options  operating income in decreased to million  following a decrease in and a increase in operating results in the current year were significantly impacted by the million non cash charge  and in by million of non recurring costs incurred in eliminating the partnership s previous general partner fee and executive compensation systems 
excluding these charges  operating income decreased from million to million in  principally the result of decreases in attendance at the partnership s two largest parks 
in  operating income  before non recurring costs  increased as the result of increases in guest per capita spending at each of the parks and additional revenues generated by two new california water parks and a new hotel at cedar point 
net income for  after the million  or 
per unit  non cash charge and higher interest expense  decreased to million compared to million in and million in in  interest expense rose due to increased borrowings from recent acquisitions and large unit repurchases under the partnership s unit buy back program 
for  the partnership plans to invest approximately million in capital improvements at its eleven properties  including the addition of a double impulse roller coaster  called wicked twister  and a peanuts themed family ice show at cedar point  and the construction of the foot tall xcelerator roller coaster at knott s berry farm 
the partnership is optimistic that these investments  as well as other improvements at each of the parks  will generate a high level of public interest and acceptance 
however  stable population trends in the parks market areas and uncontrollable factors  such as weather  the economy  and competition for leisure time and spending  preclude management from anticipating significant long term increases in attendance at the parks 
historically  cedar fair has been able to improve its profitability by continuing to make substantial investments in its parks and resort facilities 
this has enabled the partnership to maintain consistently high attendance levels  as well as steady increases in guest per capita spending and revenues from guest accommodations  while carefully controlling operating and administrative expenses 
impact of september  in the weeks that followed the terrorist attacks of september  attendance at the partnership s parks was understandably below normal levels  although the effect on full year results was not significant  with the peak season already concluded at the its seasonal parks and only knott s berry farm open on a daily basis 
security efforts at the parks were immediately increased after september and those measures will continue into the future 
management does not expect the cost of increased security at the parks to be material to the partnership s overall results 
in addition  although the insurance market hardened considerably following september  the partnership was able to renew coverage at adequate levels for  with premium increases kept to a manageable level 
partnership financial condition the partnership ended in sound financial condition in terms of both liquidity and cash flow 
the negative working capital ratio of at december  is the result of the partnership s highly seasonal business and careful management of cash flow 
receivables and inventories are at normally low seasonal levels and credit facilities are in place to fund current liabilities and pre opening expenses as required 
the partnership has no significant off balance sheet financing arrangements 
in  cash generated from operations totaled million and new term loan borrowings totaled million 
the partnership used million for capital expenditures  million for distributions to the general and limited partners  million to repurchase limited partnership units and million to pay down revolving credit borrowings 
distributions in  at the current annual rate of per unit  would total approximately million  higher than the distributions paid in the partnership has million of fixed rate term debt and commitments for another million in place see note  as well as a million revolving credit facility  which is available through november borrowings under the revolving credit facility totaled million as of december   of which million has been converted to fixed rate obligations for a period of years by use of interest rate swap agreements 
credit facilities and cash flow from operations are expected to be adequate to meet seasonal working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and regular quarterly cash distributions
