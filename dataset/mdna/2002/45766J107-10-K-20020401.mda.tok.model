overview insignia solutions plc the company  which commenced operations in  develops  markets and supports software technologies that implement accelerated virtual machine technology for memory constrained smart devices 
in january  the company announced its intention to launch a new product line called the jeode platform  based on the company s embedded virtual machine evm technology 
this followed a strategic review in late of the company s business 
the company also explored new markets that would leverage the company s years of emulation software development experience 
the jeode platform is the company s implementation of sun microsystems  inc s sun java technology tailored for smart devices 
it leverages patent pending intellectual property to provide these resource constrained devices with high performance  fully compatible java applet and application support 
the product became available for sale in march the jeode platform was the principal product line of the company in the company expects that it will continue to rely upon sales of jeode products  plus new products that may be introduced  for the company s revenue in the foreseeable future 
the jeode product line revenue model is based on original equipment manufacturer s oems and channel partners customer transactions 
during  the company began development of a range of products for the mobile handset and wireless carrier industry 
these products build on our position as a virtual machine vm supplier for manufacturers of mobile devices and allow wireless carriers to build valuable incremental services 
these new products will be shipping during before  the company s principal product line in past years was softwindows 
this product enabled microsoft windows windows applications to be run on most apple computer inc apple macintosh computers and many unix workstations 
revenues from this product line grew until  but declined significantly after that date  along with margins 
this was due to a declining demand for apple macintosh products and increased competition 
the company also shipped realpc  a low cost software product that allowed consumers to play games and other applications designed for intel based pcs on their power macintosh computers 
in management took steps to discontinue these product lines  thus allowing the company to focus exclusively on its jeode platform business strategy 
between december and may  the company shipped ntrigue  a windows compatibility client server product that supported multiple x terminals  workstation clients  macintosh computers  pcs  network computers and net pcs from a windows nt based server 
the company disposed of its ntrigue technology in february the company s operations outside of the united states are primarily in the united kingdom  where the majority of the company s research and development operations and its european sales activities are located 
the company distributes its jeode platform through distributors and oem s and distributed its softwindows product through independent distributors 
the company s revenues from customers outside the united states are derived primarily from europe and asia and are generally affected by the same factors as its revenues from customers in the united states 
the operating expenses of the company s operations outside the united states are mostly incurred in europe and relate to its research and development and european sales activities 
such expenses consist primarily of ongoing fixed costs and consequently do not fluctuate in direct proportion to revenues 
the company s revenues and expenses outside the united states can fluctuate from period to period based on movements in currency exchange rates 
historically  movements in currency exchange rates have not had a material effect on the company s revenues 
the company operates with the united states dollar as its functional currency  with a majority of revenues and operating expenses denominated in dollars 
pound sterling exchange rate fluctuations against the dollar can cause united kingdom expenses  which are translated into dollars for financial statement reporting purposes  to vary from period to period 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was recently released by the securities and exchange commission  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by the company 
in addition  financial reporting release no 
was recently released by the sec to require all companies to include a discussion to address  among other things  liquidity  off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
certain of the company s accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  the recoverability of prepaid royalties  and the adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts 
actual amounts could differ from these estimates 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended 
sop requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
at the time of the transaction  the company will assess whether the fee associated with its revenue transactions is fixed and determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
the company assesses whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after the normal payment terms  which are to days from invoice date  the company accounts for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  the company recognizes revenue as the fees become due 
the company assesses collections based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
the company does not request collateral from its customers 
if the company determines that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  the company will defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for all sales  the company uses either a signed license agreement or a binding purchase order primarily for maintenance renewals as evidence of an arrangement 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  undelivered maintenance and support  the company will allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to the company 
this means that the company will defer revenue from the arrangement fee equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair values for the ongoing maintenance and support obligation is based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts 
fair value of services  such as training or consulting  is based upon separate sales by the company of these services to other customers 
the company s arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  acceptance occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
the company recognizes revenue for maintenance services ratably over the contract term 
the company s training and consulting services are billed based on hourly rates  and the company will generally recognize revenue as these services are performed 
however  at the time of entering into a transaction  the company will assess whether or not any services included within the arrangement require the company to perform significant work either to alter the underlying software or to build additional complex interfaces so that the software performs as the customer requests 
if these services are included as part of an arrangement  the company recognizes the entire fee using the percentage of completion method 
the company estimates the percentage of completion based on the company s estimate of the total costs estimated to complete the project as a percentage of the costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and will adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by the company s review of their current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that the company has identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
since the company s accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of accounts receivables and future operating results 
the preparation of financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in its customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s agreements with licensors sometimes require the company to make advance royalty payments and pay royalties based on product sales 
prepaid royalties are capitalized and amortized as cost of sales based on the contractual royalty rate based on actual net product sales 
the company continually evaluates recoverability of prepaid royalties and  if necessary  will charge to cost of sales any amount that the company deems unlikely to be recoverable in the future 
while historically the company has not recorded any unrecoverable prepaid royalties  the company cannot guarantee that future experiences will be within its expectations 
prepaid royalties are classified as current assets based on estimated net product sales within the next year 
revenues year ended december  in thousands license revenues    service revenues   total revenues    the jeode product line was the primary business of the company for and in  the company shipped two principal product lines the jeode platform and softwindows 
revenue from the jeode product line is derived from four main sources the sale of a development license  the sale of annual maintenance and support contract services  prepaid royalties and commercial use royalties based on shipments of products that include jeode technology  and customer funded engineering activities 
the company derived its softwindows revenues from the sale of packaged software products and annual maintenance contracts  along with royalties received from bundling agreements with oems and customer funded engineering activities under oem contracts 
revenues from the sale of development licenses  packaged products and royalties received from oems are classified as license revenue  while revenues from customer funded engineering activities  training  and annual maintenance contracts are classified as service revenue 
in  and  jeode platform revenues accounted for  and  respectively  of total revenues 
the jeode platform became available for sale in the jeode platform is the principal product of the company

all oems less than sales to customers outside the united states  derived mainly from customers in europe and asia  represented approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the company markets jeode to smart device manufacturers in the united states  europe and japan 
movements in currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on total revenues in  or economic conditions in europe and japan  as well as fluctuations in the value of the euro and japanese yen against the us dollar and british pound sterling  could impair the company s revenues and results of operations 
international operations are subject to a number of other special risks 
these risks include foreign government regulation  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries where we do business  longer receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in  or imposition of  regulatory requirements  tariffs  import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions  potentially adverse tax consequences  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and staffing and managing foreign operations  general geopolitical risks  such as political and economic instability  hostilities with neighboring countries and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  and possible recessionary environments in economies outside the united states 
cost of revenues and gross margin year ended december  in thousands  except percentages cost of license revenues    gross margin license revenues cost of service revenues gross margin service revenues total cost of revenues    gross margin total revenues cost of license revenue is mainly comprised of royalties to third parties  along with the costs of documentation  duplication and packaging 
cost of service revenue includes costs associated with customer funded engineering activities and end user support under maintenance contracts 
the company believes that the significant factors affecting the jeode platform gross margin include pricing of the development license  pricing of the unit usage and royalties to third parties such as sun microsystems  inc sun 
in early  the company signed a five year agreement with sun under which sun established the company as an authorized virtual machine provider 
this agreement was amended in the third quarter of under this agreement the company will pay sun a per unit royalty on each jeode platform enabled product shipped by the company s customers 
license gross margins in decreased to from in  due to the prior year including substantial license revenue from one customer at gross margin 
license gross margins in increased to from in due to the introduction of the jeode product line which accounted for of total license revenues in gross margin for service revenue is impacted by the level of and pricing terms of customer funded engineering activities  which can vary from customer to customer  from contract to contract and the level of maintenance contracts sold 
service gross margins in were compared to in the increase is due to jeode customer funded engineering activities and maintenance agreements 
in the company earned little revenue from customer funded engineering activities 
unix maintenance agreement revenue declined in the company discontinued selling softwindows maintenance in late as a result of the softwindows license arrangement with fwb 
the continued support of existing softwindows contracts with no renewal revenue combined with the high cost of providing support under ntrigue maintenance contracts resulted in the company achieving service revenue gross margins of in to the extent that jeode license revenues increase in future periods  service revenue gross margins are expected to increase due to customer funded engineering activities and the required maintenance  and upgrade contracts for each jeode product sale 
operating expenses year ended december  in thousands  except percentages sales and marketing    percentage of total revenues research and development    percentage of total revenues general and administrative    percentage of total revenues restructuring percentage of total revenues sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and promotional expenses  trade shows  personnel and related overhead costs  and salesperson commissions

as a result of the restructuring  the company anticipates cash savings of approximately million in interest income expense  net year ended december  in thousands  except percentages interest income expense  net percentage of total revenues interest income expense  net increased in over from expense of  to income of  this increase was primarily due to larger cash and cash equivalent balances and no debt in the company s cash  cash equivalents and amounts held in escrow decreased from million at december  to million at december  interest income  net  decreased in over due primarily to a one time expense for a  commitment fee for a million line of credit secured in the first quarter of and reduced interest income earned on the company s cash  cash equivalents and amounts held in escrow

most of the remaining revenues and expenses of the company are british pound sterling denominated and consequently the company is exposed to fluctuations in british pound sterling exchange rates 
there can be no assurance that such fluctuations will not have a material effect on the company s results of operations in the future 
to hedge against this currency exposure  the company has  in prior years  entered into foreign currency options and forward exchange contracts for periods and amounts consistent with the amounts and timing of its anticipated british pound sterling denominated operating cash flow requirements 
the company did not enter into any foreign currency option contracts or forward exchange contracts in  or the company has  at times  an investment portfolio of fixed income securities that are classified as available for sale securities 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase

the company has granted extended payment terms from time to time and recognizes these future payments as accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
based upon the company s current forecasts and estimates  the company is targeting its current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with cash generated from on going operations  to be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures through at least march  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy the company s liquidity requirements  the company may seek to sell additional equity or convertible debt securities or to obtain a credit facility 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on the company s operations

if the registration statement the company files with the sec is not declared effective by the deadline  or if the registration statement is suspended beyond the day limit  the company must issue  for payment of the nominal value of per share  to these investors ads for each ads purchased in the private placement 
in addition  the company must issue  for payment of the nominal value of per share  ads for each ads purchased in the private placement for each month thereafter until the registration statement is declared effective by the sec 
if the company issues additional adss under these obligations  the ownership interest of existing shareholders will be substantially diluted 
dilution adjustments in december  the company issued  ordinary shares in ads form at a price of per share through a private placement 
the company received million less offering expenses totaling million 
along with adss  the company also issued to the investors warrants that entitle them to purchase a total of  adss at an exercise price of per ads 
as described below  the exercise price and the number of adss issuable under the warrants were subject to potential adjustment 
under the december private placement  the investors received warrants to purchase three adss for every adss they purchased 
the exercise price of the warrants was set at of the original per ads purchase price  or 
however  the warrants contain anti dilution provisions which decrease this exercise price and increase the number of adss purchasable if the company sells or is deemed to sell any shares at below market price during the term of the warrants  which ends on december  the private placement that closed on november  was a sale which triggered the anti dilution provisions in the warrants  and  as a consequence  the exercise price of the warrants has been decreased from to per ads  and the number of adss purchasable has increased to  the private placement on february  also triggered the anti dilution provisions of the issuance of december  however  the effect of such dilution was less than of the exercise price and consequently such adjustment is deferred until such time as the accumulation of this adjustment and future adjustments exceed at least of the exercise price 
as part of their warrant agreements  the investors may be entitled to cash payments upon the occurrence of certain major transactions  as defined in the warrant agreements  including change of control provisions 
cash payments are determined in a methodology described in the agreement 
such methodology is impacted by market price 
under the december private placement  the investors were entitled to additional warrants to purchase ads s at nominal value per share if the average of the closing bid price of the ads s over the ten days before an adjustment date was less than 
the adjustment dates commenced on march  and occurred on the th of each month through march   inclusive 
the rights for an adjustment date to occur would terminate upon release of at least million of the funds held in escrow by citrix on december  however  not enough of the funds held were released to trigger this termination 
the calculated average bid price of the company s ads s on all the adjustment dates exceeded per share and consequently no adjustment occurred 
the adjustment rights have now expired 
the company obtained a third party valuation to allocate fair value to amounts received from the private placement between the adss and the warrants 
in the amount allocated to mandatorily redeemable warrants totaled million  of which million was allocated to the warrants  and million was allocated to the additional warrants 
of the remaining net proceeds received  million was allocated to mandatorily redeemable capital 
the million of mandatorily redeemable capital was reclassed when the registration statement for the adss and the adss underlying the warrants issued in the december private placement became effective on march   of which million was classified as ordinary shares and million was classified as additional paid in capital 
limitations in the transaction agreements preclude these investors in question from achieving certain levels of beneficial ownership 
the securities purchase agreement  the warrants and the additional warrants contain the restriction that the company may not issue and a selling investor may not purchase  and the warrants and additional warrants may not be exercised for any adss if doing so would cause such investor to beneficially own more than of the total ordinary shares in issue as determined in accordance with section d of the securities exchange act of under the additional warrants  if such investors are prohibited from exercising the additional warrant as a result of the restriction  the selling investor may  at its option and in addition to its other rights under the securities purchase agreement and the warrant  retain the warrant or demand payment  in cash  from the company in an amount calculated by the black scholes formula multiplied by the number of adss for which the additional warrant was exercisable  without regard to any limits on exercise 
the restrictions on the levels of beneficial ownership in these documents do not  however  restrict those investors from exercising the warrants or additional warrants up to those limitations  selling adss to decrease their level of beneficial ownership  and exercising the warrants to receive additional adss 
this could result in additional dilution to the holders of the company s adss and a potential decrease in the price of the adss 
any significant downward pressure on the price of the company s adss as a result of the exercise of the warrants or additional warrants and the sale of material amounts of the company s adss could encourage short sales of the company s adss 
short sales could place further downward pressure on the price of the company s adss

risk factors in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company s business and prospects potential fluctuations in operating results the company s revenues  margins and operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including demand for the company s products  acceptance and demand for java technology in the smart device markets  the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  the mix of and changes in customers to whom the company s products are sold  the mix of product and service revenue received during the quarter  the mix of development license fees and commercial use royalties received  the timing and acceptance of new products and product enhancements by the company or by the company s competitors  changes in pricing  buyouts of commercial use licenses  product life cycles  the level of the company s sales of third party products  variances in costs associated with fixed price contracts  purchasing patterns of customers  competitive conditions in the industry  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  business cycles and economic conditions that affect the markets for the company s products and extraordinary events  such as litigation  including related charges 
although the company s primary functional currency is the united states dollar  a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are incurred by its united kingdom operations and paid in british pound sterling 
the company enters into short term currency option and forward exchange contracts to hedge the short term impact of exchange rate fluctuations on british pound sterling net operating cash flows  but there can be no assurance that such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations in the future 
a relatively high percentage of the company s expenses is fixed over the short term and  as a result  if anticipated revenues in any quarter do not occur or are delayed  expenditure levels could be disproportionately high as a percentage of total revenues and the company s operating results for that quarter would be adversely affected 
it is difficult for the company to predict when  or if  a particular prospect might sign a license agreement 
development license fees may be delayed or reduced as a result of this process 
the company s success depends upon the use of the company s technology by our licensees in their products  which makes it difficult for the company to predict when the company will recognize royalty or revenues from commercial use licenses 
an increasing amount of the company s sales orders involve products and services that yield revenue over multiple quarters or upon completion of performance 
if license agreements entered into during a quarter do not meet the company s revenue recognition criteria  even if it meets or exceeds the company s forecast of aggregate licensing and other contracting activity  it is possible that the company s revenues would not meet expectations 
if sales forecasted from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter  the company is unlikely to be able to generate revenue from alternate sources in time to compensate for the shortfall 
as a result  and due to the relatively large size of some orders  a lost or delayed sale could have a material adverse effect on the company s quarterly operating results 
moreover  to the extent that significant sales occur earlier than expected  operating results for subsequent quarters may be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
the company intends to make a significant investment in its marketing  sales  customer support and research and development infrastructure to support its jeode product line 
the timing of this expansion and the rate at which the jeode platform generates revenue could cause material fluctuations in the company s results of operations 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
although historically the company s business has not been subject to seasonal variations  sales of the company s products in certain international markets  such as europe  are typically slower in the summer months 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that in some future quarters the company s operating results will be below the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s adss would likely be materially adversely affected 
the prices for the company s adss have fluctuated widely in the past 
during the months ended february  the closing price of a share of the company s common stock ranged from a high of to a low of 
under the rules of the nasdaq stock market  the company s stock price must remain above per share for continued quotation of the company s shares on the nasdaq national market 
stock price volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by the company and other high technology companies  often for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has been instituted against the company 
the company may in the future be the target of similar litigation 
regardless of the outcome  securities litigation may result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
factors affecting future operating results there can be no assurance that the company will experience growth in revenues and net income in any particular period when compared to prior periods 
any quarterly or annual shortfall in net revenues and or net income from the levels expected by securities analysts and shareholders would result in a substantial decline in the trading price of the company s shares 
the company s future performance depends upon sales of products within the company s jeode product line 
during the fourth quarter of  revenues related to the services and sales of products in the jeode product line were million  which accounted for of the company s total revenue in such quarter 
the company incurred an operating loss of million in the fourth quarter of the jeode platform may not achieve or sustain market acceptance or provide the desired revenue levels 
at current overhead levels  the company requires revenues of more than million per quarter to achieve an operating profit 
the jeode product line is the company s sole product line and the company expects that it will continue to rely upon sales of jeode products for the majority of the company s revenues in the future 
the company s revenue is dependent upon its ability to license the jeode product to third parties 
licensing the jeode product is a long and complex process  which usually takes up to or months to complete 
before committing to license the product  potential customers must generally consider a wide range of issues including product benefits  infrastructure requirements  and ability to work with existing systems  functionality and reliability 
the process of entering into a development license with a potential customer typically involves lengthy negotiations 
because of the sales cycle  it is difficult for the company to predict when  or if  a particular prospect might sign a license agreement 
development license fees may be delayed or reduced because of this process 
the company s success depends upon the use of the company s technology by the company s licensees in their smart devices 
the company s licensees undertake a lengthy process of developing systems that use the company s technology 
when a licensee enters into a development license with the company  the company often requires the licensee to prepay some future commercial use royalties  typically an amount projected to cover to months of future usage 
until a licensee has sales of its systems incorporating the company s technology  which create sufficient commercial use royalties to surpass any prepayment to the company  the company does not receive any further royalties from that licensee 
the company expects that the period of time between entering into a development license and actually recognizing commercial use royalties to be lengthy and difficult to predict 
in the first quarter of  the company signed a five year agreement with sun microsystems  inc sun under which sun established the company as a sun authorized virtual machine provider 
the agreement also grants the company immediate access to the java compatibility test suite and the java technology source code 
the agreement includes technology sharing and compatibility verification 
in september  the company and sun entered into amendment no 
the amendment to the technology license and distribution agreement the distribution agreement between the two companies 
the amendment requires the company to make non refundable royalty prepayments to sun 
under the agreement  the company will pay sun a per unit royalty on each smart device shipped by the company s customers 
the amendment deletes the former expiration terms and expires on june  with an optional year term renewal on a portion of the sun technology specifically personal and embedded java 
if the agreement with sun terminates or expires without renewal  the company would not be able to market its jeode product line 
any disruption in the company s relationship with sun would likely impair its sales of jeode 
the company at times licenses software development tool products from other companies to distribute with some of its products 
these third parties may not be able to provide competitive products with adequate features and high quality on a timely basis or to provide sales and marketing cooperation 
further  the company s products compete with products produced by some of its licensors 
when these licenses terminate or expire  continued license rights might not be available to the company on reasonable terms 
the company might not be able to obtain similar products to substitute into its tool suites 
through the date of this prospectus  the company has not experienced any major problems with its third party licenses 
the company may need to raise additional funds in the future  and additional financing may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
further  if the company issues additional equity securities  security holders may experience dilution  and the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the company s ordinary shares 
if the company cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  the company may not have sufficient net assets to maintain the listing of its shares on the nasdaq national market 
further  the company may not be able to develop new products or enhance its existing products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
the company believes  based on current forecasts and estimates  its current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with cash generated from on going operations  to be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures through at least march  the company has experienced operating losses in each quarter since the second quarter of to achieve profitability  the company will have to increase its revenue significantly 
the company s ability to increase revenues depends upon the success of its jeode product line 
jeode may not achieve market acceptance 
if the company is unable to create revenues from jeode in the form of development license fees  maintenance and support fees  commercial use royalties and customer funded engineering services  the company s current revenues will be insufficient to sustain its business 
for the fiscal year  and  the company spent  and  respectively  of its total revenues on sales and marketing 
the company expects to continue to incur disproportionately high sales and marketing expenses in the future 
to market jeode effectively  the company must further develop sales channels in the smart device and wireless device market 
the company must continue to incur the expenses for a sales and marketing infrastructure before it recognizes significant revenue from sales of the product 
because customers in the smart device and wireless device market tend to remain with the same vendor over time  the company believes that it must devote significant resources to each potential sale 
if potential customers do not design the company s products into their systems  the resources the company has devoted to the sales prospect would be lost 
if the company fails to achieve and sustain significant increases in its quarterly sales  the company may not be able to continue to increase its investment in these areas 
with increased expenses  the company must significantly increase its revenues if it is to become profitable 
the market for smart devices and wireless devices is fragmented and is characterized by technological change  evolving industry standards and rapid changes in customer requirements 
the company s existing products will become less competitive or obsolete if the company fails to introduce new products or product enhancements that anticipate the features and functionality that customers demand 
the success of the company s new product introductions will depend on the company s ability to accurately anticipate industry trends and changes in technology standards  complete and introduce new product designs and features in a timely manner  continue to enhance its existing product lines  offer the company s products across a spectrum of microprocessor families used in the smart devices and wireless devices market  and respond promptly to customers requirements and preferences 
the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires that the company manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns 
the company has had difficulty managing the transition from older products in the past 
for example  between and  the company transitioned from the softwindows product line to the ntrigue product line and began preparations for its jeode product line 
during this same period the company s yearly revenues dropped from a high of million in to a low of million in the decrease in revenues was partly because the company did not timely introduce new products  which could compensate for the decreasing demand for our softwindows product line 
development delays are commonplace in the software industry 
the company has experienced delays in the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products in the past and it is likely to experience delays in the future 
the company may not be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely basis or at all  competitive products  product enhancements and new products that respond to technological change  changes in customer requirements and emerging industry standards 
the company s jeode product line is targeted for the smart device market 
the market for these products is fragmented and highly competitive 
this market is also rapidly changing and there are many companies creating products that compete or will compete with the company 
as the industry develops  the company expects competition to increase in the future 
this competition may come from existing competitors or other companies that are not yet known about 
if these competitors develop products that are cheaper or provide better performance or functionality than the company s jeode product line  the company s market share will drop 
many of the company s current competitors and potential competitors have greater resources than the company  and the company might not be able to compete successfully against these organizations 
competition could force the company to reduce the prices of its products  which would result in reduced profit margins and could harm the company s ability to provide adequate service to its customers 
further  the company s competitors can increase their promotions or introduce new or enhanced products that hurt the company s market share 
the company obtains revenues from selling development license packages and commercial use licenses for its jeode product line 
competition may cause the company to reduce the price of these licenses  which will reduce the company s revenues 
the market in which the company competes may change so that the company will have to provide alternate licensing arrangements in the future that are less profitable for the company 
reliance on international sales sales from outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of the company s total revenue in  and  respectively  and are expected to increase over time 
the company markets jeode to manufacturers of smart devices and wireless devices in europe and asia  particularly in japan 
economic conditions in asia and europe generally and fluctuations in the value of the japanese yen and the euro against the us dollar and british pound sterling could impair the company s revenue and results of operations 
international operations are subject to a number of other special risks 
these risks include foreign government regulation  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries where the company does business  longer receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in  or imposition of  regulatory requirements  tariffs  import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions  potentially adverse tax consequences  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and staffing and managing foreign operations  general geopolitical risks  such as political and economic instability  hostilities with neighboring countries and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  and possible recessionary environments in economies outside the united states 
risks associated with potential product defects the company s software products  like all software products  may have undetected errors or compatibility problems 
this is particularly true when a product is first introduced or a new version is released 
despite thorough testing  the company s products might be shipped with errors 
if this was to happen  the company s products could be rejected by customers  or there might be costly delays in correcting the problems 
the company s products are increasingly used in systems that interact directly with the general public  such as in transportation and medical systems 
in systems such as these  the failure of our product could cause substantial property damage or personal injury  which would expose the company to product liability claims 
the company s products are used for applications in business systems where the failure of the company s product could be linked to substantial economic loss 
the company s agreements with its customers typically contain provisions designed to limit its exposure to potential product liability and other claims 
it is likely  however  that these provisions are not effective in all circumstances and in all jurisdictions 
the company may not have adequate insurance against product liability risks and renewal of the company s insurance may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
further  the company s errors and omissions insurance may not be adequate to cover claims 
as of the date of this prospectus  the company has not had any product liability claims or recalls against its jeode line of products 
however  a product liability claim or claim for economic loss brought against the company in the future could lead to unexpected large expenses and lost sales 
also  if the company ever had to recall its product due to errors or other problems  it would cost the company a great deal of time  effort and expense 
the company s operations depend on its ability to protect its computer equipment and the information stored in its databases against damage by fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure  unauthorized intrusion and other catastrophic events 
the company believes it has taken prudent measures to reduce the risk of interruption in its operations 
however  these measures might not be sufficient 
as of the date of this prospectus  the company has not experienced any major interruptions in its operations because of a catastrophic event 
reliance on key personnel the company s future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of its key management  product development  sales  marketing and operations personnel 
the company does not have agreements with any of its key personnel that require them to work for the company for a specific term  and the company does not maintain any key person life insurance policies 
the company believes its future success will also depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales  marketing and operations personnel  many of whom are in great demand 
competition for qualified personnel is intense in the san francisco bay area  where the company s united states operations are headquartered  and the company may not be able to attract and retain personnel 
intellectual property rights the company depends on its proprietary technology 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy the company s products or to reverse engineer or obtain and use information that the company considers proprietary 
the company s competitors could independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technologies 
policing unauthorized use of the company s products is difficult  and while the company is unable to determine the extent to which software piracy of its products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
effective protection of intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
the status of united states patent protection in the software industry is not well defined and will evolve as the united states patent and trademark office grants additional patents 
patents have been granted on fundamental technologies in software  and patents may issue that relate to fundamental technologies incorporated into the company s products 
as the number of patents  copyrights  trademarks and other intellectual property rights in our industry increases  products based on our technology may increasingly become the subject of infringement claims 
third parties could assert infringement claims against the company in the future 
infringement claims with or without merit could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  might not be available on terms acceptable to the company 
the company may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of the company s proprietary rights or to establish the validity of its proprietary rights 
litigation to determine the validity of any claims  whether or not the litigation is resolved in the company s favor  could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of its technical and management personnel from productive tasks 
if there is an adverse ruling against the company in any litigation  the company may be required to pay substantial damages  discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses to infringing technology 
the company s failure to develop or license a substitute technology could prevent the company from selling its products 
potential dilution resulting from warrants some security holders  including the selling security holders  have rights to be issued additional adss by the company if the registration statements covering their shares and the shares underlying their warrants are suspended for more than days in any month period by the company 
the company must issue a total of up to  adss if it suspends any of the registration statements covering the shares and the shares underlying the warrants for more than the days 
the company has not suspended registration statements for more than days in any month period in the past 
the purchase price the security holders will pay per additional ads is the nominal value  or per ads  which is the lowest amount these shares can be purchased under english law 
if the company issues additional adss under these obligations  the ownership interest of existing security holders will be diluted 
potential dilution from anti dilution rights the investors who participated in the company s four private placements received warrants which have anti dilution protections 
this means that they are entitled to purchase an additional amount of ordinary shares  in the form of adss  if the company issues ordinary shares at a price below market price 
the anti dilution protections  if triggered  increase the number of shares which the investors may purchase with their warrants 
the exact amount of the increase is not known until the anti dilution protections are actually triggered 
there are two ways the anti dilution protections can be triggered if the company sells its securities in a transaction  such as a private placement financing  for a price that is lower than the ten day average price of its adss before the transaction  or if the warrants issued in the company s four private placements are exercised at a price less than the ten day average price of the company s adss at the time of exercise 
when some of the warrants the company issued in the private placements are exercised  anti dilution protections will likely be triggered 
the amount of the anti dilution adjustment is based on a formula where the lower the price of the company s adss as quoted on the nasdaq stock market  the greater the potential increase in the number of shares issuable to the warrants due to the anti dilution protections 
for example  if the average ten day price of the company s adss drops to  the total number of adss the investors could purchase with their warrants would increase by  assuming all warrants are exercised at the same time 
if the average ten day price of our adss drops to  this increase would be approximately  additional adss 
anti dilution adjustments could accelerate and increase the magnitude of a decline in the quoted share price of the company s adss 
warrant holders have the right to purchase an increasing amount of shares during a decline in the price of our adss 
if the warrant holders exercise their warrants and sell their shares in the open market during this time  downward pressure is added to the price 
this can further increase the anti dilution adjustments for the remaining warrant holders 
short sales of our shares may further the downward pressure on the price of our adss 
anti dilution adjustments and short sales may accelerate and compound a decline in the price of our adss 
shareholders will also be diluted as warrant holders gain the right to purchase an increasingly large number of shares due to their anti dilution protections 
risk of shareholder litigation the prices for the company s adss have fluctuated widely in the past 
during the months ended february   the closing price of a share of our common stock ranged from a high of to a recent low of 
under the rules of the nasdaq stock market  the company s stock price must remain above per share for continued quotation of its shares on the nasdaq national market 
stock price volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by the company and other high technology companies  often for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against the company 
we may in the future be the target of similar litigation 
regardless of the outcome  securities litigation may result in substantial costs and divert management attention and resources
