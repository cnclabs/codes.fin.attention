summit is a real estate operating company that has elected reit status and focuses on the operation  development and acquisition of class a luxury apartment communities located throughout the southeast  midwest and mid atlantic united states  as well as in texas 
we focus our efforts in seven core markets  with particular emphasis on washington  dc  south florida and atlanta  georgia 
our other core markets are dallas and austin  texas and raleigh durham and charlotte  north carolina 
because we focus on these seven core markets  changes in local economic and market conditions in these markets may significantly affect our current operations and future prospects 
we have experienced weakening fundamentals  primarily a decline in demand for apartment homes  in all of our markets during the year and particularly during the last half of this weakness has been due to the downturn in the national economy  as well as declining economic conditions in our core markets  especially atlanta  austin  charlotte and raleigh durham 
local demand for apartment homes has declined due to lower job growth  a primary driver of apartment demand 
although the current political and economic environment is unpredictable  we expect these trends to continue 
historical results of operations our net income is generated primarily from operations of our apartment communities 
the changes in operating results from period to period reflect changes in existing community performance and changes in the number of apartment homes due to development  acquisition and disposition of communities 
where appropriate  comparisons are made on a fully stabilized communities  acquisition communities  stabilized development communities  communities in lease up and disposition communities basis in order to adjust for changes in the number of apartment homes 
we consider a community to be stabilized when it has attained a physical occupancy level of at least 
a community that we have acquired is deemed fully stabilized when we have owned it for one year or more as of the beginning of the year 
we consider a community that we have developed to be fully stabilized when stabilized for the two prior years as of the beginning of the current year 
we consider a community to be a stabilized development community when stabilized as of the beginning of the current year but not the entire two prior years 
a community in lease up is one that has commenced rental operations but was not stabilized as of the beginning of the current year 
a community s average physical occupancy is defined as the number of apartment homes occupied divided by the total number of apartment homes contained in the community  expressed as a percentage 
average physical occupancy has been calculated using the average of the occupancy that existed on sunday during each week of the period 
average monthly rental revenue presented represents the average monthly net rental revenue per occupied apartment home 
our methodology for calculating average physical occupancy and average monthly rental revenue may differ from the methodology used by other apartment companies  and accordingly  may not be comparable to other apartment companies 
results of operations for the years ended december   and income before minority interest of common unitholders in the operating partnership  gain on sale of real estate assets  impairment loss on investments in technology companies and dividends to preferred unitholders in the operating partnership decreased from million in to million in primarily due to an increase of  in general and administrative costs related to severance costs for senior staff reductions and an increase of  in our reserve for pursuit costs for projects we are no longer pursuing  an increase in depreciation expense of million due to the initiation of depreciation on recently developed communities  as well as a full year of depreciation on communities acquired during the second half of  offset by the absence of a full year of depreciation on communities sold during and  and an increase in interest expense of million as a result of increased average indebtedness outstanding  all offset by an increase in property operating income from to of million 
this same measure increased from million in to million in primarily due to increased property operating income at stabilized communities  as well as the addition of property operating income from communities in lease up  partially offset by a decrease in property operating income due to the disposition of communities 
operating performance of our portfolio of communities we evaluate community performance based on growth of property operating income  which is defined as rental and other property revenues less property operating and maintenance expense 
we believe that property operating income is a meaningful measure for an investor s analysis of community performance as it represents the most consistent  comparable operating performance among our communities 
depreciation is a fixed cost not controllable by our property management staff and not all communities are encumbered by financing instruments 
therefore  all property operating and maintenance expense amounts in this management s discussion and analysis section are presented before depreciation  interest and amortization 
property operating income does not include any allocation of corporate overhead 
you should not consider property operating income as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of our financial performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  as a measure of our liquidity 
our calculation of property operating income may differ from the methodology and definition used by other apartment companies  and accordingly  may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures used by other apartment companies

the property revenue growth rate decreased when compared to the prior year growth rate as a result of lower occupancy levels due to the slowing economy and a decline in job growth 
in  we expect the rate of revenue growth to be below the rate seen in due to continued weak job growth and national economic expectations 
we believe our expectation relative to property revenue growth is based on reasonable assumptions as to future economic conditions and the quantity of competitive apartment communities in the markets in which we do business 
however  there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from this assumption  especially due to the unpredictable nature of the current economy 
property operating and maintenance expense increased by from to personnel costs increased from to primarily due to a one time policy change which decreased discounts offered to employees who rent apartment homes at our communities resulting in commensurate increases in those employees salaries 
the decrease in advertising costs from to is primarily the result of a reduction in media advertising and locator fees 
utility costs increased from to as a result of rising gas prices  as well as an increase in vacant utility costs driven by lower occupancy 
real estate tax costs increased as a result of higher assessments for our communities in over  primarily in texas 
other operating expenses increased from to as a result of the cost of internet connectivity projects at our communities during as a percentage of total property revenues  property operating and maintenance expense increased to in from in in  we expect the rate of operating and maintenance expense growth to be below the rate seen in due to reduced pressure on salaries and third party service costs  as well as an internal focus on expense control 
however  there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from this expectation  especially due to the unpredictable nature of the current economy 
rental and other revenue increased from to due to higher rental rates  higher occupancy rates and increased revenue from sources other than rental income such as telephone  cable and water sub meter income

the floating rate as of december  was 
the fair value of the interest rate swap was million as of december  the swap has been designated as a fair value hedge of the underlying fixed rate debt obligation and has been recorded as a reduction of the related debt instrument 
we assume no ineffectiveness as the interest rate swap meets the short cut method conditions required under fas for fair value hedges of debt instruments 
accordingly  no gains or losses were recorded in income relative to our underlying debt and interest rate swap

the acquisition of these two communities added apartment homes to our portfolio at an aggregate purchase price of million 
the acquisitions were financed with the issuance of  common units valued  in the aggregate  at million and the payment of million in cash 
during the year ended december   we sold seven communities comprising  apartment homes for an aggregate sales price of million  resulting in a gain on sale of million 
net proceeds from the seven communities  equaling million  were placed in escrow with a qualified intermediary in accordance with like kind exchange income tax rules and regulations

we acquired no communities during the year ended december  communities being marketed for sale as of december   we had one apartment community  summit breckenridge  located in richmond  virginia  under contract for sale 
summit breckenridge is expected to be sold during the second quarter of the sale of summit breckenridge is subject to customary closing conditions 
the assets of summit breckenridge were recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell  or million  as of december  the property operating income from summit breckenridge represented less than of our property operating income for the year ended december  proceeds from the sale of summit breckenridge are expected to be used to fund future development 
development activity development communities in process as of december  are summarized as follows dollars in thousands total estimated anticipated apartment estimated cost to cost to construction community homes costs date complete completion summit grand parc washington  dc    q summit shiloh ii atlanta  ga    q summit brookwood atlanta  ga    q summit valleybrook philadelphia  pa    q summit roosevelt washington  dc    q summit stockbridge atlanta  ga    q other development and construction costs  totals     consists primarily of land held for development and other pre development costs 
the estimated cost to complete the development communities listed above of million  as well as our commitment to purchase summit brickell for an estimated price ranging from million to million see the section entitled commitments and contingencies below  represent substantially all of our material commitments for capital expenditures as of december  factors affecting the performance of our development communities we are optimistic about the operating prospects of the communities under construction 
as with any development community  there are uncertainties and risks associated with the development of the communities described above 
while we have prepared development budgets and have estimated completion and stabilization target dates based on what we believe are reasonable assumptions in light of current conditions  there can be no assurance that actual costs will not exceed current budgets or that we will not experience construction delays due to the unavailability of materials  weather conditions or other events 
we also may be unable to obtain  or experience delays in obtaining  all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy  and other required governmental permits and authorizations 
other development risks include the possibility of incurring additional costs or liabilities resulting from increased costs for materials or labor or other unexpected costs or defects in construction material  and the possibility that financing may not be available on favorable terms  or at all  to pursue or complete development activities 
similarly  market conditions at the time these communities become available for leasing will affect the rental rates that may be charged and the period of time necessary to achieve stabilization  which could make one or more of the development communities unprofitable or result in achieving stabilization later than currently anticipated 
in addition  we are conducting feasibility and other pre development work for five communities 
we could abandon the development of any one or more of these potential communities in the event that we determine that market conditions do not support development  financing is not available on favorable terms or at all  or we are unable to obtain necessary permits and authorizations  or due to other circumstances which may prevent development 
during  we wrote off pursuit costs associated with several potential communities and increased our reserve for pursuit projects by  in anticipation of abandoning three additional projects 
there can be no assurance that  if we do pursue one or more potential communities  that we will be able to complete construction within the currently estimated development budgets or that construction can be started at the time currently anticipated 
americans with disabilities act and similar laws under the americans with disabilities act  all places of public accommodation are required to meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
we believe that our communities are substantially in compliance with present requirements of the americans with disabilities act as they apply to multifamily dwellings 
a number of additional federal  state and local laws exist or may be imposed which also may require modifications to our communities or regulate certain further renovations with respect to access by disabled persons 
the ultimate amount of the cost of compliance with the americans with disabilities act or related legislation is not currently ascertainable  and while these costs are not expected to have a material effect on us  they could be substantial 
limitations or restrictions on the completion of renovations may limit application of our investment strategy in particular instances or reduce overall returns on our investments 
inflation substantially all of the leases at our communities are for a term of one year or less 
the short term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk of the adverse effect of inflation 
commitments and contingencies on january   the operating partnership entered into a real estate purchase agreement with a third party real estate developer 
under the terms of the agreement  the operating partnership has agreed to purchase upon completion a class a mixed use community  which will be called summit brickell  and is located in miami  florida 
the operating partnership will purchase summit brickell upon the earlier of one year after construction completion or the achievement of occupancy 
the operating partnership may extend this closing obligation for six months after the initial purchase period 
the operating partnership expects to close on the purchase of summit brickell during late or in the final purchase price will be determined based on actual construction costs plus a bonus to the developer based on the capitalized income of the property at the time of purchase 
the purchase price is expected to range from million to million 
the purchase of summit brickell by the operating partnership is subject to customary closing conditions 
the operating partnership has issued a letter of credit in the amount of million  which will serve as a credit enhancement to the developer s construction loan 
in the event that any amount under the letter of credit is drawn upon  the operating partnership shall be treated as having issued a loan to the developer in the amount of such draw 
any such loan will accrue interest at a rate of eighteen percent per annum 
we have employment agreements with two of our former executive officers  both of whom resigned from such executive positions  but who remain as employees and have agreed to provide various services to us from time to time over the next ten years 
each employment agreement requires that we pay to the former officers a base salary aggregating up to million over the period from july  to december  either party can terminate the employment agreements  effective business days after written notice is given 
the full base salary amount due shall be payable through whether or not the agreements are terminated earlier in accordance with their terms 
funds from operations we consider funds from operations ffo to be an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
ffo  as defined by nareit  represents net income loss excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation of real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures  all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with gaap 
funds available for distribution fad is defined as ffo less capital expenditures funded by operations recurring capital expenditures 
our methodology for calculating ffo and fad may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo and fad utilized by other real estate companies  and accordingly  may not be comparable to other real estate companies 
ffo and fad do not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital expenditures or expansion  debt service obligations  property acquisitions  development  dividends and distributions or other commitments and uncertainties 
ffo and fad should not be considered as alternatives to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of our financial performance or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor are they indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions 
we believe ffo and fad are helpful to investors as measures of our performance because  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  they provide investors with an understanding of our ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
funds from operations and funds available for distribution are calculated as follows dollars in thousands net income    extraordinary items management company minority interest of common unitholders in operating partnership    gain on sale of real estate assets    gain on sale of real estate assets joint ventures gain on sale of real estate assets management company adjusted net income    depreciation real estate assets    real estate joint venture   funds from operations    recurring capital expenditures    funds available for distribution    non recurring capital expenditures    cash flow provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    weighted average shares and units outstanding basic    weighted average shares and units outstanding diluted    recurring capital expenditures are expected to be funded from operations and consist primarily of exterior painting  new appliances  vinyl  blinds  tile  wallpaper and carpet 
in contrast  non recurring capital expenditures  such as major improvements  new garages and access gates  are expected to be funded by financing activities and are  therefore  not included in the calculation of fad 
non recurring capital expenditures for the years ended december  and primarily consisted of major renovations and upgrades of apartment homes in the amounts of  in and  in   in and  in for access gates and security fences  million in and million in in other revenue enhancement expenditures  and million in alternative landscaping mulch in item a
