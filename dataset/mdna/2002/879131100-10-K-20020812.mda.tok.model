major actions under the plan included the exit from and consolidation within underutilized facilities  including the write off of assets abandoned in conjunction with this action  the write off and disposal of certain excess service and other inventories  and focused headcount reductions to streamline the cost structure to that of a smaller measurement business and to eliminate duplicative functions within the company s infrastructure

these actions included a net reduction of approximately of the company s worldwide workforce  the exit from certain facilities and the streamlining of product and service offerings 
as of may   the remaining accrued liabilities under the plan totaled million 
critical accounting estimates management has identified the company s critical accounting estimates which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the financial condition and operating results of the company and require difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
significant estimates underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of net sales and expenses include contingent liability reserves  intangible asset valuation  inventory valuation  pension plan assumptions and the assessment of the valuation of deferred income taxes and income tax reserves 
contingent liabilities the company is subject to claims or litigation concerning patent infringement  environmental and employment issues  as well as settlement of liabilities related to prior dispositions of assets 
as a result  liabilities have been established based upon management s best estimate of the ultimate outcome of these contingent liabilities 
as of may   the company has million recorded as contingent liabilities in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
as a result of divestiture activities  the company is subject to certain indemnities and other contingencies due to contractual obligations entered into at the time of these divestitures 
the company reviews the status of its litigation  indemnities and other contingencies on a regular basis 
included in these liabilities is a reserve for contingent liabilities related to the sale of cpid to xerox on january  as of may   the company had million recorded as a reserve for liabilities associated with the sale of cpid  which is included in the million of total contingent liabilities noted above 
the million of reserves primarily relates to liabilities specifically identified as being retained by the company at the time of sale and contingent contractual indemnities 
the company continues to closely monitor the status of the cpid related liabilities based on information received 
the liability will be adjusted as settlements are completed or more information becomes available that will change the likely outcome of the liabilities 
changes to the estimate of liabilities or differences between these estimates and the ultimate amount of settlement will be recorded in discontinued operations in the statement of operations in the period such events occur 
the remaining million of contingent liabilities includes amounts related to environmental  patent infringement and employment issues  as well as settlement of liabilities related to other prior dispositions of assets 
the company closely monitors these liabilities and changes are made as information becomes available 
intangible assets the company adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on accounting for business combinations and goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal year accordingly  the company no longer amortizes goodwill from acquisitions  but continues to amortize other acquisition related intangibles and costs 
as of may   the company has million of goodwill recorded in other long term assets 
in conjunction with the implementation of the new accounting rules for goodwill  the company completed a goodwill impairment analysis as of the beginning of fiscal year  and found no impairment 
as required by the new rules  the company will perform a similar review annually  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that uses estimates of future market share and revenues and costs for the reporting units as well as appropriate discount rates 
the estimates used are consistent with the plans and estimates that the company uses to manage the underlying businesses 
however  if the company fails to deliver new products for these groups  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or if market conditions in the related businesses are unfavorable  revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved  and the company may incur charges for impairment of goodwill 
for non goodwill intangible assets  the company amortizes the cost over the estimated useful life and assesses any impairment by estimating the future cash flow from the associated asset in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
at may   the company had million of non goodwill intangible assets recorded in other long term assets  which includes patents and licenses for certain technology 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flow related to these assets decreases in the future or the useful life is shorter than originally estimated  the company may incur charges to impair these assets 
the impairment is based on the estimated discounted cash flow associated with the asset 
an impairment could result if the underlying technology fails to gain market acceptance  the company fails to deliver new products related to these technology assets  the products fail to gain expected market acceptance or if market conditions in the related businesses are unfavorable 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined based on currently adjusted standard costs  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
the company s inventory includes raw materials  work in process  finished goods and demonstration equipment of million as of may  the company reviews its recorded inventory and estimates a write down for obsolete or slow moving items 
these write downs reduce the inventory value of these obsolete or slow moving items to their net realizable value 
such estimates are difficult to make under current economic conditions 
the write down is based on current and forecasted demand and therefore  if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
in addition  saturation of the used equipment market can negatively impact the net realizable value of the company s demonstration equipment 
if actual market conditions are different than anticipated  cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations may be different than expected in the period in which more information becomes available 
pension plans benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and yet represent obligations that will be settled far in the future and therefore are subject to certain estimates 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by the company 
the accounting standards require that management make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension income and cost for the year 
as of may   the expected long term rate of return on assets was 
the company has analyzed the rate of return on assets used and determined this rate is reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall market 
management will continue to assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption based on relevant market conditions as prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and will make adjustments to the assumption as appropriate 
a decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would result in reduced pension income of million 
pension income is allocated to cost of sales  research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes the company s provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involves a significant amount of management judgment 
the company is subject to taxation from federal  state and international jurisdictions 
the taxes paid to these jurisdictions are subject to audit for which the company has established estimated liabilities 
the company believes that adequate liabilities have been established for any additional tax and interest that may be assessed 
as of may   the company was subject to audits for fiscal years through included in the years subject to audit are the sales of cpid and the video and networking division which were complex transactions from a tax perspective 
the liabilities associated with these years will ultimately be resolved when events occur to resolve the exposure to the company  such as the completion of audits by the taxing jurisdictions 
to the extent these audits or other events result in an adjustment to these accrued estimates  the effect would be recognized in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations in the period of the event 
the company is currently under audit by the irs for the fiscal years ended through the company expects to receive the audit report prior to the end of calendar year and will determine the range of potential actions upon completion of the audit 
judgment is also applied in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as foreign tax credit carryovers will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
as of may   the company had established a valuation allowance against various deferred tax assets 
accordingly  if the company s facts or financial results were to change thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine changes to the amount of the valuation allowance required to be in place on the financial statements in any given period 
the company continually evaluates strategies that could allow the future utilization of its deferred tax assets

risks and uncertainties described below are some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report 
see forward looking statements at the beginning of this item market risk and cyclical downturns in the markets in which tektronix competes tektronix business depends on capital expenditures of manufacturers in a wide range of industries  including the telecommunications  semiconductor  and computer industries 
each of these industries has historically been very cyclical and has experienced periodic downturns  which have had a material adverse impact on the industries demand for equipment  including test and measurement equipment manufactured and marketed by tektronix 
in particular  the telecommunications industry  including but not limited to the optical segment  have experienced a more dramatic decline than other industries 
in addition  the severity and length of the downturn may also affect overall access to capital which could adversely affect the company s customers across many industries 
during periods of reduced and declining demand  tektronix may need to rapidly align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions while at the same time motivating and retaining key employees 
as discussed above in this item  the company s sales and orders have been affected by the current downturn in its markets 
the ultimate severity of this downturn  and how long it will last  is unknown 
no assurance can be given that tektronix net sales and operating results will not be further adversely impacted by the current or any future downturns or slowdowns in the rate of capital investment in these industries 
timely delivery of competitive products tektronix sells its products to customers that participate in rapidly changing high technology markets  which are characterized by short product life cycles 
the company s ability to deliver a timely flow of competitive new products and market acceptance of those products  as well as the ability to increase production or to develop and maintain effective sales channels  is essential to growing the business 
because tektronix sells test and measurement products that enable its customers to develop new technologies  the company must accurately predict the ever evolving needs of those customers and deliver appropriate products and technologies at competitive prices to meet customer demands 
the company s ability to deliver such products could be affected by engineering or other development program delays as well as the availability of parts and supplies from third party providers on a timely basis and at reasonable prices 
failure to deliver competitive products in a timely manner and at a reasonable price could have an adverse effect on the results of operations  financial condition or cash flows of the company 
competition in general  tektronix competes with a number of companies in specialized areas of other test and measurement products and one large broad line measurement products supplier  agilent technologies 
other competitors include acterna corporation  anritsu  lecroy corporation  spirent  yokogawa and many other smaller companies 
competition in the company s business is based primarily on product performance  technology  customer service  product availability and price 
some of the company s competitors may have greater resources to apply to each of these factors and in some cases have built significant reputations with the customer base in each market in which tektronix competes 
the company may face pricing pressures that may have an adverse impact on the company s earnings 
if the company is unable to compete effectively on these and other factors  it could have a material adverse effect on the compan y s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
supplier risks the company s manufacturing operations are dependent on the ability of suppliers to deliver quality components  subassemblies and completed products in time to meet critical manufacturing and distribution schedules 
the company periodically experiences constrained supply of certain component parts in some product lines as a result of strong demand in the industry for those parts 
such constraints  if persistent  may adversely affect operating results until alternate sourcing can be developed 
volatility in the prices of these component parts  an inability to secure enough components at reasonable prices to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities and configurations demanded or  conversely  a temporary oversupply of these parts  could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
in addition  the company uses certain sole sourced components which are integral to a variety of p roducts 
disruption in key sole sourced suppliers could have a significant adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
worldwide economic and market conditions the company maintains operations in four major geographies the americas  including the united states  mexico  canada and south america  europe  including the middle east and africa  the pacific  excluding japan  and japan 
during the last fiscal year  nearly one half of the company s revenues were from international sales 
in addition  some of the company s manufacturing operations and key suppliers are located in foreign countries 
as a result  the business is subject to the worldwide economic and market conditions risks generally associated with doing business globally  such as fluctuating exchange rates  the stability of international monetary conditions  tariff and trade policies  domestic and foreign tax policies  foreign governmental regulations  political unrest  wars and other acts of terrorism and changes in other economic or political conditions 
these factors  among others  could influence the company s ability to sell in global markets  as well as its ability to manufacture products or procure supplies 
a significant downturn in the global economy could adversely affect the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
intellectual property risks as a technology based company  tektronix success depends on developing and protecting its intellectual property 
tektronix relies generally on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and abroad 
electronic equipment as complex as most of the company s products  however  is generally not patentable in its entirety 
tektronix also licenses intellectual property from third parties and relies on those parties to maintain and protect their technology 
the company cannot be certain that actions the company takes to establish and protect proprietary rights will be adequate 
if the company is unable to adequately protect its technology  or if the company is unable to continue to obtain or maintain licenses for protected technology from third parties  it could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
from time to time in the usual course of business  the company receives notices from third parties regarding intellectual property infringement or takes action against others with regard to intellectual property rights 
even where the company is successful in defending or pursuing such claims  the company may incur significant costs 
in the event of a successful claim against the company  tektronix could lose its rights to needed technology or be required to pay license fees for the infringed rights  either of which could have an adverse impact on the company s business 
environmental risks tektronix is subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of its hazardous chemicals used during the company s manufacturing process 
the company has operated and is in the process of closing a licensed hazardous waste management facility at its beaverton  oregon campus 
if tektronix fails to comply with any present and future regulations  the company could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production 
in addition  such regulations could restrict the company s ability to expand its facilities or could require tektronix to acquire costly equipment  or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
sony tektronix corporation acquisition acquisition of sony corporation s interest in sony tektronix corporation is scheduled to be completed at the end of september upon completion of the transaction  the company s ownership of sony tektronix will increase from to  and the company will be exposed to a greater financial impact from sony tektronix operations 
the acquisition could negatively impact the company s results of operations during fiscal year in addition  operation of sony tektronix as a wholly owned business will involve additional risks  including integration costs and risks following the acquisition and the risks of doing business as a foreign owner in japan 
possible volatility of stock price the price of the company s common stock may be subject to wide  rapid fluctuations 
such fluctuations may be due to factors specific to the company  such as changes in operating results or changes in analysts estimates regarding earnings 
fluctuations in the stock price may also be due to factors relating to the telecommunications  semiconductor  and computer industries or to the securities markets in general 
fluctuations in the stock price have often been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stocks are traded 
shareholders should be willing to incur the risk of such fluctuations 
other risk factors other risk factors include but are not limited to changes in the mix of products sold  regulatory and tax legislation  changes in effective tax rates  inventory risks due to changes in market demand or the company s business strategies  potential litigation and claims arising in the normal course of business  credit risk of customers  the fact that a substantial portion of the company s sales are generated from orders received during each quarter and other risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks  including interest rate  equity price and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
the company maintains a short term and long term investment portfolio consisting of fixed rate commercial paper  corporate notes and bonds  asset backed securities and mortgage securities 
the weighted average maturity of the portfolio  excluding mortgage securities  is two years or less 
mortgage securities may have a weighted average life of less than seven years and managed consistent with the lehman mortgage index 
an increase in interest rates would decrease the value of certain of these investments 
however  a adverse change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows as the company holds these assets as available for sale 
at may   the company s debt obligations had fixed interest rates 
in management s opinion  a increase in interest rates would not be material to the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the company is exposed to equity price risk primarily through its marketable equity securities portfolio  including investments in merix corporation and other companies 
the company has not entered into any hedging programs to mitigate equity price risk 
in management s opinion  an adverse change of in the value of these securities would not be material to the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily through transactions and commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
the company utilizes derivative financial instruments  primarily forward foreign currency exchange contracts  generally with maturities of one to three months  to mitigate this risk where natural hedging strategies cannot be employed 
the company s policy is to only enter into derivative transactions when the company has an identifiable exposure to risk  thus not creating additional foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in management s opinion  a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on these instruments and therefore the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows
