item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii of this report 
we may incur losses on our collectibles inventory 
in addition to auctioning collectibles on consignment  we own some of the collectibles sold in our auctions and own almost all of the collectibles that we sell at retail 
we purchase these collectibles from dealers and collectors and assume the inventory and price risks of these items until they are sold 
if we are unable to resell these purchased collectibles when we want or need to  or at prices sufficient to generate a profit on their resale  or if the market value of our inventory of purchased collectibles declines  our revenues and operating results would decline 
see inventory and working capital elsewhere in this item our investment and expansion in new collectibles markets may not generate adequate returns 
we have expanded into new collectibles markets  offering authentication and grading services in the collectible stamp market and authentication services in the autograph sports memorabilia market for the first time 
those services may not find market acceptance by dealers and collectors in those markets as they have in the coin and sportscard markets 
in addition  standards for authenticating and grading stamps and authenticating autographs are not well established  which increases the risks of errors in grading and authentication that could make it difficult to establish the creditability of such services on which the success of those businesses is dependent 
as a result  we may not generate acceptable returns  and we could incur losses on our investments in these new businesses 
other risks associated with expansion of our business 
if appropriate opportunities present themselves  we also intend to acquire businesses  technologies  services or products that we believe will help us to expand our business 
the process of integrating an acquired business  technology  service or product may result in operating difficulties and expenditures which we cannot anticipate and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for further development of our existing business 
moreover  the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may not be realized 
any future acquisitions of other businesses  technologies  services or products might require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing  which might not be available to us on favorable terms or at all  and might be dilutive 
we could suffer losses on authentication and grading warranties 
we offer a warranty covering the coins and sportscards that we authenticate and grade 
under the terms of our warranty  any coin or sportscard that was originally graded by us and which subsequently receives a lower grade upon resubmittal to us for grading  obligates us either to purchase the coin or sportscard or pay the difference in value of the item at its original grade as compared with its lower grade 
we have no insurance coverage for claims made under these warranties and  therefore  we maintain reserves to satisfy such warranty claims based on historical experience  which in the past have proven to be adequate 
if warranty claims were to exceed these reserves  we would incur additional charges that would adversely affect our operating results 
increased competition could affect our financial performance 
our auction and retail businesses are highly competitive 
we compete directly with other auction companies that specialize in and have an industry reputation for hosting premium collectibles auctions  including sotheby s  inc  christie s  inc mastronet and heritage capital corporation 
these competitors each have the ability to attract collectible consignments and buyers to their auctions as a result of their reputation and the quality of the collectibles they are able to obtain through their industry connections and financial resources 
in addition  other reputable auction companies that do not presently engage in auctions for coins or sportscards  or other collectibles that are the focus of our business  may decide to enter our markets to compete with us 
some companies have greater name recognition and have greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
our retail sales business is highly competitive with hundreds of competitors  some of whom are larger and enjoy greater name recognition than our company 
additionally  although there are few major competitors in the collectibles authentication and grading markets  competition also is intense in these markets 
increases in competition could adversely affect our pricing and profit margins and our ability to achieve further growth 
see competition elsewhere in this part i 
the imposition of government regulations could increase the costs of doing business 
the collectible coin and other high end collectibles markets are not currently subject to direct federal  state or local regulation  although auctions in general and the sale of particular types of artwork and autographed sports memorabilia are regulated in some states 
however  from time to time government authorities discuss additional regulations which could impose restrictions on the collectibles industry  such as regulating collectibles as securities or requiring collectibles dealers to meet registration or reporting requirements  and impose restrictions on the conduct of auction businesses 
adoption of laws or regulations of this nature could increase the complexity and costs of conducting auctions  which might decrease our ability to attract sellers and buyers 
factors that could affect our share price performance possible delisting of our shares by nasdaq 
during the quarter ended june   the bid price of our shares declined below per share for a period of consecutive trading days  where it has since remained 
we have been notified by nasdaq that our shares may be delisted from trading on the nasdaq national stock market if the bid price does not increase to at least per share for consecutive trading days within the succeeding days and we are unable to demonstrate to nasdaq that our share price will so increase as a result of actions being taken by the company 
although we believe that anticipated improvements in operating results in the current fiscal year will result in the required improvement in the trading price of our shares  there is no assurance that nasdaq will not proceed with the delisting 
a delisting of our shares from nasdaq would make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares in the open market and for the company to attract new investors and to achieve improvements in the price performance of our stock 
accordingly  if necessary to maintain our nasdaq listing  subject to the approval of our stockholders we are prepared to implement a reverse stock split of our outstanding shares to increase our share price above

services and customers authentication and grading of collectibles 
we offer authentication and grading services for coins and sportscards and have recently inaugurated the grading of stamps 
using proprietary grading software developed by us  our teams of trained and experienced authenticators and graders determine the authenticity of an item submitted and then assign a numeric grade to the item based upon its quality 
after the item is graded  it is usually encapsulated in a tamper evident plastic holder 
customers for our authentication and grading services include individual collectors  dealers and  to a limited extent  wholesalers and manufacturers 
we also offer authentication services for vintage sports autographs and signed sports memorabilia 
after an item of memorabilia is determined to be authentic  it is entered into our database  with a digital picture for future reference  and issued a certificate of authenticity 
customers for our authentication services are primarily individual collectors and dealers 
we also offer authentication services for signed in the presence autographs and sports memorabilia  in which we use our proprietary psa dna authentication system to affix a holographic label and or special ink to the item that marks the item as genuine 
pcgs coin grading operations 
since our inception in  we have graded more than  coins with a declared insured value of more than billion 
we authenticate and grade approximately  coins per year and  depending on the customer s requested turnaround time  we typically charge between and per coin for this service 
we have graded  either before or after sale  three of the five highest priced us coins ever sold at public auction  including an silver dollar that was purchased for approximately  we also have been named as the official grading service of the professional numismatists guild  the most prominent non profit national coin dealer trade organization 
our grading of coins involves a very exacting and standardized process 
we receive coins from dealers and collectors and enter them into our proprietary computerized inventory system which tracks the coins at every stage of the grading process 
the coins are graded by experts with years of coin grading experience who follow our benchmarked grading standards 
coins enter the grading process without any markings that could identify the owner of the coin ensuring that our graders are completely objective 
graders also examine the coins independently from one another 
based upon the type of coin and the results of the grading process  our proprietary software determines whether additional graders will examine the coin to assign a final grade 
the coin is then sonically sealed in our specially designed holder  which also encases the grade  the description of the coin and the pcgs hologram and brand name 
the coin  grade and description are then verified by one or more experts who have the authority to resubmit the coin for further review  if necessary 
only after the grading phase is complete is the coin reunited with its invoice  thus keeping the grading process independent of the identity of the owner and the history of the coin 
psa sportscard grading operations 
our psa division first started grading sportscards in and has graded over million sportscards with a declared value of more than billion 
we employ authentication and grading procedures and provide warranties of accuracy that are similar to the procedures employed and warranties given in authentication and grading of coins 
in addition to baseball cards  we authenticate and grade football  hockey and basketball sportscards and other collectible cards 
we typically charge between and per card for our authentication and grading service  depending on the customer s requested turnaround time 
we also have periodically entered into arrangements with sportcard manufacturers to grade  in bulk  modern sportscards that they produce 
we experienced a rapid increase in grading submissions between fiscal and fiscal however  during the th quarter of fiscal  sportscard submissions started to decline from a quarterly rate of approximately  cards to approximately  cards per quarter  a level at which it has remained throughout fiscal and we believe that this decrease in submission rates is due  in part  to an increase in the number of modern sportscards in circulation  which has led to a reduction in resale prices of those sportscards that has reduced the economic incentive to have them graded 
however  we have been able to partially offset that decline in submissions through our sport card set registry programs 
those programs  introduced by psa in fiscal  have encouraged collectors to collect or amass sets or combinations of related vintage and also modern sportscards  comprised not only of the cards of more famous and popular players  but also of less notable players who may have been or are associated with particular teams or sports events 
to enhance the collectibility and marketability of such related sets or combinations of sportscards  on an increasing basis  dealers and collectors have been submitting the cards making up those sets for grading  including those of the less notable players which might not otherwise have been submitted for grading 
other authentication and grading services 
we commenced stamp authentication and grading and sports autograph authentication during fiscal the volume of submissions through fiscal has not been material  and since these services are new to the markets  we cannot predict when or even whether they will gain market acceptance 
high end collectibles auctions and sales 
we conduct premium auctions for high end collectibles  including coins  currency  sportscards and sports memorabilia  rare records  entertainment and historical memorabilia 
all of our premium auctions offer multi venue bidding that includes varying combinations of internet  telephone  mail and in person formats 
while the number of premium auctions varies each year  we typically conduct approximately premium auctions each fiscal year 
customers for our premium auctions are generally individual collectors and dealers 
at those auctions we sell collectibles that are consigned to us by dealers and collectors consigned collectibles and  to a lesser extent  collectibles that we purchase for resale at our auctions purchased collectibles or owned collectibles 
we also make direct and catalog sales primarily of purchased collectibles 
we generate revenue from our auctions in the form of commissions from both buyers and sellers of consigned collectibles and from sales of purchased collectibles that we sell and buyer s commissions on the sale of purchased or owned collectibles 
commissions from the sale of consigned collectibles vary but are generally between to of the sales price of the collectible 
we charge buyers a commission on the sale of owned collectibles that varies but is generally between and of the sales price 
revenues from the sale of owned collectibles were  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
commissions revenues from the sale of consigned and owned collectibles were  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii of this report 
premium auctions 
premium auctions feature special or unique collectibles that are sold in a multi venue auction formats 
in some of our premium auctions  we utilize callback bidding where bidders can choose to be called back by a phone operator immediately after the close of the first auction phase to be given the opportunity to participate in the final bidding phase 
we require consignors in our premium auctions to ship their collectibles to us prior to auction 
we photograph and prepare descriptions for all items consigned to us for auction and compile and publish a catalog of all items to be auctioned in advance of each of our premium auctions 
collectors can  thus  view all of the collectibles to be auctioned  along with complete descriptions  either by visiting our website and viewing online  or by ordering a catalog in hardcopy format 
at the conclusion of the auction  we handle shipping and payment transactions 
direct and catalog sales 
we also make sales of high end collectibles at fixed prices at our website  at industry shows  by e mail  newsletters  catalogs and by other direct sales programs to customers that prefer purchasing collectibles at fixed prices rather than acquiring them at auctions 
we have a regular database of customers to whom we make direct and catalog sales  which include individual collectors 
publications and content 
we publish authoritative price guides and rarity reports for certain collectibles  including coins  currency and sportscards 
this information is available on our website and in our publications that are distributed throughout the year 
these publications include price guides 
we provide a wide variety of authoritative price guides for a number of collectible markets 
for example  we track the value of the  most actively traded us coins with information dating back to we compile and publish this information in a widely recognized collectible coin index  the cu rarity reports 
three primary characteristics drive the market value of many collectibles relative rarity  grade and significance to collectors 
we compile and publish reports that list the total number of sportscards and coins we have graded since our inception in  categorized by item type and grade determination 
we can publish  for example  the exact number of ms grade s morgan silver dollars we have graded 
collectors can utilize this information to make informed decisions regarding the purchase of particular coins 
articles 
collecting is a passion for many and has nuances and anecdotes that are well suited to a library of articles for each category of collectible 
we write informative articles and publish them on our website 
a sense of community is also important to collectors 
we  therefore  encourage our users to communicate and to write articles that can be made available to all collectors 
historical content 
collecting is often about history  and  in many instances  the collectible s history is what makes it valuable 
in our catalogs  and in other publications  we provide short histories about unusual and rare collectibles that add to the attractiveness and excitement of purchasing such items 
news 
we provide the information that collectors and dealers need to track recent events  trends and developments in the collectibles markets we serve 
for example  new collectibles are constantly being created  some collectibles increase in popularity and other collectibles sell at record prices 
customer support we devote significant resources to providing personalized  customer service and support in a timely manner 
customers can check the status of their grading submissions at our internet website 
in addition  customers or prospective buyers can confirm the authenticity of the over million collectibles we have graded 
customers also can choose to telephone or e mail our general support staff 
we also make available specialists and experts who are able to address virtually any issues our customers may encounter when using our services 
inventory and working capital our inventory consists primarily of collectibles held for sale in our auctions and through direct sales 
in our premium auctions  the majority of the collectibles sold are consigned to us  but we do sell collectibles owned by us  particularly sportscards and entertainment memorabilia 
collectibles sold through direct sales or catalog are usually owned by us 
the supply of high end collectibles is limited  and the timing of their availability in sufficient quantity to support our premium auctions and direct sales is uncertain 
we  therefore  purchase inventory to insure availability and to take advantage of the opportunities to acquire high end collectibles at favorable prices 
in some circumstances  we may purchase a large collection of inventory with the intent of selling it in multiple future auctions 
therefore  our inventories are exposed to potentially limited turnover and valuation risks associated with fluctuations in their market prices 
the company periodically reviews its inventories and takes reserves against potential valuation loss 
historically  fees for authentication and grading were generally prepaid or paid at the time the item was submitted 
prepayments for services are recorded as deferred revenue until the service is completed and the item is returned 
in prior fiscal years  prepaid submittals have provided us with a consistent source of cash and improved our working capital position 
at june   deferred grading revenue  that is  the value of prepaid  but unprocessed grading submissions  was  as compared to  at june  we advance  to certain consignors in our premium auctions  funds in anticipation of selling their collectibles at auction 
we generally charge market rates of interest for such advances and hold their consignment as collateral 
this practice is common in the market for higher end collectibles and is used to attract consignments to our auctions 
at june   we had advanced  to consignors 
the timing of premium auctions can have a significant impact upon our working capital 
we generally pay consignors days after the close of any auction but collect  all  or essentially all  the receivables from an auction days following the completion of the auction 
this auction cycle can cause significant fluctuations in the company s cash balances and working capital position 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii of this report 
manufacturing and suppliers we purchase injection molded parts  holograms and printed labels for our grading services 
there are numerous suppliers for these items  and any one could be substituted without significant delay or cost to the company 
however  while there are numerous sources for injection molded parts  these parts require a die to fabricate the part 
the manufacture of high precision dies can be a lengthy process and requires considerable expertise in their fabrication 
we do not have back up dies for many of our high volume injection molded parts  and we rely on one supplier for these requirements 
in the event that this supplier experiences a protracted production stoppage  we would not be able to service all of our customers 
operations and technology we utilize proprietary software for our authentication  grading  order tracking  order processing and certain database functions 
during fiscal  we completed interfacing our proprietary grading software with a new company wide enterprise software system 
total cost of this new software  and related hardware  was approximately  of which  approximately  and  was expensed during fiscal and  respectively  representing primarily pre development and post implementation training and support costs 
approximately  has been capitalized and is being amortized over a to year life 
competition there are three main competitors in coin grading  numismatic guaranty corporation of america  independent coin grading and anacs  a subsidiary of amos press  inc and a few minor competitors 
in sportscard grading  there are also two main competitors  beckett and sportscard grading corporation  but numerous smaller competitors 
the sportscard grading market attracts new competitors every year and  every year  several competitors disappear from the market 
in july  a new competitor entered the sportscard grading market  scd authentic  a division of krause publications 
we believe that pcgs and psa have the largest market share in each of their respective markets  but barriers to entry into the authentication and grading market are relatively low  especially into the sportscard grading market 
however  the development of a brand name that buyers and sellers will rely on for making sight unseen purchases can take several years to develop  and collectors tend to favor grading services that have an established reputation and whose grading standards tend to support the highest price in the market 
our traditional auction business is also highly competitive 
we compete directly with other companies that specialize in collectibles and have an industry reputation for hosting premium collectibles auctions 
our competitors in traditional auction markets include heritage numismatic auctions  currency auctions of america  recently purchased by heritage  mastro fine sports auctions  greg manning auctions and numerous smaller auction companies that compete in our markets for coins  sportscards and sports memorabilia  currency  rare records  autographs  and other types of collectibles 
in addition  other reputable and much larger auction companies such as sotheby s  christie s and butterfield butterfield  which do not specialize in  but do conduct auctions for collectibles that our company specializes in  are potential competitors 
in addition  other significant auction companies that do not presently engage in auctions for coins or sportscards or other collectibles that are the focus of our business may decide to enter our markets to compete with us 
these companies have greater name recognition than us and have access to more financial and marketing resources than we do 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the traditional auction business are the reputation of the company hosting the auction  the hosting party s ability to attract buyers to the auction and the quality of collectibles available for sale at the auction 
in addition to these traditional auction companies  several companies have developed sales  auctions and trading over the internet 
while these internet e commerce companies generally host auctions or sell collectibles that have lower average selling prices than our collectibles sold at auction  several of them are much larger and have greater financial resources than our company 
these companies include ebay and  to a lessor extent  yahoo and amazon 
in addition  several large companies sell specialty consumer products  including collectibles through interactive electronic media  including broadcast  cable and satellite television and  increasingly  the internet 
these companies include qvc  home shopping network and shop at home 
they generally have substantial financial resources and  while their current collectible offerings tend to be less focused and at lower prices than our collectible offerings  there can be no guarantee that they will not become significant competitors in the future 
direct sales of collectibles is highly competitive 
there are thousands of retail establishments that sell collectibles directly to collectors  and there are numerous catalog companies and e tailers that offer collectibles for sale through the internet 
the company is not dominant in any of these markets  and barriers to entry are relatively low in e commerce using commercially available software 
intellectual property our intellectual property primarily consists of trademarks  copyrights  and proprietary software and trade secrets 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we generally enter into agreements with our employees and consultants and limit access to  and distribution of  our software  documentation and other proprietary information

government regulation numerous states  including the state of california in which our headquarters is located  have regulations regarding the manner in which auctions may be conducted and the liability of auctioneers in conducting such auctions 
we must comply with each state s requirements when conducting in person auctions and are required to collect sales tax depending on the collectible sold and manner in which title changes 
the company conducts multi venue auctions in which the customer may bid  in person  over the telephone or on the internet through our website 
at this time  it has not been determined if a state or governmental body could claim authority over a multi venue auction for purposes of complying with auctioneering laws or the collection of sales tax 
employees as of june   we had full time employees and part time employees 
included in this total were in grading and authentication  in collectible sales and auction  in website development  in sales and marketing and in other business and administrative services 
we have never had a work stoppage  and no employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements

part ii item market for common stock and related stockholder matters the company s common stock has been listed on the nasdaq national market  trading under the symbol clct  since november   when we commenced our initial public offering of common stock 
the following table sets forth high and low closing prices for our common stock  as reported by the nasdaq national market for each of the fiscal quarters in the fiscal years ended on june  and fiscal high low first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fiscal high low first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter the company had holders of record of its common stock and approximately  beneficial owners on june  possible delisting of shares and possible reverse stock split 
during the quarter ended june   the trading prices of our shares declined to less than per share for consecutive trading days 
as a result  we have been informed by nasdaq that our shares may be delisted from trading on the nasdaq stock market  unless we can demonstrate to nasdaq s satisfaction that the decline in our share price is temporary and the price will increase above in the near term 
a delisting of our shares from the nasdaq stock market would result in a decline in the marketability and the liquidity of our shares  making it more difficult for our stockholders to purchase and sell shares when they want or need to do so and for us to achieve improvements in our share price performance 
as a result  if nasdaq determines to proceed with the delisting of our shares  the only alternative available for achieving the increase in our share price required to maintain our nasdaq listing may be a reverse stock split of our outstanding shares  in all probability ranging somewhere between a one share for three share to a one share for five share reverse split 
accordingly  we intend to ask our stockholders  at our annual stockholders meeting scheduled for december   to grant the board of directors the authority to effectuate a reverse split of our outstanding shares within that range 
if the reverse stock split is approved  the board of directors is likely to implement it only if it becomes necessary to ensure the continued listing of our shares on the nasdaq stock market 
accordingly  even if the reverse stock split is approved by the stockholders  the board of directors may elect to delay  or even abandon it entirely if we are able to otherwise maintain the listing of our shares on nasdaq 
dividends and share repurchases we do not intend to declare or pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future  as it is our current policy to retain all earnings to support future growth and expansion 
pursuant to an open market and private stock repurchase program approved by the board of directors  from september   through december   the company purchased  of its shares at an average price of per share 
although we do not currently have plans to do so  depending on market conditions and the alternatives for which the company s cash may be used  the board of directors may consider adopting additional stock repurchase programs in the future

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
in determining the carrying value of some of our assets and liabilities  principally accounts receivable  inventories  warranty obligations  deferred income taxes  and goodwill  we must make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding future events and circumstances that could affect the value of those assets and liabilities  such as future economic conditions that will affect our ability to collect our accounts receivable or sell our inventories in future periods 
those judgments  estimates and assumptions are based on current information available to us at the time they are made 
many of those events and circumstances  however  are outside of our control and if changes in those events or circumstances occur thereafter  gaap may require us to adjust our earlier estimates that are affected by those changes 
any downward adjustments are commonly referred to as write downs of the assets involved 
additionally  decisions of when adjustments of this nature should be made also require subjective judgments involving an assessment or prediction abut the effects and duration of events or changes in circumstances 
for example  it is not easy to predict whether events  such as occurred on september  or increases in interest rates or economic slowdowns  will have short or longer term consequences for a particular business and it is not uncommon for it to take some time  after the occurrence of an event or the onset of changes in economic circumstances  for the full effects of such events or changes to be recognized 
it is our practice in certain cases to establish reserves or allowances to record any downward adjustments or write downs in the carrying value of assets such as these 
examples include reserves or allowances established for uncollectible accounts receivable sometimes referred to as bad debt reserves and reserves for slow moving inventory 
write downs are charged against these reserves or allowances and those reserves are replenished following such write downs  or increased to take account of changed conditions or events  by charges to income or increases in expense in our statement of operations in the periods when those reserves or allowances are replenished or increased 
with respect to other assets  such as goodwill  we write down their carrying value directly in the event of an impairment as a charge to income 
as a result  our judgments  estimates and assumptions about future events can and will affect not only the amounts at which we record these assets on our balance sheet  but also our results of operations 
under gaap  we also must make estimates or judgments regarding the periods during which  and also regarding the amounts at which  sales are recorded 
those estimates and judgments will depend on such factors as the circumstances under which customers may be entitled to return the products or reject or adjust the payment for the services provided to them 
additionally  in the case we grant our customers contractual rights to return products sold to them  we establish a reserve or allowance for product returns by means of a reduction in the amount at which the sales are recorded  based primarily on the nature  extensiveness and duration of those rights and our historical product return experience 
in making our estimates and assumptions we follow gaap and accounting practices applicable to our business that we believe will enable us to make fair and consistent estimates of the realizable or recoverable amounts of those assets and establish adequate reserves or allowances 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are material to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations that are discussed below 
revenue recognition and the allowance for returns 
we record  as deferred revenue  all prepaid grading submissions until the items are graded and returned to the submitter 
upon shipment back to the customer  we record the revenue from grading and deduct this amount from deferred revenue 
for dealers who have open account status  we record revenue at the time of shipment 
we record revenue from the sale of collectibles at our auctions at the time the collectible is either shipped based on agreement with the customer or delivered in person to the successful bidder 
shipment or delivery generally takes place after payment is received from the successful bidder  which can be as long as days after completion of the auction 
as a result  revenues from sales made at auctions conducted in the second half of a fiscal quarter usually will not be recorded until the subsequent quarter 
however  for certain repeat bidders we ship or deliver in person the collectibles at the close of an auction and allow them to pay up to days following the auction 
those sales are also recorded at the time of delivery or shipment 
we also offer extended payment terms to certain collectors or dealers 
for collectibles that we own and sell at auction  we record the successful bidder amount  or hammer  as the sale of the merchandise and record the buyer s fee as commission earned 
we also record the cost of the merchandise sold as cost of revenues 
for collectibles that are consigned to us for auction  we record  as commissions earned  the amounts of the buyer s and seller s fees 
depending upon the type of collectibles auction  we charge successful bidders a to commission and generally charge consignors a to selling commission 
on some large or important consignments  we may negotiate a reduced consignor commission or even pay a fee to the consignor 
we sometimes provide our customers with limited rights to return items sold 
we establish an allowance for estimated returns  which reduces the amounts of our reported revenues  based on historical returns experience 
accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of business  we extend payment terms to larger  more creditworthy collectibles dealers 
we regularly review their accounts and estimate the amount of and establish an allowance for uncollectible amounts in each reporting period 
the amount of that allowance is based on several factors  including the age of unpaid amounts  a review of significant past due accounts  and economic conditions that may affect the ability of dealers to keep their accounts current 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are reviewed each period and  based on that review  and are revised to reflect changed circumstances or conditions and those changes are recorded in the period they become known 
for example  if the financial condition of certain dealers or economic conditions were to deteriorate  adversely affecting the ability of those dealers to make payments on their accounts  increases in the allowance may be required 
since the allowance is created by recording a charge against income that is reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses  an increase in the allowance will cause a decline in our operating results in the period when the increase is recorded 
inventory valuation reserve 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and are reduced by an inventory valuation allowance to provide for declines in the value of our inventory  which consists of collectible coins  sportscards and other collectibles 
the amount of the allowance is determined on the basis of historical experience  estimates concerning future economic conditions and estimates of future sales 
if there is an economic downturn or a decline in sales  causing inventories of some collectibles to accumulate  it may become necessary to increase the allowance 
increases in this allowance will cause a decline in operating results as such increases are effectuated by charges against income 
long lived assets and goodwill 
long lived assets such as property and equipment  and goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
prior to and during the fiscal year ending june   estimated undiscounted future cash flows were used to determine if an asset was impaired and  if such a determination were made  the carrying value of the asset would be reduced to fair value 
any resulting impairment would be recorded as a charge against income in the period in which the impairment was recorded 
however  beginning with our fiscal year  we will be required to assess our goodwill for impairment based on the new standard established by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which will require that assessment to be made on the basis of the fair values of the assets of our reporting units  as defined in sfas no 
 rather than on the basis of undiscounted cash flows 
we are in the process of performing the two step transitional goodwill impairment testing required under this new standard 
although we will not be able to determine the full effect of sfas no 
on our results of operations until we are able to complete that impairment analysis  it now appears that the new standard will require us  in the first half of fiscal  to record a substantial write down in our goodwill  which totaled nearly million at june  the amount of that goodwill write down or impairment will result in a non cash charge that will be recorded on our income statement as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the quarter in which the amount of the write off is determined 
however  we do not expect that it will have an adverse effect our business operations or cash flows

warranty reserve the company offers a warranty covering the coins and sportscards it authenticates and grades 
under the terms of the warranty  any coin or sportscard originally graded by us  which subsequently receives a lower grade upon resubmittal to us  obligates us to either purchase the coin or sportscard or pay the difference in value of the item at its original grade as compared with its lower grade 
similarly  any coin or sportscard originally graded by us  which subsequently is determined to be not authentic  obligates us to purchase the coin or sportscard 
we accrue for estimated warranty costs based on historical trends and related experience 
overview our business 
collectors universe provides grading and authentication services for sportscards  rare coins  vintage stamps and authentication services for autographs and sports memorabilia 
we also sell rare coins and rare currencies  sportscards  sports and entertainment memorabilia and other collectibles through auctions and direct sales channels 
most of our collectibles auctions are conducted utilizing a multi venue format that may include in person  internet  mail in  and telephone bidding options 
this multi venue format allows bidders to enter auction bids at any time and from any place in the manner that is most convenient for them 
we also sell rare coins  sportscards  sports memorabilia and autographs through shows  catalogs  internet and direct sales 
during fiscal year  we conducted weekly internet auctions of consigned and owned collectibles  but these auctions were discontinued at the end of fiscal revenue recognition policies 
we record  as deferred revenue  all prepaid grading submissions until the items are graded and returned to the submitter 
upon shipment back to the customer  we record the revenue from grading and deduct this amount from deferred revenue 
for dealers who have open account status  we record revenue at the time of shipment 
we record revenue from the sale of collectibles at our auctions at the time the collectible is either shipped based on agreement with the customer or delivered in person to the successful bidder 
shipment or delivery generally takes place after payment is received from the successful bidder  which can be as long as days after completion of the auction 
as a result  revenues from sales made at auctions conducted in the second half of a fiscal quarter usually will not be recorded until the subsequent quarter 
however  for certain repeat bidders we ship or deliver in person the collectibles at the close of an auction and allow them to pay up to days following the auction 
those sales are also recorded at the time of delivery or shipment 
we also offer extended payment terms to certain collectors or dealers 
for collectibles that we own and sell at auction  we record the successful bidder amount  or hammer  as the sale of the merchandise and record the buyer s fee as commission earned 
we also record the cost of the merchandise sold as cost of revenues 
for collectibles that are consigned to us for auction  we record  as commissions earned  the amounts of the buyer s and seller s fees 
depending upon the type of collectibles auction  we charge successful bidders a to commission and generally charge consignors a to selling commission 
on some large or important consignments  we may negotiate a reduced consignor commission or even pay a fee to the consignor 
gross profit margins 
the gross margin on sales of consigned collectibles is significantly higher than the gross margin on sales of owned collectibles because we realize commissions on sales of consigned collectibles without having to incur any significant associated costs 
by contrast  upon the sale of owned collectibles  we record the costs of acquiring those collectibles  which are usually a significant percentage of the selling price 
as a result  the sale of owned collectibles reduces our overall auction margins to a level that is significantly below that realized for authentication and grading services 
additionally  to a lesser extent  the gross profit margins on grading submissions can be affected by the mix of submissions between vintage or classic coins and sportscards  on the one hand  and modern coins and sportscards  on the other hand 
generally  our prices for grading services vary depending on the turn around time requested by submitting dealers and collectors  who are willing to pay more for faster turn around of the coins and sportscards they submit for grading 
as a general rule  dealers and collectors request faster turn around for vintage or classic coins and sportscards than they do for modern submissions 
consequently  our gross margin depends  not only upon the mix of grading revenues and auction revenues  but also upon the mix of consigned and owned collectibles sold at our auctions and the mix of vintage and modern collectibles submitted for grading and authentication 
our auctions are held periodically throughout the fiscal year 
the number  scheduling and size of the auctions we conduct vary from quarter to quarter  depending largely on the volume  value and timing of the collectibles consignments that we receive for our auctions 
for this reason  our auction revenue can vary  sometimes significantly  from quarter to quarter 
additionally  under our revenue recognition policies  we do not recognize auction revenues until the items sold at an auction are either shipped based on agreement with the customer or delivered in person to the winning bidders 
since those items generally are not shipped to the winning bidders until payment is received from them  which can take up to days after completion of an auction  revenue generated from auctions conducted near the end of a fiscal period often cannot be reported until the succeeding fiscal period  which contributes to the period to period variability in our auction revenues 
these circumstances also make it difficult to forecast  on a quarterly basis  revenue that will be attributable to our auction business 
our cash flow is also affected by the number and timing of the auctions we conduct 
generally  we pay consignors of collectibles to our auctions the cash price at which their collectibles were sold  less the seller s commissions earned by us  approximately days after completion of the auction 
however  most of the payments for those collectibles from the winning bidders are not received until days after an auction is completed 
as a result  we experience significant cash outflows within the first days  and cash inflows beginning days  following completion of a large auction 
therefore  the amount of cash that we have at the end of any fiscal period can vary widely  depending on the number and timing of the auctions conducted during that fiscal period 
the company generates substantially all of its revenues from the collectibles market segment  which primarily relies on discretionary consumer spending 
during the last quarter of fiscal year  which ended on june   and during fiscal  the company experienced lower revenues from grading submissions  sales of owned collectibles and fees earned on the sale of consigned collectibles 
we believe these lower revenues reflect  at least in part  the impact of recent unfavorable economic conditions on consumer spending 
if these unfavorable economic conditions persist  it is likely that they will adversely affect the company s operating results and financial condition in future periods  as well 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data expressed as a percentage of net revenues fiscal years ended june  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses selling  general administrative impairment of goodwill amortization of goodwill total operating expenses operating income loss interest income  net other  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss net revenues 
net revenues decreased to  in fiscal from  in the prior year 
collectible sales revenues decreased to  in fiscal from  in the prior fiscal year  while grading and authentication revenues declined by to  in the current fiscal year from  in fiscal collectible sales revenue represented and of total revenues  while grading and authentication revenue represented and of total revenues  for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in grading and authentication revenues in fiscal occurred primarily because of a decrease in sportscard submissions 
on the other hand  coin grading submissions increased in fiscal from fiscal however  that increase in coin grading submissions only partially offset the decline in revenues from sportscard grading submissions because the average price for coin grading declined from the prior year 
the reduction in sportscard submissions in fiscal was caused by several factors  including i reduced submissions by sportscard manufacturers for bulk grading  and ii a reduction in resale prices of modern sportscards  which reduced the economic incentive to have these cards graded and sold 
in addition  sportscard grading revenue was negatively impacted by a decline in vintage sportscard submissions  which tend to use a higher priced grading service rate because of the value of these sportscards 
the decline in the average price for coin grading in fiscal was primarily due to a higher proportion of modern coin submittals versus vintage submittals 
grading fees for modern coins are generally lower than grading fees for vintage coins  and this causes the average selling price to decline 
for fiscal  the average grading fee for coins declined approximately 
the decrease in collectibles sales revenues in fiscal was due to several diverse factors  including i a continued decline  which began in fiscal  in the demand for sportscards that we sell at auctions and in our direct sales channels  and ii a reduction in consignments by dealers and collectors to our premium bowers and merena coin auctions and to our lyn knight currency auctions which we believe was primarily due to concerns about the prices that could be realized for their coins and currency due to the economic recession 
net revenues increased to  in fiscal from  in the prior year 
collectible sales revenues increased to  in fiscal from  in the prior fiscal year  while grading and authentication revenues declined by to  in fiscal from  in fiscal collectible sales revenue represented and of total revenues  while grading and authentication revenue represented and of total revenues  for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in grading and authentication revenues in fiscal occurred primarily because of lower sportscard submissions and  to a lesser extent  lower average grading fees for coin grading submissions 
the reduction in sportscard submissions in fiscal was caused by several factors  including i reduced submissions by sportscard manufacturers for bulk grading  ii the absence in fiscal of submissions for grading of pokemon cards  which were very popular in fiscal  and iii a decline in resale prices of modern sportscards  which reduced the economic incentive to have these cards graded and sold 
in addition  sportscard grading revenue was negatively impacted by a decline in vintage sportscard submissions  which tend to use a higher priced grading service rate because of the value of these sportscards 
however  because of the much lower submission rates for bulk grading  which are the lowest cost grading service offered by the company  the average grading fee for sportscard submissions actually increased approximately in fiscal over the prior fiscal year 
the average price for coin grading declined by approximately in fiscal from the prior year primarily because of a higher proportion of modern submittals versus vintage submittals  as overall submission rates were stable 
the increase in collectibles sales revenues in fiscal was due to a variety of factors  including i the fact that operating results in fiscal included a full year of the operations of bowers and merena  which we acquired in march  as compared to only about three months in fiscal  which added approximately  of incremental net revenues in fiscal  ii our acquisitions of james spence autographs and odyssey publications which added approximately  to our net revenues in fiscal  and iii increases in retail and auction sales of owned collectibles in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of revenues from net revenues 
cost of revenues consist primarily of labor to grade and authenticate coins and sportscards  production costs  printing  credit cards fees  warranty expense and the cost of owned collectibles sold in our auctions 
gross profit margin is gross profit stated as a percent of net revenues 
our gross profit margin gross profits as a percentage of revenues declined to in fiscal from in the prior fiscal year 
that decline was due primarily to i the decline in net sales which affected gross profit margins because a significant portion of our costs of sales are fixed and  therefore  cannot be reduced directly in proportion to decreases in our revenues  and ii lower gross profit margins on grading activities because we received a higher proportion of modern sportscards for grading 
as previously discussed  collectors and dealers submitting modern sportscards generally elect lower cost grading services than with respect to vintage sportscards our gross profit margin declined to in fiscal from in the prior fiscal year 
that decline was due primarily to i a change in the mix of revenues to a higher proportion of collectible sales revenue and a lower percentage of grading revenue on which we generally realize higher margins than on sales of collectibles  ii provisions made to establish bad debt and inventory valuation reserves and customer allowances in response to weakening economic conditions  and iii increases in direct labor costs associated with grading operations which were partially offset by lower production and warranty expenses 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a primarily include wages and payroll related expenses  advertising and promotional expenses  travel related expenses  facility and security expenses  outside service charges and other general administrative expenses 
overall  sg a increased in fiscal to  from  the prior fiscal year 
that increase was due primarily to i costs of implementing the company s new enterprise computer management system  including integration of that system with the company s existing grading software  and ii costs associated with changes in management and severance costs resulting from staff reductions that occurred in fiscal as a percentage of total net revenue  sg a expenses increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal  primarily because revenues decreased  while sg a was increasing 
overall  sg a increased in fiscal to  from  the prior fiscal year  due primarily to the inclusion in fiscal of the operating expenses of the acquired businesses and  to a lesser extent  increases in facility rent  salaries and marketing expenses  which were significantly offset by a  reduction in expenses that resulted from the discontinuation of our weekly internet operations 
however  as a percent of total revenue  sg a expenses decreased to in the current fiscal year from in fiscal  primarily because revenues increased at a much greater rate   than did sg a expenses 
goodwill impairment 
periodically  we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and based upon our analysis at june   we determined that the goodwill associated with professional stamp experts pse was partially impaired 
this impairment resulted from a reduction in the projected revenues of pse over the next several years 
accordingly  we incurred a goodwill impairment charge of  in fiscal to reduce the carrying value of the pse goodwill to  during fiscal  we determined that the goodwill associated with our acquisition in of internet universe  llc  which conducted our internet operations  had become impaired 
this determination resulted primarily from a change in our projected revenue for internet advertising on our website www 
collectors 
com  due to industry wide reductions in the viability of banner advertising and the rates that could be charged for this type of internet advertising 
accordingly  we incurred a charge of  in fiscal to reduce the carrying value of the internet universe  llc goodwill to zero 
this impairment charge was reflected in our collectible sales segment for the fiscal year ended june  amortization of goodwill and intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles consists of goodwill charges relating to acquisitions by the company and amortization charges for non competition agreements that we obtained from the sellers in those acquisitions 
we amortize goodwill over periods of to years and non competition agreements over the respective terms of those agreements  which range from to five years 
amortization expense for fiscal was  as compared to  for fiscal this decrease was due to the  goodwill write off in fiscal discussed above  which reduced the amount of goodwill being amortized in fiscal amortization expense for fiscal was  as compared to  for fiscal this increase resulted from the acquisition of bowers and merena and  to a lesser extent  the acquisition of odyssey publications 
those increases were partially offset by a  reduction in amortization expense attributable to the goodwill write off in fiscal  which occurred during the first half of that year 
interest income 
interest income is generated on cash balances that we invest primarily in a highly liquid money market account  short term cds and commercial paper instruments 
interest income was  in fiscal  compared with  in fiscal and  in fiscal the decrease in interest income results primarily from reduced average invested cash balances during as compared to  which declined primarily as a result of operating losses incurred during income taxes 
a tax benefit of  was recorded for fiscal year  reflecting the loss incurred for the year 
for fiscal  the provision for income taxes was  despite a loss from operations before income taxes 
this provision for income taxes resulted from the non deductibility  for income tax purposes  of certain goodwill amortization expenses and other permanent tax differences 
for fiscal  income taxes were provided at  which also reflects the statutory rate of for california c corporations and the non deductibility  for tax purposes  of certain goodwill amortization charges and other permanent tax differences 
for fiscal  we recorded a provision for income taxes of  despite a loss from operations before income taxes  due to the non deductibility  for income tax purposes  of certain goodwill amortization expenses and other permanent tax differences

quarterly results of operations and seasonality the following table presents unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the eight quarters beginning september  and ending on june  the information has been derived from our unaudited quarterly financial statements  which have been prepared by us on a basis consistent with our audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k

these operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any subsequent periods 
we expect our operating results to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors which are outside of our control

because of the variability of the timing  the size and collectible content of our auctions is an inherent feature of our business  we expect that our cash and cash equivalent balances  and outstanding consignor payables  will be subject to significant fluctuations in subsequent reporting periods 
cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal  compared to cash used in operating activities of  in fiscal in fiscal  cash was provided by i a  reduction in accounts receivable caused by enhanced credit management  ii a  reduction in inventories caused by management s emphasis on increasing inventory turns  and iii  of non cash amortization expense charged for the fiscal year 
partially offsetting these cash sources was a net loss for the year of  and an increase in consignment advances against a large auction held in the last few days of june the amount of cash used in operating activities in fiscal  which included  used to pay consignor payables  was largely attributable to the timing of our collectible auctions 
we conducted several large auctions at the end of fiscal  which generated a significant amount of payables due to the consignors whose collectibles were sold at those auctions 
since amounts due collectibles consignors generally are paid days after completion of an auction  those payables were paid in the first quarter of fiscal although the auction activity that generated those payables occurred in fiscal by contrast  the open auctions at june  were not nearly as large as those at june   and accordingly the consignor payable liability significantly decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal net cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal  compared to net cash used of  in fiscal we used  for capital expenditures in fiscal  primarily for computer software and hardware 
we also used net cash of  in the acquisition of collectible properties  inc in april during fiscal  we advanced an officer of the company  in the prior fiscal year  we used  for capital expenditures  primarily related to leasehold improvements for the new corporate offices and net cash of  in the acquisition of odyssey publications 
during fiscal  there was a cash inflow of  from financing activities 
this cash inflow was primarily from the exercise of stock options 
in the prior fiscal year  net cash of  was used in financing activities for the purchase of  shares of our common stock in an open market and private stock repurchase program approved by the board of directors 
we believe that our existing cash balances and internally generated funds  in addition to a million bank line of credit obtained in november  will be sufficient to finance our operations and financing requirements  and we do not expect any material changes in the sources of cash to fund our operations during the next twelve months 
we anticipate that during fiscal  we will be making capital expenditures of less than  borrowings under the million line of credit are subject to certain borrowing base limitations  bear interest at the prime rate at june  plus  and are due on demand 
at september   there were no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit 
our capital requirements during the next twelve months could change as a result of any of a number of factors  including the level of sales that we are able to generate during fiscal  which will depend both on the size of and the value of the collectibles we are able to sell at our auctions  and on grading submission rates and our growth rates 
in addition  as part of our business strategy  we will continue to seek out opportunities to expand our business  both through internal growth and by acquisition  which could require significant cash expenditures 
depending upon these and other factors  we may require additional financing in the future through equity or debt offerings  which may or may not be available or may be dilutive to our shareholders 
our ability to obtain additional capital will depend upon our operating results  financial condition  future business prospects and conditions then prevailing in the relevant capital markets 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective for the first quarter of its fiscal year beginning july  sfas no 
requires that the company record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
the company does not have any derivative instruments nor does the company engage in hedging activities 
therefore  the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on the company s financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires the use of the purchase method of accounting and prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
also requires that the company recognize acquired intangible assets  apart from goodwill  if the acquired intangible assets meet certain criteria 
sfas no 
applies to all business combinations initiated after june  and for purchase business combinations completed on or after july  the company accounted for the acquisition of collectible properties  inc which was consummated subsequent to june   in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that the company identify reporting units for the purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill  reassess the useful lives of other existing recognized intangible assets  and cease amortization of intangible assets with an indefinite useful life 
an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life should be tested for impairment in accordance with the guidance in sfas no 
sfas no 
is required to be applied in fiscal years beginning after december  to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized at that date  regardless of when those assets were initially recognized 
sfas no 
was adopted by the company effective as of july  and will require the company to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test by no later than december  the company is also required to reassess the useful lives of other intangible assets within the first interim quarter after adoption of sfas no 
in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 
 the company did not amortize goodwill arising from the acquisition of collectible properties in fiscal the company s previous business combinations were accounted for using the purchase method 
due to our adoption of sfas no 
 we will no longer amortize our other goodwill balances arising from acquisitions consummated prior to july  such amortization expenses amounted to  in the company is in the process of performing the two step transitional goodwill impairment testing required under the new standard 
based on the analysis for the first step testing performed to date  the company anticipates an impairment of a substantial amount of its goodwill under the new standard in fiscal year the impairment will result in a non cash charge that will be recorded on our income statement as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the fiscal quarter when the amount of that impairment is determined 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supercedes previous guidance on financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets and for segments of a business to be disposed of 
sfas no

to have a significant impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities 
sfas no 
also addresses recognition of certain costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease  costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees  and termination benefits provided to employees that are involuntarily terminated under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  management believes that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial market prices  including interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk and other relevant market rate or price risks 
the company is exposed to a degree of market risk through changes in short term interest rates 
at june   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents 
these funds are primarily invested in a highly liquid money market fund  and interest earned is re invested in the same fund 
the company is exposed to the risk of declining short term interest rates  but we do not consider this risk to be material 
we have no activities that would expose it to foreign currency exchange rate risks or commodity price risks
