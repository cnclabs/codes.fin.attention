during the past two years  approximately of claims have been paid within six months of incurral 
the company revises its estimates for ibnr in future periods based upon continued actuarial analysis of claims payments  receipts and other items subsequent to the incurral period 
revisions to estimates  where material  have been disclosed and are recorded in the period they arise 
the liability is also affected by shared risk arrangements  including arrangements relating to the company s medicare business in certain counties 
in determining the liability for medical costs payable  the company accounts for the financial impact of the transfer of risk for certain medicare members and the experience of risk sharing providers who may be entitled to credits from oxford for favorable experience or subject to deductions for accrued deficits as well as the impact of cost containment arrangements and reserves for estimated settlements 
in the case of the prior north shore medicare risk arrangement discussed below  the company maintains a reserve for a portion of the potential claims liability though the payment obligation has been transferred to north shore for claims incurred prior to january  the company believes that its reserves for medical costs payable are adequate to satisfy its ultimate claim liabilities

the coverage under the new policies is in addition to approximately million of coverage remaining under preexisting primary insurance that is not subject to the retention applicable to the new policies 
the company has fully reserved for anticipated legal expenses for this matter

accordingly  during the third quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million related to a provision for estimated insurance recoveries that may not be recoverable from reliance 
the company  in the opinion of management with the advice of external counsel  has substantial defenses to the plaintiff s claims and may ultimately prevail 
these matters continue toward a trial 
at the present time  no amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
accordingly  the company has not recorded a liability for a potential unfavorable judgment 
in the event the company ultimately suffers a judgment  or settles such actions prior to trial  the company would be liable to fund such judgment or settlement up to the retention  less any remaining available primary directors and officers insurance 
the company has million in insurance over the retention subject to the co pay referred to above and would be uninsured for any liability exceeding these amounts

as a result of the amendment  the company adjusted the amounts included in current and long term liabilities to reflect the scheduled repayments of principal according to the new term loan 
at december   prior to the amendment and based on financial projections at that time for and  the company expected to repay the new term loan in full by june  accordingly  a portion of the debt had been classified as current at december  based on these estimates

under the computer system outsource agreement  csc invoices the company for base operating and capital costs  which covers payments for asset purchases and services  including data center operations and help desk services  among other things 
costs for csc services and equipment utilization fluctuate based on the company s actual usage and are billed by csc at rates established in the agreement

such contracts involve payments to or from the company  generally on a monthly basis  in the ordinary course of business and are not included in the above table 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes a significant amount of assets whose fair values are subject to market risk 
since a substantial portion of the company s investments are in fixed income securities  interest rate fluctuations represent the largest market risk factor affecting the company s consolidated financial position 
interest rates are managed within a tight duration band  generally averaging to years  and credit risk is managed by investing in us government obligations  corporate debt and asset and mortgage backed securities with high average quality ratings and maintaining a diversified sector exposure within the debt securities portfolio 
the company s investment policies are subject to revision based upon market conditions and the company s cash flow and tax strategies  among other factors 
in may  the company adjusted its investment strategy based on projections of future cash flow needs and changes in the interest rate environment 
in order to take advantage of a steepening yield curve  the company extended the duration of the portfolio from an average of years to an average duration between and years resulting in an increased sensitivity to interest rate changes 
in addition to extending the portfolio s duration  the company added mortgage backed and asset backed securities to its list of approved investments in an effort to improve its asset class diversification 
the company continues to require a high credit rating  a or higher  and maintains an average rating of aa on the overall portfolio 
in order to determine the sensitivity of the company s investment portfolio to changes in market risk  valuation estimates were made on each security in the portfolio using a duration model 
duration models measure the expected change in security market prices arising from hypothetical movements in market interest rates 
convexity further adjusts the estimated price change by mathematically correcting the changes in duration as market interest rates shift 
the model used industry standard calculations of security duration and convexity as provided by third party vendors such as bloomberg and yield book 
for certain structured notes  callable corporate notes  and callable agency bonds  the duration calculation utilized an option adjusted approach  which helps to ensure that hypothetical interest rate movements are applied in a consistent way to securities that have embedded call and put features 
the model assumed that changes in interest rates were the result of parallel shifts in the yield curve 
therefore  the same basis point change was applied to all maturities in the portfolio 
the change in valuation was tested using positive and negative adjustments in yield of and basis points 
hypothetical immediate increases of and basis points in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of the company s investments in debt securities as of december  by approximately million and million  respectively compared to million and million as of december   respectively 
hypothetical immediate decreases of and basis points in market interest rates would increase the fair value of the company s investment in debt securities as of december  by approximately million and million  respectively compared to million and million as of december   respectively 
because duration and convexity are estimated rather than known quantities for certain securities  there can be no assurance that the company s portfolio would perform in line with the estimated values 
the year over year variation in the portfolio s sensitivity to changes in interest rates is a function of increased investment balances and an increase in the average duration of the portfolio
