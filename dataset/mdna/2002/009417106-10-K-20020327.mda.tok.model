item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general airnet s consolidated financial statements have been and will be affected by the following factors revenue recognition revenue on express and bank transportation services is recognized when the packages are delivered to their destination 
revenue related to charter services within aviation services is recognized in the period in which services are rendered 
revenue on fixed based operations within aviation services is recognized when the maintenance services are complete or fuel is delivered 
start up costs in april  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop no 
 reporting on the costs of start up activities  which requires that costs related to start up activities be expensed as incurred 
prior to july   airnet capitalized start up costs associated with its premium products line of business 
effective july   airnet ceased capitalizing these costs and began amortizing the previously capitalized costs over five years 
airnet adopted the provisions of the sop in its financial statements as of january  major aircraft maintenance costs of major aircraft inspections  overhauls and engine work are capitalized as incurred and depreciated based on hours flown 
the original costs of airframes are depreciated based on the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the aircraft 
aircraft maintenance costs not meeting airnet s capitalization requirements are expensed as incurred 
the engines of approximately of airnet s learjet aircraft are covered under manufacturer service plans msps  in which airnet prepays certain repair and overhaul costs 
these prepayments  which totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  are classified in fixed assets on the balance sheet 
amortization on these prepaid balances does not begin until services have been performed  at which time the prepaid balances are reclassed into depreciable asset categories and depreciated based on hours flown 
airnet intends to cover all of its lear jet engines under msp plans over the next several years as major overhauls on the non covered engines become due 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  total net revenues were million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of million  or  over the twelve months ended december  net revenues from bank services increased million  or 
this increase was primarily the result of price increases  effective in january  additional volume transported in the days immediately following the september  tragedy  and a increase in weekend weight shipped  offset by one less flying day 
net revenues from express services decreased million  or  from to revenues from charter and anx hazmat increased million in over levels  primarily due to increased shipments of radioactive pharmaceuticals and related medical products 
mercury business services increased revenues slightly over the prior year  primarily due to a increase in shipment volume 
these increases were offset by revenue decreases over levels from a parts fulfillment customer totaling approximately million  primarily in the sdx services area

total costs and expenses were million in  an increase of million  or  over this resulted in income from operations of million in  a decrease of over levels 
wage and benefit expense increased million  or  primarily due to the addition of new pilots and new maintenance technicians over prior year levels  as well as an increase in the payout for the company wide incentive compensation program 
these increases were offset by an decrease in courier personnel 
the decrease in courier personnel is the result of airnet s strategy to better align its ground costs with shipment volumes through the use of vendors and independent contractors 
overall  ground costs were down million  or 
ground courier costs were also down due to the change in the express revenue mix as explained above 
maintenance expense increased million over levels primarily due to additional hours flown in support of the air system and added charter services 
the addition of pilots eliminated a shortage encountered in and allowed airnet to fully staff its nightly routes and staff on demand charter aircraft 
airnet spent million less transporting packages on commercial airlines in primarily due to a change in the express revenue mix  explained above  and less commercial volume during the september  tragedies 
net fuel expense increased million primarily due to increased prices and hours flown

in addition  the board of directors approved a retirement agreement with gerald g 
mercer  founder and former chairman of airnet 
under terms of the agreement  mr 
mercer retired as chairman and a director effective august  a non recurring million charge was recorded in the second quarter to cover wages and benefits associated with this agreement 
in  airnet recognized a non recurring million impairment charge on its investment in the check exchange system company chexs through float control  inc airnet systems  inc 
wholly owns float control  inc  which holds a interest in chexs 
float control accounts for its investment in chexs under the equity method of accounting 
during  chexs received notice that one of its customers  who accounted for a significant portion of chexs revenue  would not renew its contract with chexs beyond august as a result  the million impairment charge on investment was recorded in the second quarter 
this charge included approximately million of goodwill

mercer pursuant to his retirement agreement 
airnet recorded tax expense of million for compared to million for fiscal airnet s effective tax rate for was including the effects of the impairment in the investment in the chexs partnership  which is not expected to have a tax benefit 
excluding the chexs charge  airnet s effective tax rate was  which is the same as net income for the year ended december  totaled million 
income for the year ended december  totaled million before non recurring charges associated with the chexs investment write down and gerald mercer s retirement agreement 
this compared to income of million for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  total net revenues were million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of million  or  over the twelve months ended december  net revenues from bank services increased million  or 
this increase was primarily the result of price increases  effective in january  offset by a reduction in shipment volumes

revenue from charters and anx hazmat services doubled to million in from million in primarily due to increased shipments of radioactive pharmaceuticals and related medical products 
of the express services increase  million can be attributed to increased revenues from mercury business services  approximately million of which can be attributed to rate increases with the remainder the result of a increase in shipment volume 
these increases were offset by volume decreases in the anx and sdx services 
aviation services revenues totaled million for the year ended december  this was a million  or decrease from revenues 
the decrease was primarily due to decreased fuel sales due to higher fuel prices in total costs and expenses were million in  an increase of million  or  over this resulted in income from operations of million in  an increase of over levels 
the increase in operational expenses is partly attributed to increased depreciation expense  which was up million over levels as a result of major engine overhaul additions and aircraft improvements 
maintenance expense was also up million due to increased labor and parts costs 
airnet utilizes outside air providers on certain routes 
costs for these charter services increased million over levels 
net fuel expense decreased slightly as the fuel surcharge programs for both bank services and express services customers offset dramatic price increases experienced during the year 
wage and benefit expense increased million  or  primarily due to the addition of a company wide incentive compensation program implemented in increased wage rates for flight personnel under an enhanced pilot retention plan were offset by a decrease in courier personnel 
the decrease in courier personnel is the result of airnet s strategy to align its ground costs with shipment volumes through the use of vendors and independent contractors 
overall  ground costs were up million  or  primarily due to the addition of the just in time parts customer 
flight training costs increased million with the addition of outsourced flight simulator training and the increase in new trainees related to high pilot turnover 
these costs were offset by decreased workers compensation costs compared to levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses were down million over levels  which contained approximately million in charges for non recurring outside consulting projects and a million bad debt related charge

in addition  the credit agreement requires the maintenance of minimum net worth and cash flow levels  imposes limits on payments of dividends to of net income and restricts the amount of additional debt which may be incurred 
airnet s outstanding balance at december  was million  which is a million increase from the balance at december  investing activities capital expenditures totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million in approximately million was spent on eight new aircraft in substantially all of the remaining expenditures were incurred for aircraft inspections  major engine overhauls  and related flight equipment 
airnet purchased four learjets and three cessna caravans in the fourth quarter airnet anticipates it will spend between million and million in total capital expenditures in and will continue to acquire aircraft and flight equipment as necessary to maintain growth and continue offering quality service to its customers 
in february  airnet began leasing six cessna caravans 
the lease terms range from years to years and contain various cancellation privileges 
airnet will be responsible for general repair and maintenance of the aircraft during the terms of the leases 
under the terms of mr 
mercer s retirement agreement  airnet purchased  common shares from mr 
mercer at a total cost of million 
this privately negotiated transaction closed on july  airnet intends to hold these common shares in treasury 
in addition  at mr 
mercer s option  mr 
mercer may sell up to  of airnet stock each quarter of to airnet based on then current market prices 
mr 
mercer retained his right to sell his remaining airnet common shares to private investors at any time in accordance with applicable laws 
however  airnet has the right of first refusal on purchases of such shares under conditions specified in the agreement 
in february  airnet announced a stock repurchase program allowing airnet to purchase up to million of its common shares 
during  airnet purchased million in common shares 
there was no repurchase activity in the year ended december  under this program 
as such  purchases of approximately million of the company s common shares may still be made over time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
such future purchases would be considered based on current market conditions and the stock price 
airnet anticipates that operating cash and capital expenditure requirements will continue to be funded by cash flow from operations  cash on hand and bank borrowings 
seasonality and variability in quarterly results airnet s operations historically have been somewhat seasonal and somewhat dependent on the number of banking holidays falling during the week 
because financial institutions are currently airnet s principal customers  airnet s air system is scheduled primarily around the needs of financial institution customers 
when financial institutions are closed  there is no need for airnet to operate a full system 
airnet s fiscal quarter ending december is often the most impacted by bank holidays including thanksgiving and christmas recognized by its primary customers 
when these holidays fall on monday through thursday  airnet s revenue and net income are adversely affected 
airnet s annual results fluctuate as well 
operating results are also affected by the weather 
airnet generally experiences higher maintenance costs during its fiscal quarter ending march winter weather often requires additional costs for de icing  hangar rental and other aircraft services 
selected quarterly data unaudited the following is a summary of the unaudited quarterly results of operations for the quarterly periods ended in thousands  except per share data quarters ended  march june september december net revenues     income from operations     net income loss note    net income per share basic and assuming dilution note 

net revenues     income from operations     net income     net income per share basic and assuming dilution 


note includes effects of second quarter non recurring charges totaling million  net of tax  related to million impairment in chexs investment and million charge related to gerald g 
mercer s retirement agreement see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item  respectively 
a million tax benefit was recognized on the mercer agreement and no tax benefit was recognized on the investment impairment 
excluding the effects of the two charges  income for the second quarter totaled million or per diluted share 
inflation historically  inflation has not been a significant factor to airnet 
although the value of airnet s service to its primary customers is enhanced by higher interest rates  the volume of business has not changed historically with fluctuating interest rates 
airnet has attempted to minimize the effects of inflation on its operating results through rate increases and cost controls 
fuel surcharge rebate program airnet maintains a fuel surcharge rebate program for its bank customers 
under this program  as the opis cmh ohio price information service columbus  ohio station price of jet fuel exceeds per gallon  customers are surcharged 
in turn  if the opis cmh price falls below per gallon  the same customers receive a rebate 
for express customers  airnet implemented a temporary fuel surcharge in february airnet increased that surcharge rate to in september  as fuel prices continued to rise 
the surcharge remained in effect in due to the continued high fuel prices 
in  airnet intends to implement a surcharge program for most express service customers similar to that of bank customers 
forward looking statements certain matters discussed in this form k  including information regarding future economic performance and plans and objectives of airnet s management  are forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
when used in this document  the words anticipate  estimate  expect  may  plan  project and similar expressions are intended to be among statements that identify forward looking statements 
such statements involve risks and uncertainties including the following which could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward looking statement potential changes by the federal aviation administration faa  which could increase the regulation of airnet s business  or the federal reserve  which could change the competitive environment of transporting cancelled checks  potential changes in federally and locally mandated security requirements  potential limitations on the availability of adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates in light of the september  tragedies and subsequent events  the impact of a potentially weakening us economy on time critical shipment volumes  the acceptance of the company s time critical transportation service offerings by target markets  adverse weather conditions  technological advances and increases in the use of electronic funds transfers  as well as other economic  competitive and domestic and foreign governmental factors affecting airnet s markets  prices and other facets of its operations 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated 
airnet undertakes no responsibility to update for changes related to these or any other factors that may hereafter occur 
the following factors  in addition to those factors listed above and other possible factors not listed  could affect airnet s actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements 
competition the market for express air and ground delivery service is highly competitive 
airnet s bank services division competes primarily against the federal reserve bank s check relay network  which has significantly greater financial and other resources than airnet 
the federal reserve is regulated by the monetary control act of  which in general requires that the federal reserve price its services on an actual cost basis plus a set percentage private sector market adjustment factor 
failure by the federal reserve to comply with the monetary control act could have an adverse competitive impact on airnet 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the monetary control act will not be amended  modified or repealed  or that new legislation affecting airnet s business will not be enacted 
although major participants in the next day and second day air delivery market such as ups and fedex have also entered the business of sameday and early morning delivery  they have not had a material adverse effect on airnet s business to date 
however  there can be no assurance that these competitors will not have a material adverse effect in the future 
technology some analysts have predicted that the increased use of electronic funds transfers will lead to a checkless society  which could adversely affect the demand for airnet s bank services to the financial services industry 
in addition  some financial services industry analysts have predicted the development of various forms of imaging technology that could reduce or eliminate the need for prompt delivery of cancelled checks see check truncation act below 
similarly  technological advances in the nature of electronic mail and telefax have affected the demand for on call delivery services by express services customers 
while none of these technological advances have had a significant adverse impact on airnet s business to date  there can be no assurances that these or similar technologies  or other regulatory or technological changes in the check clearance and national payment systems  will not have an adverse affect on airnet s business in the future 
check truncation act the check truncation act cta represents an initiative by the federal reserve that would essentially allow for the electronification of the cancelled check and replace the need for expedited transportation services of cancelled checks by most of airnet s banking customers 
the cta has not yet been formalized in a bill and presented to the u 
s 
congress 
however  it is currently being supported by the federal reserve 
airnet believes that several issues surrounding the cta will need to be addressed and resolved prior to passage of such an act by congress 
some of these issues include the current lack of specifications for the quality of check images to be created and used in the clearing process  the failure to establish standardization for information systems platforms  and the failure to address the potentially negative effects the cta could have on consumer s rights 
although the timing for the formal introduction of the cta  or a similar initiative  is currently unknown  the passage of such an act could have a significant adverse affect on airnet s revenues derived from check delivery services 
further  it is unclear when such an electronic clearing system might be implemented by banking customers and how such implementation would affect their expedited check transportation needs 
permits and licensing  regulation airnet s delivery operations are subject to various federal  state and local regulations that in many instances require permits and licenses 
failure by airnet to maintain required permits or licenses  or to comply with the applicable regulations  could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct certain of our operations 
airnet s flight operations are regulated by the faa under part of the federal aviation regulations 
among other things  these regulations govern permissible flight and duty time for aviation flight crews 
the faa is currently contemplating certain changes in flight and duty time guidelines  which  if adopted  could increase airnet s operating costs 
these changes  if adopted  could also require airnet and other operators regulated by the faa to hire additional flight crew personnel 
in addition  congress  from time to time  has considered various means  including excise taxes  to raise revenues directly from the airline industry to pay for air traffic control facilities and personnel 
there can be no assurances that congress will not change the current federal excise tax rate or enact new excise taxes  which could adversely affect airnet s business 
transportation security requirements considerable focus has been placed on package security requirements and processes at domestic and international airports since the september  tragedies and related incidents 
most commercial airlines  fixed based operators where airnet transacts a significant portion of its aircraft loading and unloading operations and airport authorities are in the process of reviewing all aspects of their security requirements 
while many proposed changes are voluntary  many are being mandated by the us department of transportation and the faa 
changes to current security requirements or processes could adversely impact airnet s ability to efficiently conduct its air and ground operations to meet its current delivery parameters  and or could significantly increase airnet s costs to transact such operations if costly new security measures are required 
security aspects being reviewed by commercial airlines that could affect airnet s operations include additional package screening requirements at the time of tender ie potentially requiring additional tender time and potential changes to vendor screening processes that airnet may need to perform on packages from its customers 
many commercial airlines are also adding security surcharges to shipments 
to date  such changes have not had a significant impact on airnet s costs 
changes at fixed base operators and by local airport authorities could potentially limit our ramp access to our aircraft  thereby increasing tender time from customers to airnet 
changes in chain of custody requirements could also potentially cause airnet to incur additional costs to staff additional hours at certain locations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk airnet is exposed to certain market risks from transactions that are entered into during the normal course of business 
airnet s primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk 
at december   airnet had a million outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility 
this facility bears interest at airnet s option of a fixed rate determined by the eurodollar rate  a negotiated rate or a floating rate 
assuming borrowing levels at december   a one hundred basis point change in interest rates would impact net interest expense by approximately  per year 
in  airnet entered into two interest rate swap agreements with a bank as a hedge against the interest rate risk associated with borrowings 
the swap agreements each have a notional amount of million and effectively locked in a portion of airnet s variable rate revolving credit liability at fixed rates of and plus a margin based on airnet s funded debt ratio 
each swap agreement has a three year term 
at december   the aggregate fair value of these interest rate swaps was approximately
