item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this annual report 
we are a self administered  self managed real estate investment trust  or reit  that principally acquires  renovates  develops and manages community and neighborhood shopping centers primarily anchored by supermarkets or other necessity oriented retailers such as drug stores or discount retail stores 
as of december   our portfolio consisted of properties  contained an aggregate of million square feet of gross leasable area  and was occupied based on gross leasable area 
in september  we made two strategic acquisitions which nearly tripled the size of our property portfolio 
on september   we acquired centrefund realty us corporation  or cefus  a wholly owned subsidiary of one of our affiliates  first capital realty inc  an ontario corporation whose shares are traded on the toronto stock exchange tse fcr 
as a result of this transaction  we acquired shopping centers and other retail properties which contained an aggregate of approximately million square feet of gross leasable area and assumed additional indebtedness in the amount of approximately million 
because of the beneficial ownership of approximately of first capital s common stock by gazit globe  ltd  our majority beneficial stockholder  the acquisition of cefus has been accounted for on a push down basis and partially in a manner similar to a pooling of interests 
the push down component of the accounting treatment incorporates gazit globe ltd 
s fair market valuation of the cefus assets and liabilities on august  our results for the period between august   the day that gazit globe acquired its beneficial interest in first capital  and september  have been restated to consolidate our operations with those of cefus subject to a minority interest in cefus 
our results from september   the day we acquired cefus  eliminate this minority interest 
for a more complete discussion of this accounting treatment and the specific impact it has had on our results of operations  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
on september   we completed our acquisition of united investors realty trust  or uirt  a texas real estate investment trust 
as a result of this transaction  we acquired shopping centers which contained an aggregate of approximately million square feet of gross leasable area and assumed additional indebtedness in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
the acquisition of uirt was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the results of uirt are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date we acquired it 
our real estate portfolio has grown substantially during as a result of these acquisitions 
we intend to continue to expand our business by acquiring and developing additional neighborhood and community shopping centers in the near future primarily through a combination of individual property acquisitions  development of new properties  property portfolio purchases and acquisitions of other reits and real estate companies 
results of operations we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases on each of our properties 
these revenues include fixed rents  recoveries of expenses that we have incurred and which we pass through to the individual tenants and percentage rents that are based on specified percentages of tenants revenues  in each case as provided in the particular leases 
our primary cash expenses consist of our property operating expenses  which include real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance  payroll  insurance  utilities and other expenses  general and administrative expenses  which include payroll  office expenses  professional fees and other administrative expenses  and interest expense  primarily on mortgage indebtedness 
in addition  we incur substantial non cash charges for depreciation and amortization on our properties 
we also capitalize certain expenses  such as taxes and interest  incurred in respect of property under development or redevelopment until the property is ready for its intended use 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues of million resulting from the consolidation of the results of cefus for the entire year of compared to the period from august  to december  for the prior year and an additional million of revenues from the acquisition of uirt in september in addition  revenues increased by million for the year ended december  compared to as a result of our acquisition of two shopping centers and the completion of development projects in and the latter part of same property revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a result of higher rental rates and the completion of additions to some of our properties 
finally  investment revenue increased by  and management fees  consisting primarily of real estate services provided to third parties  increased by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  property operating expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in property operating expenses was primarily the result of million of increased operating expenses from the consolidation of cefus for the entire year compared to the shorter period in and million of operating expenses for uirt from its acquisition date 
in addition  property operating expenses increased by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a result of our acquisition of two shopping centers and the completion of development projects in and the latter part of same property operating expenses increased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a result of higher operating costs and the completion of additions to some of our properties 
finally  property management expenses increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a result of managing a substantially larger portfolio of properties  of which million was due to an increase in employee salaries and benefits 
rental property depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from depreciation and amortization expenses attributable to cefus and uirt in the amounts of million and  respectively  and  attributable to our acquisition of new properties and completion of new development projects 
interest and amortizatiion of deferred financing fees increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was primarily due to interest of million and million on indebtedness assumed in connection with the acquisitions of cefus and uirt  respectively 
in addition  interest expense increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as a result of increased mortgage interest of million from the assumption of two loans  the closing of two new loans and interest on convertible partnership units of  and decreased capitalized interest expense of  these increased interest expenses were partially offset by a reduction of  due to decreased borrowing under our credit facility with city national bank of florida 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the product of our growth 
included in these expenses  compensation expenses increased by  directors fees increased by  professional fees increased by  general and administrative costs increased by  related to inclusion of cefus for a full twelve months  and all other costs increased  minority interest in cefus increased by million to million for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase was a result of the consolidation of cefus for the period from january to september   subject to a minority interest as described above  compared to the shorter period in in addition  we recorded extraordinary item expense of million for the year ended december  as a result of the payment of a prepayment penalty in connection with the prepayment of a loan secured by one of our properties 
the increase in equity in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries of  for the year ended december  relates primarily to our interest in the three joint ventures acquired in the cefus acquisition and is attributable to the inclusion of cefus s results for the full year in  as well as commencement of operations at these properties upon completion of development 
as a result of the foregoing  net income increased by million  or  to for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in rental revenues of million resulting from the consolidation of the operations of cefus for the period from august to december  in addition  revenues increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a result of our acquisition of six properties and the completion of certain development projects 
same property revenues  including a termination fee of million  increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a result of higher rental rates and completion of additions to some of our properties 
finally  investment revenue increased by million  most of which can be attributed to the acquisition of cefus  and management fees increased by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  these increases were partially offset by a reduction of rental revenue in the amount of million due to the sale of one of our properties during property operating expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in property operating expenses was primarily the result of million of increased operating expenses resulting from the acquisition of cefus for the period from august to december  in addition  property operating expenses increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as a result of our acquisition of six properties and the completion of certain development projects 
same property operating expenses increased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a result of higher operating costs and completion of additions to some of our properties  partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses of  due to sale of one of our properties during rental property depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from depreciation and amortization expenses attributable to the acquisition of cefus in the amount of million and our acquisition of new properties and completion of new development projects in the amount of  interest and amoritzation of financing fees increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was primarily due to interest of million attributed to indebtedness assumed in connection with the acquisition of cefus 
in addition  mortgage interest increased by approximately million primarily due to a net increase in mortgage loans during of million relating to the acquisition of new properties  the completion of phase one and phase two of the shops at skylake  and the september assumption of the pine island mortgage of million offset by mortgage amortization and certain mortgage repayments  an increase in interest payable with respect to our line of credit of approximately  and an increase in capitalized interest of  which reduced interest expense 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the product of increases in compensation costs of  directors fees of  and general and administrative costs related to the acquisition of cefus of  all other costs decreased by  as a result of the foregoing  net income decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we anticipate that cash generated from operating activities will provide the necessary funds on a short term basis for our operating expenses  interest expense and scheduled principal and interest payments on outstanding indebtedness  recurring capital expenditures necessary to properly maintain the shopping centers and distributions to stockholders 
during  we generated cash from operations of million  reflecting our net income of million plus non cash deductions to income  the most significant of which were depreciation and amortization of million  minority interest in cefus of million and a loss on the sale of real estate of  in addition  operating cash benefited from  among other items  a million reduction in restricted cash resulting from the release of the escrow on our loan related to our skylake property  a million reduction in accounts and other receivables  million decrease in notes receivable resulting from repayments  a million reduction in prepaid and other assets  partially offset by an increase in deposits of million and a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
we used million of cash in investing activities  reflecting million used for additions to property and million of cash used in the acquisition of uirt 
these uses were partially offset by sales of rental property of million and million from the sale of joint venture interests  among other items 
we generated million in cash from financing activities primarily reflecting approximately million in borrowings in excess of mortgage note repayments  million from the sale of common stock net of stock issuance costs and the payment of million in cash dividends to stockholders 
for we incurred cash payments for interest  net of capitalized interest  of million 
capitalized interest  which includes interest for development properties and interest incurred to finance additions and renovations until operational  amounted to million 
moreover  we expect to meet long term liquidity requirements for maturing debt  non recurring capital expenditures and acquisition  renovation and development of shopping centers from excess cash generated from operating activities  working capital reserves  additional borrowings under our existing credit facilities  long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities raised in the private or public markets 
our total mortgage notes payable at december  and consisted of the following in thousands mortgage notes payable fixed rate mortgage loans   variable rate mortgage loans   total notes payable   each of these loans is secured by a mortgage on one or more of certain of our properties 
as of december   the percentage of the total real estate cost of our properties that was encumbered by debt was 
for a more complete description of our mortgage indebtedness  see mortgage indebtedness below 
certain of the mortgages on our properties involving an aggregate principal amount of approximately million contain prohibitions on transfers of ownership which may have been violated by our previous issuances of common stock or in connection with past acquisitions and may be violated by transactions involving our capital stock in the future 
if a violation were established  it could serve as a basis for a lender to accelerate amounts due under the affected mortgage 
we are in the process of obtaining the necessary consents from the lenders 
based on discussions with various lenders  current credit market conditions and other factors  we believe that such consents will be obtained or that the mortgages would not be accelerated 
accordingly  we believe that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
as of december   we had a million credit agreement secured by six properties with city national bank of florida  of which million was outstanding on that date 
this facility accrues interest at over the thirty day libor rate  payable monthly  adjusted every six months  and matures on may  in february  the facility was reduced to an availability of million secured by five properties  and there was a zero balance outstanding 
this facility has also been used to provide a million letter of credit in connection with the pine island ridge plaza financing and to support approximately  in escrows for property taxes on the properties comprising its collateral  thereby reducing its gross availability to approximately million 
on september   we entered into a million revolving line of credit with bank leumi le israel bm this facility accrues interest at over the or day libor rate  at our option  and is payable monthly or quarterly depending on our rate selection 
the facility matures on september   with an option to extend it an additional days 
under the bank leumi credit agreement  we agreed not to mortgage or encumber seven of our properties  as amended on february  the outstanding balance on this facility was million as of december   and was increased to million as of march  on february   we entered into a variable rate revolving credit facility with wells fargo under which we may borrow up to million against a borrowing base of five properties pledged to secure the facility 
borrowings under the facility will bear interest  at our option  at the prime rate or based on libor plus a margin ranging from if the ratio of our total liabilities to gross asset value is less than  to if the ratio of our total liabilities to gross asset value is or exceeds the entire principal amount is due february  this new facility also prohibits shareholder distributions in excess of of funds for operations calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ending 
notwithstanding this limitation  we can make shareholder distributions to avoid income taxes on asset sales 
if a default under the facility exists  our ability to pay dividends would be limited to the amount necessary to maintain our status as a reit 
the facility also contains financial covenants that require us to maintain o a consolidated net worth of not less than million plus of net proceeds of equity issuances  o a ratio of total liabilities to gross asset value of not more than o a ratio of ebitda to interest expense of not less than  o a ratio of ebitda to fixed charges of not less than  and o an occupancy rate on properties in the borrowing base of not less than we expect to commence development in early of an  square foot shopping center on a parcel of land located at the southeast corner of sw th avenue and coral way in miami dade county  florida 
we anticipate the cost of development to be approximately million  including the million of costs we incurred upon the exercise of our option to purchase from several of our affiliates all of the outstanding shares of common stock of equity one coral way  inc the sole asset of which consisted of this parcel of land 
we expect to commence development in late of a  square foot drug store anchored shopping center on a parcel of land we already own at the northeast corner of sw th avenue and coral way in miami dade county  florida at a total cost of million 
development of phase three of the shops at skylake  totaling approximately  square feet is anticipated to commence and be completed in at an estimated cost of approximately million 
we expect to fund the costs of these development projects from cash flow from operations  borrowings under our various revolving credit facilities and other sources of cash  including obtaining permanent debt on certain unencumbered rental properties 
our debt level could subject us to various risks  including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest  and the risk that the resulting reduced financial flexibility could inhibit our ability to develop or improve our rental properties  withstand downturns in our rental income or take advantage of business opportunities 
in addition  because we currently anticipate that only a small portion of the principal of our indebtedness will be repaid prior to maturity  it is expected that it will be necessary to refinance the majority of our debt 
accordingly  there is a risk that such indebtedness will not be able to be refinanced or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our current indebtedness 
on august   we sold  unregistered shares of our common stock to alony hetz properties investments ltd 
at a price of per share  resulting in net proceeds of million 
on september   we sold  unregistered shares of our common stock to alony hetz at a price of per share  resulting in net proceeds of million 
on january   we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock to a limited number of accredited investors 
in connection with the private placement  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share to unaffiliated investors and  shares of our common stock at price of per share to investors that are affiliates of ours 
the million proceeds from the private placement were raised for general corporate purposes 
in addition  on january   we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission  which will permit us  from time to time  to offer and sell various types of securities  including common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  depositary shares and warrants  up to a value of million 
the registration statement provides us additional flexibility in accessing capital markets to fund future growth and for general corporate purposes 
we believe  based on currently proposed plans and assumptions relating to our operations  that our existing financial arrangements  together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for a period of at least twelve months 
in the event that our plans change  our assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate or cash flows from operations or amounts available under existing financing arrangements prove to be insufficient to fund our expansion and development efforts our to the extent we discover suitable acquisition targets the purchase price of which exceed our existing liquidity  we would be required to seek additional sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all and any equity financing could be dilutive to existing shareholders 
if adequate funds are not available  our business operations could be materially adversely affected 
we believe that we qualify and intend to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code 
as a reit  we are allowed to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of our distributions to stockholders 
as distributions have exceeded taxable income  no provision for federal income taxes has been made 
while we intend to continue to pay dividends to our stockholders  we also will reserve such amounts of cash flow as we consider necessary for the proper maintenance and improvement of our real estate  while still maintaining our qualification as a reit

in addition to ongoing amortization payments throughout the terms of the mortgages  our mortgage indebtedness outstanding at december  including the balance on our revolving credit facilities will require approximate balloon principal payments as follows balloon year due payments thereafter  total  we may not have sufficient funds on hand to repay these balloon amounts at maturity 
therefore  we expect to refinance this indebtedness either through additional mortgage financing secured by individual properties or groups of properties  by unsecured private or public debt offerings or by additional equity offerings 
our results of operations could be affected if the cost of refinancing debt is greater or lesser than existing debt 
if refinancing debt is not available  our business would be adversely affected

the effective date of this statement  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
an amendment of fasb statement no 
 is for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  a change in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged asset  liability or firm commitment through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  the adoption of sfas no 
had no effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in june  fasb approved the issuance of sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these standards  which were issued in july  established accounting and reporting for business combinations 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations entered into subsequent to june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
sfas no 
provides that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized  but will be tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted sfas no 
on january   at which time goodwill amortization ceased 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the new accounting standards on existing goodwill and other intangible assets 
for the year ended december   goodwill amortization was  in august  fasb issued sfas no

 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  as well as other earlier related pronouncements  either in whole or in part 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years  though earlier application is encouraged 
we do not expect that the adoption of this statement on january  will have a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
environmental matters we  like others in the commercial real estate industry  are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations 
the operation of dry cleaning facilities at our shopping centers is the principal environmental concern 
we believe that the tenants who operate these facilities do so in accordance with current laws and regulations and we have established procedures to monitor their operations 
additionally  we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers 
where available  we have applied and been accepted into state sponsored environmental programs 
we have a blanket environmental insurance policy that covers us against third party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination 
we have also placed environmental insurance on specific properties with known contamination in order to mitigate our environmental risk 
we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position  liquidity or operations 
inflation and recession considerations most of our leases contain provisions designed to partially mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
most of our leases require the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
a small portion of our leases also include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rents based on a tenant s gross sales above predetermined levels  which sales generally increase as prices rise  or escalation clauses which are typically related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
our financial results are affected by general economic conditions in the markets in which our properties are located 
an economic recession  or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions  could result in the inability of some of our existing tenants to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect our ability to attract or retain tenants 
supermarkets  drugstores and other anchor tenants that offer day to day necessities rather than luxury items anchor our existing properties 
these types of tenants  in our experience  generally maintain more consistent sales performance during periods of adverse economic conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk to which we have exposure is interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates can affect our net income and cash flows 
as changes in market conditions occur  interest rates can either increase or decrease  and interest expense from the variable component of our debt balances will move in the same direction 
with respect to our investment portfolio  changes in interest rates generally do not affect our interest income as our investments are predominantly in equity securities 
in addition  most of our mortgage notes payable currently have fixed interest rates and therefore changes in interest rates generally do not have a material effect on our operations 
however  some mortgage notes that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of cefus and uirt do have variable rates 
in addition  each of our city national  bank leumi and wells fargo facilities have a variable rate component and we may enter into additional variable rate facilities in the future 
therefore  increases in interest rates could in the future have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations 
moreover  increases in long term real estate mortgage rates that may occur over a decade or more may decrease the overall value of real estate 
we estimate the fair value of our long term  fixed rate mortgage loans generally using discounted cash flow analysis based on current borrowing rates for similar types of debt 
at december   the fair value of the mortgage loans was estimated to be approximately million compared to a carrying value amount of approximately million 
if the weighted average interest rate on our fixed rate debt at december  were basis points higher or lower  the fair market value would be approximately million and approximately million  respectively 
if the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt at december  were basis points higher or lower  annual interest expense would be increased or decreased by approximately  our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
we may use a variety of financial instruments to reduce our interest rate risk  including interest rate swap agreements whereby we exchange our variable interest costs on a defined amount of principal for another party s obligation to pay fixed interest on the same amount of principal  or interest rate caps  which will set a ceiling on the maximum variable interest rate we will incur on the amount of debt subject to the cap and for the time period specified in the interest rate cap 
as of december   we have no material market risk sensitive instruments
