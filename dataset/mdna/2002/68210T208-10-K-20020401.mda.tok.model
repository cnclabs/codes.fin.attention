recent developments in the fourth quarter of  we began experiencing a significant increase in the number of bid requests from our customers 
this resulted in an increase in our backlog from december  of million to million at december  in november we completed negotiations with our lenders to extend the maturity of all of our senior credit facilities to august  restructure the amortization of the term debt  and reduce the rate of interest paid on certain outstanding indebtedness 
we recently announced the acquisition of the assets of airjac drilling  a division of veritas dgc land  inc  a seismic drilling support company headquartered in new iberia  louisiana 
the aggregate purchase price was million cash 
in this acquisition we acquired the following types of equipment types of equipment number of units acquired highland drilling units water buggies aluminum marsh atvs airboat drilling units swamp atvs pullboats pontoon boats skid mounted drilling units general demand 
we receive our revenues from customers in the energy industry 
demand for our services is principally impacted by conditions affecting geophysical companies engaged in the acquisition of d seismic data 
the level of activity among geophysical companies is primarily influenced by the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies for seismic data acquisition activities 
a number of factors affect the decision of oil and gas companies to pursue the acquisition of seismic data  including i prevailing and expected oil and gas demand and prices  ii the cost of exploring for  producing and developing oil and gas reserves  iii the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves  iv the availability and cost of permits and consents from landowners to conduct seismic activity  v local and international political and economic conditions  vi governmental regulations  and vii the availability and cost of capital 
the ability to finance the acquisition of seismic data in the absence of oil and gas companies interest in obtaining the information is also a factor as some geophysical companies will acquire seismic data on a speculative basis 
during  with the reduction in the price of oil and gas  we began to experience a decrease in demand for our services 
in  the market experienced a rebound 
for the years ended december   and  our operating revenues were million  million  and million  respectively 
seasonality and weather risks 
our operations are subject to seasonal variations in weather conditions and daylight hours 
since our activities take place outdoors  on average  fewer hours are worked per day and fewer holes are generally drilled or surveyed per day in winter months than in summer months due to an increase in rainy  foggy  and cold conditions and a decrease in daylight hours 
results of operations the following discussion provides information related to the results of our operations

  operating revenues increased  or million  from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was due primarily to an upswing in the seismic market in as a result  drilling revenues doubled from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our newly formed permitting division reported revenues of million for the year ended december  with no revenues reported for the corresponding period of survey revenues decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily due to our decision to concentrate our personnel  equipment and available working capital on the more profitable segments of the seismic industry 
aviation revenues decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as we continue to reduce our seismic aviation fleet to concentrate on the more profitable offshore market 
operating revenues in are expected to continue to increase due to an increased demand for our services 
operating expenses increased  or million  from million in to million in operating payroll expense increased million from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the significant increase in seismic activity has resulted in a corresponding increase in the amount of personnel employed  as the average number of field employees has increased to in compared to in also  as a result of the increased activity levels in as compared to  explosives expenses increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  contracting services increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  principally as a result of the commencement of our newly formed permitting division 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in the repairs and maintenance expense  rental expense and related insurance expense on leased aviation equipment 
the decreases resulted from fewer helicopters being leased from third parties during compared to depreciation expense and property and casualty insurance expense decreased million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  because of an overall reduction in our operating equipment 
operating expenses are expected to continue to increase in as operating revenues increase 
gross profit increased million  or  from a gross loss of million to a gross profit of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase is a result of increased business activity in our more profitable business segments  increased prices received for the services provided and more stringent controls over operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million for compared to million for payroll expenses accounted for of this decrease as they decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease is due to a reduction in the average number of administrative employees between the periods  as well as significantly reduced base compensation levels of our management 
we realized approximately million in savings during by renegotiating certain lease and vendor agreements with terms more favorable to us than those agreements in we experienced a million reduction in each of entertainment and communications expenses from the year ended december  to the year ended december  amortization expense decreased million from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively  due to the asset impairment charges realized in the latter part of see note 
general and administrative expenses are expected to increase slightly in due to increased business activity 
during  we realized asset impairment charges of million see note compared to million in 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  other income increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily from the receipt of million in proceeds from a key man life insurance policy procured on the life our ceo  who was killed in a private aircraft accident in february the increase was also due to million of net losses on the sale of assets in offset by million in interest income in for the year ended december  and  losses incurred by us generated additional net operating loss carryforwards for which a reserve has been provided see note  resulting in income tax benefit expense of in each year 
accretion of preferred stock increased million from for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase is due to the accretion of dividends at during the free dividend period from april through june for our preferred stock

net loss   operating revenues decreased  or million  from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was due primarily to a depressed seismic market throughout as a result of the decline in the seismic activity and adverse pricing during the last year  drilling and survey revenues decreased million and million  to million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  no revenues were generated from our south american joint venture for the year ended december  compared to million in the prior year 
operating expenses decreased  or million  from million in to million in declines in payroll costs accounted for of this decrease as operating payroll expense decreased from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the significant decrease in seismic activity has resulted in a corresponding decrease in the amount of personnel employed  as the average number of field employees has declined to in compared to in also  as a result of the lower activity levels in as compared to  explosives  repairs and maintenance and rentals and leases expenses decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  gross operating loss increased million  or  from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily as a result of substantially lower domestic revenues from our drilling  aviation and survey segments 
general and administrative expenses were million for compared to million for  resulting in a decrease 
payroll expenses decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  these decreases are due to the reduction in the workforce implemented by us due to the declines in the market environment 
bad debt expense decreased million from million in december   all of which in related to a customer that filed bankruptcy 
we experienced a reduction in travel  office and supplies  communications  and rentals and leases expenses due to decreased activity levels from million to million in the years ended december  and  respectively

we extended the maturity dates for all of our secured indebtedness outstanding  and negotiated a fixed interest rate reduction on approximately million of this secured indebtedness 
our backlog at december  approximated million  compared to million at december  in the years ended december   and  we privately placed a total of million  million and million  respectively  in subordinated debentures with an affiliate 
the debentures had interest rates of either a fixed rate of or a rate that started at and escalated over the life of the note to 
the debentures were due five years from the date of issuance with interest payable quarterly

the remaining million has been classified as due to affiliate 
on october   we completed the private placement of approximately million shares of common stock for approximately million 
the purchasers of the common stock also received options or warrants to acquire approximately million shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the terms of the private placement gave the shareholders the right to put their stock back to us in the event of the death of our ceo 
to secure this put right  we purchased key man life insurance on our ceo in the amount of million 
in addition  we issued shares of series a preferred stock for million in cash and also converted approximately million of subordinated debt to  shares of series a preferred stock 
this conversion reduced the amount of outstanding subordinated debentures to million at december  in connection with the completion of these capital transactions  we reached agreements with our secured lenders to extend the maturity dates of approximately million in outstanding indebtedness until january the proceeds of the private placement of stock were used to repay million of secured indebtedness and provide working capital

at december   we had approximately million in cash compared to approximately million at december  we had working capital of approximately million at december   compared to approximately million at december  the increase in working capital is due to improved profitability resulting in a significant decrease in accrued expenses  a significant increase in accounts receivable  and the classification of the line of credit as long term

other than the acquisitions discussed in notes and  we have no material commitments outstanding for expenditures nor do we anticipate acquiring a significant amount of capital assets in contractual commitments we have the following contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than after total year years years long term debt     capital lease obligations   operating leases total contractual cash     we believe that cash flow generated from operations in will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cautionary statements this annual report contains forward looking statements 
such statements include  without limitation  statements regarding our expectations regarding revenue levels  profitability and costs  the expected results of our business strategy  and other plans and objectives of management for future operations and activities 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include  without limitation  our dependence on activity in the oil and gas industry  risks associated with our rapid growth  dependence on a relatively small number of significant customers  seasonality and weather risks  the hazardous conditions and difficult terrain in which we operate  and risks associated with our international expansion 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
related party transactions during the year ended december  we leased a facility from a major shareholder at a total lease expense of million  which approximated market values 
we were under a lease contract for a portion of see note

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation on our consolidated financial statements 
we extend credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business 
we regularly review outstanding receivables  and provide for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluation the level of established reserves  we make judgments regarding the parties ability to make required payments  economic events and other factors 
as the financial condition of these parties change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful account may be required 
due to the nature of our industry  we have a concentration of credit risks 
as a result  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be significant 
we have made significant investments in inventory to service our equipment 
on a routine basis  we use judgments in determining the level of reserves required to state inventory at the lower of cost or market 
our estimates are primarily influenced by technological innovations  market activity levels and the physical condition of products 
changes in these or other factors may result in adjustments to the carrying value of inventory 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences between the book basis and tax basis of our net assets 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
we have established reserves to reduce our net deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value 
if tax regulations change  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
we record liabilities for environmental obligations when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
our estimates are based on currently enacted laws and regulations 
as more information becomes available or environmental laws and regulations change  such liabilities may be required to be adjusted 
additionally  in connection with acquisitions  we obtain indemnifications from the seller related to environmental matters 
if the indemnifying parties do not fulfill their obligations  adjustments of recorded amounts may be required 
we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
we retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and self funded insurance programs 
we regularly review estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for losses through insurance reserves 
as claims develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required 
recently issued accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  establishes accounting and reporting standards that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at our fair value 
we adopted sfas on january   however  adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position 
in july  sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets were issued 
sfas requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life 
the amortization provisions of sfas apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   we are required to adopt sfas effective january  as of december   we have goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  of million 
we believe that adoption of the provisions of sfas that are effective january  will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we recognized approximately  and  in goodwill amortization expense for the year ended december  and  respectively 
in august  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets was issued 
these new rules on asset impairment supersede sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and will be effective for our fiscal year beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact that adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements 
on june  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa released an exposure draft of a proposed statement of position sop  accounting for certain costs and activities related to property  plant  and equipment 
this proposed sop would change  among other things  the method by which companies would account for normal  recurring or periodic repairs and maintenance costs related to in service fixed assets 
it would require that these types of expenses would be recognized when incurred rather than accruing these expenses while the asset is in service 
we are assessing the impact of the change should this sop be adopted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates  primarily in the united states 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
we currently do not use any derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
the table below provides information about the future maturities of principal for outstanding debt instruments at december  all instruments described are non traded instruments and approximated fair value 
dollars in thousands long term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate    average interest rate short term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate foreign currency risks our transactions are in us dollars 
previously  we had one subsidiary  which conducted our operations in canadian dollars 
however  those operations were closed in july currently  the south american joint venture transacts all of its activity in us dollars 
operations in south america have been curtailed pending future developments in that market
