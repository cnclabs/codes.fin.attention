item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal continued to be a difficult period for the manufactured housing industry due to three major issues retail financing availability  repossessions and retail inventory levels 
elevated credit standards  which began in mid  resulted in reduced retail sales levels  declining wholesale shipments and declining margins for most industry participants 
industry wide multi section shipments for calendar were down from a year ago  however  palm harbor s shipments declined less than during this same period 
at the end of fiscal  additional issues arose in the manufactured housing industry 
in march  the largest floor plan lender in the industry  conseco finance servicing corp 
conseco  announced that they were exiting the wholesale financing  or floor plan lending  business 
our agreement with conseco  which totals million  will be cancelled on june  in anticipation of such cancellation  we obtained an additional million of floor plan financing during the fourth quarter of fiscal as of may   palm harbor had floor plan borrowings of million with conseco and we had receivables due from conseco of approximately million 
we believe amounts due from conseco will be collected in the normal course of business and palm harbor will not incur significant losses as the result of doing business with conseco 
on may   conseco indicated its commitment to continue to provide retail financing  however  they also began notifying manufacturers and independent retailers that amounts due under floor plan financing agreements were to be paid in full on or prior to july  however  conseco also indicated in the notification that certain options would be made available to the retailers 
palm harbor has contacted our independent retailers where we have repurchase obligations regarding the impact of this cancellation on their floor plan financing needs 
the majority of these retailers have made other arrangements for their financing needs 
additionally  the introduction of texas house bill in january presented another issue to the industry 
this bill requires all manufactured houses in texas  which are not placed in manufactured home rental communities  to be financed with conforming mortgages 
conforming mortgages are subject to higher credit standards than chattel loans and therefore this new regulation may cause certain consumers who would have otherwise qualified for financing under a chattel loan to not qualify under a conforming loan 
through countryplace mortgage  palm harbor sells approved loan contracts to one of three national finance companies  including associates housing finance 
in january  the associates announced that they would be discontinuing retail and floor plan financing for the manufactured housing industry 
palm harbor s contract with the associates expired on march  consumer loan contracts have been redirected to the remaining finance companies and or to new finance companies as agreements are negotiated 
the company believes that they will be able to continue to redirect consumer loan contracts  however  no assurances can be made in this regard 
despite these difficult conditions  both palm harbor s business segments were profitable this fiscal year 
additionally  palm harbor maintained gross margins  profitably increased market share and reduced inventories  while continuing our controlled growth strategy of opening new retail superstores 
during fiscal  the number of company owned retail superstores increased by six to the financial services segment  which consists of countryplace mortgage  palm harbor s finance subsidiary  and standard casualty company  palm harbor s insurance subsidiary  continued to be additive to consolidated sales and net income 
palm harbor had cash and cash equivalents of million at march  and virtually no long term debt 
in addition  palm harbor s practice of manufacturing only to order coupled with closely monitored retail receivables and stocking levels has enabled us to tightly manage retail receivables and inventory levels 
receivables and inventory per retail superstore have declined since the beginning of the fiscal year 
gross margin remained stable at 
the manufactured housing industry is affected by cyclical downturns and seasonal fluctuations that often make difficult period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results 
the following table sets forth certain items of palm harbor s statement of income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated

palm harbor s fiscal year consists of or weeks  ending on the friday nearest the last day of march each year 
the and fiscal years consisted of weeks and the fiscal year consisted of weeks 
compared to net sales 
net sales decreased to million in from million in the decrease in net sales was primarily due to competitive conditions in the manufactured housing industry as indicated by a decrease of in the volume of homes sold through company owned retail superstores while overall unit volume  which includes sales to independent retailers  declined in fiscal this decline in volume is partially offset by an increase in the average selling price of a new home  which resulted from a continued shift in product mix towards multi section homes 
of the homes sold by the company  were multi section in fiscal versus in fiscal the number of company owned superstores increased from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal gross profit 
in fiscal  gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to from in fiscal gross profit decreased to million in compared to million in palm harbor sold of its homes through company owned retail superstores in both fiscal and fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased  as planned  to in from in selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in  primarily due to palm harbor s continued commitment to building brand awareness via advertising  startup expenses associated with the net increase of six retail superstores opened during fiscal as well as those expected to be opened in fiscal and training costs associated with people development 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the prime interest rate from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal coupled with a decrease in the floor plan liability 
compared to net sales 
net sales decreased to million in from million in the decrease in net sales was primarily due to competitive conditions in the manufactured housing industry as indicated by a decrease of in the volume of homes sold through company owned superstores while overall unit volume  which includes sales to independent retailers  declined in fiscal this decline in volume is partially offset by an increase in the average selling price of a new home  which resulted from a continued shift in product mix towards multi section homes

gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to compared to in fiscal gross profit decreased to million in compared to million in palm harbor sold of its homes through company owned retail superstores in fiscal versus in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in  primarily due to palm harbor s continued focus on reducing fixed expenses company wide 
this decrease was partially offset by the continued commitment to building brand awareness via advertising and expenses associated with the net increase of company owned retail superstores 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased  as planned  to in from in this increase is due to the growth in palm harbor s retail operations which  generally  have higher selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales as compared to wholesale operations 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to increases in both the average floor plan balance and interest rates from fiscal to fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  compared to million in and million in cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal primarily due to decreases in accounts receivable and inventories 
cash provided by operations was adequate to support palm harbor s working capital needs  capital expenditures  floor plan payments and investment purchases during fiscal capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in  capital expenditures included million for additional retail superstores and approximately million primarily for improvements in mature manufacturing facilities 
in  capital expenditures included million for additional retail superstores and approximately million primarily for improvements in mature manufacturing facilities 
in  capital expenditures included million for additional retail superstores and approximately million primarily for improvements in mature manufacturing facilities 
palm harbor expects capital expenditures to approximate million during primarily for the purpose of adding retail superstores 
palm harbor currently has four floor plan facilities with financial institutions totaling million to finance a major portion of the home inventory at our retail superstores 
these facilities are secured by a portion of our home inventory and receivables from financial institutions 
the interest rates on the facilities range from prime at march  to prime plus 
one of our facilities totaling million with conseco of which million was outstanding at march  will be cancelled on june  in anticipation of such floor plan cancellation  we increased one of our other facilities by million during the fourth quarter of fiscal palm harbor has three facilities totaling million  which require notification six months prior to cancellation 
such notification has not been received by palm harbor from any of these three financial institutions 
these floor plan facilities contain provisions regarding minimum financial requirements which the company must maintain in order to borrow against the facilities 
palm harbor had  and  outstanding on these floor plan credit facilities at march  and march   respectively 
two of palm harbor s floor plan financing agreements permit us to earn interest on investments made with the financial institutions  which can be withdrawn without any imposed restrictions 
these investments have certain limitations depending upon the amount of floor plan balance outstanding 
the interest rate earned on the amounts invested is prime at march  minus 
palm harbor had  and  invested at march  and march   respectively  and has classified these amounts as cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
palm harbor has two revolving lines of credit one million committed and one million uncommitted from a financial institution for general corporate purposes 
the lines of credit bear interest  at the option under certain conditions of palm harbor  at either the libor rate at march  plus or the prime rate at march  minus 
the lines of credit contain provisions regarding minimum financial requirements and certain indebtedness limitations which would limit the amount available for future borrowings 
palm harbor s borrowing capacity on the lines of credit is reduced by letters of credit totaling million 
the lines of credit are available through june   and require an annual commitment fee of up to  palm harbor has received a commitment letter from the financial institution which extends the availability of the lines of credit through june palm harbor had no amounts outstanding on the lines of credit at march  and march  through countryplace mortgage  palm harbor sells approved loan contracts to one of three national finance companies  including associates housing finance 
in january  the associates announced that they would be discontinuing retail and floor plan financing for the manufactured housing industry 
palm harbor s contract with the associates expired on march  consumer loan contracts have been redirected to the remaining finance companies and or to new finance companies as agreements are negotiated 
the company believes that they will be able to continue to redirect consumer loan contracts  however  no assurances can be made in this regard 
in july  palm harbor s board of directors authorized  subject to certain business and market conditions  the use of up to million to repurchase palm harbor s common stock 
in july  the board of directors authorized another million for common stock repurchases 
as of may   palm harbor had invested million in the common stock buyback program 
palm harbor believes that cash flows from operations  together with floor plan financing and our revolving lines of credit  will be adequate to support our working capital  currently planned capital expenditure needs and future share repurchases in the foreseeable future 
palm harbor may  from time to time  obtain additional floor plan financing for our retail inventories 
such practice is customary in the industry 
however  because future cash flows and the availability of financing will depend on a number of factors  including prevailing economic and financial conditions  business and other factors beyond palm harbor s control  no assurances can be given in this regard 
contractual obligations and commitments dollars in thousands the following tables summarize palm harbor s contractual obligations and contingent commitments at march  for additional information related to these obligations  see the notes to consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period less than after total year years years years long term debt   operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts less than over committed year years years years repurchase obligations    letters of credit    total commercial commitments    palm harbor has contingent repurchase obligations outstanding at march  which have a finite life but are replaced as palm harbor continues to sell our manufactured homes to dealers under repurchase agreements with financial institutions 
the cost of these contingent repurchase obligations to palm harbor was   and  during fiscal   and  respectively 
for additional information on palm harbor s repurchase obligations  see critical accounting policies reserve for repurchase obligations 
palm harbor has provided letters of credit to providers of certain of our insurance policies 
while the current letters of credit have a finite life  they are subject to renewal at different amounts based on the requirements of the insurance carriers 
palm harbor has recorded insurance expense based on anticipated losses related to these policies as is customary in the manufactured housing industry 
palm harbor has contingent obligations related to installment loan contracts sold with recourse 
see note to the financial statements for a discussion of such recourse contingent obligations 
critical accounting policies palm harbor s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires palm harbor to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
impairment of intangible assets 
in assessing the recoverability of palm harbor s intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  palm harbor may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
effective march   palm harbor adopted statement of financial standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and is now required to analyze goodwill for impairment issues on an annual basis 
the carrying value of the goodwill was assessed for impairment as of march  and there was no indication of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
warranties 
palm harbor provides the retail home buyer a one year limited warranty covering defects in material or workmanship in home structure  plumbing and electrical systems 
we record a liability for estimated future warranty costs relating to homes sold  based upon our assessment of historical experience factors 
factors we use in the estimation of the warranty liability include historical warranty experience related to the actual number of calls and the average cost per call 
although we maintain reserves for such claims based on our assessments as described above  which to date have been adequate  there can be no assurance that warranty expense levels will remain at current levels or that such reserves will continue to be adequate 
a large number of warranty claims exceeding our current warranty expense levels could have a material effect on palm harbor s results of operations 
reserve for repurchase obligations 
manufactured housing companies enter into repurchase agreements with financial institutions which have provided wholesale floor plan financing to independent retailers 
these agreements generally provide that in the event of a retailer s default palm harbor will repurchase the financed home from the lending institution at declining prices over the term of the repurchase agreement generally months 
the risk of loss under such repurchase agreements is mitigated by the fact that i only of palm harbor harbor s homes are sold to independent retailers  ii a majority of the homes sold by palm harbor to independent retailers are pre sold to specific retail customers  iii palm harbor monitors each retailer s inventory position on a regular basis  iv sales of palm harbor s manufactured homes are spread over a large number of retailers  v none of palm harbor s independent retailers accounted for more than of palm harbor s net sales in fiscal  vi the price palm harbor is obligated to pay declines over time and vii palm harbor is  in most cases  able to resell homes repurchased from credit sources in the ordinary course of business without incurring significant losses 
since mid  the manufactured housing industry has been affected by three major challenges retail financing availability  repossessions and retail inventory levels 
the rapid growth in the number of retailers prior to the deterioration of retail financing has resulted in an imbalance between retail inventory levels and consumer demand 
if retail financing was to significantly weaken further  the inventory imbalance could result in even greater price competition  gross margin deterioration and have an overall material adverse effect on palm harbor s operating results 
while palm harbor s practice of manufacturing only to order coupled with closely monitored retail stocking levels has enabled us to continue to tightly manage inventories  we are unable to predict the impact on palm harbor s results if industry conditions were to further deteriorate 
residual interests 
countryplace mortgage originates and sells loan contracts to national consumer finance companies and receives cash and or retains a residual interest in the interest generated by the sold contracts 
since april  substantially all interest income on the sold contracts has been received in cash upon sale of the contracts 
prior to april  a residual interest in the interest generated by the sold contracts was retained and recorded 
residual interests in installment sales contracts sold are recorded at fair value when the company relinquishes control of the transferred financial assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of sfas no 
and other related pronouncements 
the gain on sale of these contracts is included in revenues net of any estimated recourse obligations  while unrealized gains are included as a component of retained earnings 
during the life of the loan  accretion income or expense  as appropriate  is included in revenues and the related receivables on residual interests are marked to fair value at the end of each reporting period through comprehensive income 
the gain or loss on the sale of the installment sales contracts depends in part on the previous carrying amount of the contracts  allocated between the contracts sold and the retained interests based upon their respective fair values at the date of sale 
the fair value of the residual interest is determined by discounting the projected cash flows over the expected life of the contracts sold using a number of estimates and assumptions including prepayment  default  and interest rates 
company estimates of prepayment and default rates are determined based upon a model developed by the company and refined to reflect company specific experience and trends 
at march   the company had net receivables of approximately million related to the retained residual interests of loan contracts previously sold by countryplace 
recourse obligations 
in some cases  countryplace shares in losses resulting from defaults or prepayments of loan contracts previously sold and therefore establishes a reserve for estimated losses at the time the loan contract is sold 
at march   the company had net reserve balances of approximately million for future losses 
the reserve for recourse obligation is established based upon historical loss experience  current economic conditions  and industry trends 
management periodically evaluates its reserve for recourse obligations based upon the performance of outstanding receivables remaining in the portfolio in comparison to projected performance when the reserves were established  actual loss history  geographic concentrations  and the estimated value of the underlying collateral 
new accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
effective march   palm harbor adopted sfas no 
 which supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the standard retains the previously existing accounting requirements related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used while expanding the measurement requirements of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale to include discontinued operations 
it also expands on the previously existing reporting requirements for discontinued operations to include a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on palm harbor s financial statements 
forward looking information risk factors certain statements contained in this annual report are forward looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the securities litigation reform act 
forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events and can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
investors should be aware that all forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and  as a result of certain factors  actual results could differ materially from these expressed in or implied by such statements 
these risks include such assumptions  risks  uncertainties and factors associated with the following o availability of retail financing 
since mid  loans to purchase manufactured houses have been subjected to elevated credit standards  resulting in reduced lending volumes and consequently reduced sales in the manufactured housing industry 
a further tightening of credit standards may cause palm harbor to experience significant sales declines 
o availability of wholesale financing 
the largest floor plan lender has chosen to exit the manufactured housing business  thereby reducing the amount of credit available to industry retailers 
further reductions in the availability of floor plan lending may affect palm harbor s inventory levels of new homes 
o management s ability to attract and retain executive officers and other key personnel 
palm harbor is dependent on the services and performance of our executive officers  including our chairman of the board  lee posey and our president and chief executive officer  larry keener 
the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
o control by existing shareholders 
approximately of the outstanding common stock of palm harbor is beneficially owned or controlled by mr 
posey  capital southwest corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary  capital southwest venture corporation and william r 
thomas  president of capital southwest corporation 
as a result  these shareholders  acting together  will be able to determine the outcome of elections of palm harbor s directors and thereby control the management of palm harbor s business 
o impact of inflation 
the past several years have shown a relatively moderate rate of inflation which palm harbor has been able to offset through increased selling prices 
a material increase in inflation in the future could adversely affect palm harbor s operating results 
o competitive product advertising  promotional and pricing activity 
there are numerous manufactured housing companies in the industry and many have their own retail distribution systems and consumer finance operations 
in addition to competition within the manufactured housing industry  our products also compete with other forms of lower to moderate cost housing  including site built homes  apartments  townhouses and condominiums 
if we are unable to address this competition  growth in each segment of our business could be limited 
o cyclicality of the manufactured housing industry 
the cyclical and seasonal nature of the industry causes our revenues and operating results to fluctuate and makes it hard for management to forecast sales and profits in uncertain times 
as a result of seasonal and cyclical downturns  we may experience fluctuations in our operating results that make difficult period to period comparisons 
o volatility in our stock price 
our stock is traded on the nasdaq national stock market and is therefore subject to market fluctuations 
during fiscal  our stock price ranged from a low of per share to a high of per share 
o terrorist attacks 
market disruptions and other effects resulting from the terrorist attacks on september  and actions  including armed conflict by the united states and other governments in reaction thereto 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk palm harbor is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt  which consists primarily of our liabilities under retail floor plan financing arrangements 
palm harbor is not involved in any other market risk sensitive contracts or investments such as interest rate swaps  futures contracts  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
for variable interest rate obligations  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
assuming palm harbor s level of variable rate debt as of march  is held constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates occurring on the first day of the year would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately million
