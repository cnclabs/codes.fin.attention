forward looking statements are used to describe future plans and strategies  including expectations of the company s future financial results 
management s ability to predict results or the effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain 
factors which could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to  general and local economic conditions  changes in interest rates  deposit flows  demand for mortgages and other loans  real estate values  competition  loan delinquency rates  changes in accounting principles  practices  policies or guidelines  changes in legislation or regulation  and other economic  competitive governmental  regulatory and technological factors effecting operations  pricing  products and services 
accordingly  these factors should be considered in evaluating the forward looking statements  and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements

however  the use of judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in our results of operation and financial condition 
the company has determined that its most critical accounting policy is the determination of its provision for loan losses 
see additional discussion under comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and provision for loan losses in this section 
general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto contained in this report 
the company  an oregon corporation  became the unitary savings and loan holding company of pioneer bank  a federal savings bank the bank upon the bank s conversion from a federally chartered mutual to a federally chartered stock savings bank the conversion on october  accordingly  the company is primarily engaged in the business of planning  directing and coordinating the business activities of the bank  the deposits of which are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic under the savings association insurance fund saif

the bank operates as a community oriented financial institution devoted to serving the needs of its customers 
the bank s business consists generally of attracting retail deposits from the general public and using those funds to originate one to four family residential loans  consumer loans and commercial loans in its market area 
to a lesser extent the bank also purchases loans in or near its market area and utilizes wholesale funding from the federal home loan bank of seattle fhlb 
the bank s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and the cost of its interest bearing liabilities  consisting of deposits and fhlb borrowings 
the bank s net income is also affected by  among other things  fee income  provisions for loan losses  operating expenses and income tax provisions 
the bank s results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government legislation and policies concerning monetary and fiscal affairs  housing and financial institutions and the attendant actions of the regulatory authorities 
comparison of financial condition at march  and march  total assets at march  increased million to million compared to million at march  the growth in assets is primarily attributable to a million increase in net loans receivable partially offset by a million decrease in securities 
the increase in loans receivable was caused by a million increase in commercial real estate loans  a million increase in commercial and agricultural loans and a million increase in consumer loans partially offset by a million decrease in residential real estate loans 
the decrease in residential real estate loans reflects the company s strategy to decrease interest rate risk by selling newly originated fixed rate real estate loans 
the net loan growth was funded by million increase in borrowings and million increase in deposits offset by a million decrease in shareholders equity 
the increase in deposits reflects the company s emphasis on core deposit growth 
demand and savings accounts at march  increased by a total of million  or  to million compared to million at march  certificates of deposits decreased by million  or partially offsetting the growth in core deposits 
the decrease in shareholders equity was largely caused by the company purchasing million of its stock  paying million of dividends  and partially offset by earnings of million 
generally  the company purchases its outstanding shares through formal share repurchase programs  when purchases are thought to be accretive to earnings per share and the company has excess capital available for such purchases 
comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and general 
net income for the year ended march  was million or per basic share compared to net income of million or per share for the year ended march  the increase in net income is due to a million increase in net interest income  a million increase in non interest income  and a  decrease in non interest expense 
the decrease in non interest expense in the year ended march  was largely due to one time restructuring expenses incurred in the year ended march  including a  reduction in force charge and a  loss on sale of low yielding securities 
the substantial increase in earnings per share are a result of a favorable interest rate environment as well as the successful execution of the company s strategic plan which required the development of sustainable earnings per share growth as its primary objective 
related objectives included  but were not limited to  reduction of interest rate sensitive assets  non interest income growth  non interest expense control  core deposit growth and a company wide emphasis of customer service combined with a de emphasis of best price 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended march  was million compared to million for the year ended march   a decrease of  or 
the decrease in interest income was a result of a basis point decrease in the yield on average interest earning assets to for the year ended march  compared to for the year ended march  average interest earning assets increased by  to million during the year ended march   partially offsetting the reduction in yield on those assets 
the decrease in the yield on average interest earning assets is a result of a decreasing rate environment in as well as increases in adjustable rate loans and a decrease in fixed rate real estate loans 
the average yield on interest earning asset groups for the year ended march  compared to the year ended march  were as follows loans receivable versus  mortgage backed securities versus  investment securities versus  fhlb stock versus  and cash and overnight investments versus  respectively 
the average balance of interest earning assets for the year ended march  compared to the year ended march  were as follows loans receivable million versus million  mortgage backed securities million versus million  investment securities million versus million  fhlb stock million versus million  and cash and overnight investments million versus million  respectively 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended march  was million compared to million for the year ended march   a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in interest expense was due to a basis point reduction in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the year ended march  to from during the year ended march  the decrease in the average cost of liabilities was partially offset by a million  or increase in average interest bearing liabilities to million for the year ended march  versus million for the year ended march  the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the year ended march  compared to the year ended march  were as follows interest checking versus  savings versus  money market versus  certificates of deposit versus  respectively 
the average balance of interest bearing liabilities for the year ended march  compared to the year ended march  were as follows interest checking million versus million  savings million versus million  money market million versus million  certificates of deposit million versus million  respectively 
provision and allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses are changes to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to levels considered by management as adequate to provide for known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  including management s continuing analysis of factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in portfolio size and composition  actual loan loss experience  current and anticipated economic conditions  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured  and determination of the existence and realizable value of the collateral and guarantees securing the loans 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s methodology for calculating the necessary allowance for loan losses requires the company to reserve specific percentages of outstanding loan balances with the percentages varying based upon the perceived risk of the different loan types and loan classification within specific loan types 
additionally  the company has  of unallocated reserves 
unallocated reserves were added in to help bring the company s allowance for loan losses in line with the reserves of its peer institutions and to be reflective of the increased risk in the loan portfolio stemming from the growth in commercial  agricultural and consumer loans 
loans classified as doubtful at march  increased by  compared to the prior year  in which the company had no loans classified as doubtful 
the increase in doubtful loans caused the allowance for loan losses to be increased by loans classified as substandard decreased  to  at march  compared to million at march  the decrease in substandard loans caused the allowance to be decreased by  loans classified as other loans especially mentioned decreased by  to  at march  from million at march  the decrease in other loans especially mentioned caused the allowance to be decreased by  loans that were not classified as doubtful  substandard  or other loans especially mentioned increased by million  causing the allowance to be increased by  the unclassified reserve decreased by  to  at march  from  at march  the combination of changes in the amount of classified loans  total loans outstanding  trends in loan quality  micro and macro economic factors caused an aggregate increase in the allowance for loan losses for the year ended march  of  the provision for loan losses for the year ended march  was  while net charge offs for the year were  at march  the allowance for loan losses was of total loans compared to at march  the allowance for loan losses was of non performing loans at march  non interest income 
non interest income for the year ended march  increased by  or million  to million when compared to the year ended march  the increase in non interest income was principally due to a  increase in income from bank owned life insurance  a  net increase in gain on sale of securities and a  gain on sale of loans 
non interest expenses 
non interest expense for the year ended march  decreased by  or  to million from million for the year ended march  the primary factors affecting the decrease in non interest expense were  of losses on sales of securities in the year ended march  compared to no net losses for the year ended march   million of legal expenses in fiscal versus  of legal expenses in fiscal  and million of compensation and benefits in fiscal compared to million of compensation and benefits in fiscal the increased legal expenses in fiscal were due to increased litigation activity which have subsequently been settled 
the higher compensation and benefits in fiscal were largely due to restructuring charges associated with a reduction in force 
income taxes 
income tax expense was million for the year ended march  compared to  for the prior year 
the company s effective tax rate for the years ended march  and were and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate has benefitted by increased levels of tax advantaged assets 
in the year ended march  a  tax benefit related to the company s employee stock ownership plan in fiscal reduced earnings in fiscal comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and general 
net income for the year ended march  was million or per basic share  compared to net income of million or 
per basic share  for the year ended march  the reduction in net income is due to restructuring charges taken in the second and third quarters of  including a  reduction in force charge  a  boost to loss reserves reflecting increasing commercial loans and a  loss on sale of low yielding securities 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended march  was million compared to million for the year ended march   an increase of million  or 
the increase in interest income was a result of an increase of million in average balances of interest earning assets and a increase in the average yield on those assets 
the increased yield on interest earning assets was attributable to a higher interest rate environment in versus as well as execution of the strategic plan  which required the liquidation of low yielding securities and loan pricing methodology changes which emphasize service over price 
average loans receivable for the year ended march  increased by million  or  when compared to the year ended march  interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended march  was million compared to million for the prior year  an increase of million  or 
the increase in interest expense was due to the million growth in average interest bearing liabilities and the increase in the average cost of all interest bearing liabilities from to 
average interest bearing deposit balances increased million to million while average borrowing balances increased to million for the year ended march  the cost of average interest bearing liabilities increased basis points for deposits and basis points for borrowings  reflecting market increases in interest rates as well as greater sensitivity of the bank s borrowings as compared to its deposits 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses represents charges to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to levels considered by management as adequate to provide for known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  including management s continuing analysis of factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in portfolio size and composition  actual loan loss experience  current and anticipated economic conditions  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured  and determination of the existence and realizable value of the collateral and guarantees securing the loans 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses increased by  to million at march  in the year ended march   the company experienced a increase in agricultural  commercial and consumer loans while total loans grew at a rate of from march  levels 
management deemed a greater provision necessary due to the higher percentage growth in the agricultural  commercial and consumer loans  which are inherently riskier than one to four family mortgage loans 
net charge offs remained low for coming in at  or of average outstanding loans  compared to  or  for the prior year 
the allowance for loan losses equaled of non performing loans at march  compared to of non performing loans at march  management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate at march  noninterest income 
noninterest income increased by  to a level of million for the year ended march  this increase resulted primarily from a increase in core deposit fees 
the increase in core deposit fees reflects the successful addition of several new deposit products and services implemented to increase fee income and cause the bank s earnings to be less subject to changes in interest rates 
noninterest expenses 
noninterest operating expenses increased by million from million for the year ended march   to million for the year ended march  the increase in expenses was largely due to million of restructuring charges which consisted of  in realized losses on sales of securities and  in reduction of force charges 
total non cash compensation expense related to stock based compensation and benefits amounted to  for the year representing a decrease from the year ended march  amount of  depreciation expense increased  due to additional buildings and other capital expenditures 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was  for the year ended march  compared to million for the year ended march  decreasing the effective tax rate from for the prior year to for the current year 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the addition of two qualified zone academy loans made to local school districts which provide the bank with tax credits  as well as a higher percentage of municipal interest income

market risk and asset and liability management market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the bank s market risk arises principally from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  investment  deposit and borrowing activities 
management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
although the bank manages other risks  such as credit quality and liquidity risk  in the normal course of business  management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk that could potentially have the largest material effect on the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
other types of market risks  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the bank s business activities 
the bank s principal financial objective is to achieve long term profitability while reducing its exposure to fluctuating market interest rates 
the bank has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in market interest rates by attempting to manage the mismatch between asset and liability maturities and interest rates 
the principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s interest earning assets by originating for its portfolio an increasing proportion of loans with interest rates subject to periodic adjustment to market conditions including commercial business  agricultural and consumer loans 
the bank relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds 
management believes retail deposits and in particular core deposits checking and passbook savings accounts  compared to brokered deposits  reduce the effects of interest rate risk 
management s efforts at lowering the bank s interest rate risk have proven successful 
the bank was examined by the ots and received a satisfactory rating 
the bank s primary monitoring tool for assessing interest rate risk is asset liability simulation modeling  which is performed for the bank by the ots 
the modeling process is designed to capture the dynamics of balance sheet  interest rate and spread movements and to quantify variations in net interest income resulting from those movements under different rate environments 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis performed by the ots for the bank incorporates end of period rate  balance and maturity data compiled by the bank s management using various levels of aggregation of that data 
the following table is provided by the ots and sets forth the change in the bank s net portfolio value npv at march   based on ots assumptions  that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates  with no effect given to any steps that management might take to counteract that change 
npv is defined as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present values of net expected cash inflows from existing off balance sheet contracts 
basis points bp estimated change in change in interest rates net portfolio value dollars in thousands bp   n a n a  n a n a  the above table illustrates  for example  that an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates at march  would reduce the bank s npv by approximately million  or at that date 
this compares to a reduction in the bank s npv by approximately million  or at march  certain assumptions utilized by the ots in assessing the interest rate risk of savings associations within its region were utilized in preparing the preceding table 
these assumptions relate to interest rates  loan prepayment rates  deposit decay rates  and the market values of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios  among others 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
the model assumes a parallel change in rates  whereas actual market interest rates would not necessarily react in a parallel manner 
further  call provisions of certain securities  which shorten the actual term to maturity if exercised  are not taken into account in the model 
the following table presents the bank s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  and the instruments fair value at march  market risk sensitive instruments are generally defined as on and off balance sheet derivatives and other financial instruments

while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows  mortgage prepayments and maturing securities  cash flows and anticipated maturities of mortgage backed bonds and agency securities are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure sufficient funds to fund loan originations and deposit withdrawals  to satisfy other financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities 
the bank generally maintains sufficient cash and short term investments to meet short term liquidity needs 
at march  cash and cash equivalents totaled million or of total assets 
the bank also maintained an uncommitted credit facility with the fhlb which provided for immediately available advances up to an aggregate amount of million  under which million in advances were outstanding at march  in addition to the fhlb credit facility  at march  the bank had a million reverse repurchase line of credit available with merrill lynch and a million overnight line of credit with key bank 
the bank s primary investing activity is the origination of one to four family mortgage loans within its primary market area 
during the years ended march   and the bank originated million  million  and million of such loans  respectively 
at march   the bank had commitments to extend credit totaling million 
the bank anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet current loan commitments 
certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from march  totaled million 
historically  the bank has been able to retain a significant amount of its deposits as they mature 
ots regulations require the bank to maintain specific amounts of regulatory capital 
as of march   the bank complied with all regulatory capital requirements as of that date with tangible  core and total capital ratios of  and  respectively 
see regulation federal regulation of savings associations capital requirements and note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein 
effect of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the bank s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
