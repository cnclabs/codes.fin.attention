item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the largest rent to own operator in the united states with an approximate market share based on store count 
at december   we operated  company owned stores in states  the district of columbia and puerto rico 
our subsidiary  colortyme  is a national franchisor of rent to own stores 
at december   colortyme had franchised stores in states  of which operated under the colortyme name and stores of which operated under the rent a center name 
our stores offer high quality durable products such as home electronics  appliances  computers  and furniture and accessories under flexible rental purchase agreements that allow the customer to obtain ownership of the merchandise at the conclusion of an agreed upon rental period 
these rental purchase agreements are designed to appeal to a wide variety of customers by allowing them to obtain merchandise that they might otherwise be unable to obtain due to insufficient cash resources or a lack of access to credit 
these agreements also cater to customers who only have a temporary need  or who simply desire to rent rather than purchase the merchandise 
we have pursued an aggressive growth strategy since we have sought to acquire underperforming stores to which we could apply our operating model as well as open new stores 
as a result  the acquired stores have generally experienced more significant revenue growth during the initial periods following their acquisition than in subsequent periods 
because of significant growth since our formation  particularly due to the thorn americas acquisition  our historical results of operations and period to period comparisons of such results and other financial data  including the rate of earnings growth  may not be meaningful or indicative of future results 
we plan to accomplish our future growth through selective and opportunistic acquisitions  with an emphasis on new store development 
typically  a newly opened store is profitable on a monthly basis in the ninth to twelfth month after its initial opening 
historically  a typical store has achieved cumulative break even profitability in to months after its initial opening 
total financing requirements of a typical new store approximate  with roughly of that amount relating to the purchase of rental merchandise inventory 
a newly opened store historically has achieved results consistent with other stores that have been operating within the system for greater than two years by the end of its third year of operation 
as a result  our quarterly earnings are impacted by how many new stores we opened during a particular quarter and the quarters preceding it 
there can be no assurance that we will open any new stores in the future  or as to the number  location or profitability thereof 
in addition  to provide any additional funds necessary for the continued pursuit of our operating and growth strategies  we may incur from time to time additional short or long term bank indebtedness and may issue  in public or private transactions  equity and debt securities 
the availability and attractiveness of any outside sources of financing will depend on a number of factors  some of which will relate to our financial condition and performance  and some of which are beyond our control  such as prevailing interest rates and general economic conditions 
there can be no assurance additional financing will be available  or if available  will be on terms acceptable to us 
if a change in control occurs  we may be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding senior subordinated notes at of their principal amount  plus accrued interest to the date of repurchase 
our senior credit facilities restrict our ability to repurchase our senior subordinated notes  including in the event of a change in control 
in addition  a change in control would result in an event of default under our senior credit facilities  which could then be accelerated by our lenders  and would require us to offer to redeem our series a preferred stock 
in the event a change in control occurs  we cannot be sure that we would have enough funds to immediately pay our accelerated senior credit facility obligations  all of our senior subordinated notes and for the redemption of our series a preferred stock  or that we would be able to obtain financing to do so on favorable terms  if at all 
forward looking statements the statements  other than statements of historical facts  included in this report are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology  such as may  will  would  expect  intend  could  estimate  should  anticipate or believe 
we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are accurate 
however  we cannot assure you that such expectations will occur 
our actual future performance could differ materially from such statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to uncertainties regarding the ability to open new stores  our ability to acquire additional rent to own stores on favorable terms  our ability to enhance the performance of these acquired stores  our ability to control store level costs and implement our margin enhancement initiatives  our ability to realize benefits from our margin enhancement initiatives  the results of our litigation  the passage of legislation adversely affecting the rent to own industry  interest rates  our ability to collect on our rental purchase agreements  our ability to effectively hedge interest rates on our outstanding debt  changes in our effective tax rate  and the other risks detailed from time to time in our securities and exchange commission reports 
additional factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations are discussed under the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
you should not unduly rely on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
except as required by law  we are not obligated to publicly release any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
critical estimates  uncertainties or assessments in our financial statements the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in applying our accounting principles  we must often make individual estimates and assumptions regarding expected outcomes or uncertainties 
as you might expect  the actual results or outcomes are generally different than the estimated or assumed amounts 
these differences are usually minor and are included in our consolidated financial statements as soon as they are known 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
actual results related to the estimates and assumptions made by us in preparing our consolidated financial statements will emerge over periods of time  such as estimates and assumptions underlying the determination of our self insurance liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are monitored by us and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant 
for instance  our liability for self insurance related to our workers compensation  general liability  medical and auto liability may be adjusted based on higher or lower actual loss experience 
although there is greater risk with respect to the accuracy of these estimates and assumptions because of the period over which actual results may emerge  such risk is mitigated by our ability to make changes to these estimates and assumptions over the same period 
in preparing our financial statements at any point in time  we are also periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within our control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
as discussed in part i  item legal proceedings and the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we are involved in actions relating to claims that our rental purchase agreements constitute installment sales contracts  violate state usury laws or violate other state laws enacted to protect consumers  claims asserting gender discrimination in our employment practices  as well as claims we violated the federal securities laws 
we  together with our counsel  make estimates  if determinable  of our probable liabilities and record such amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
these estimates represent our best estimate  or may be the minimum range of probable loss when no single best estimate is determinable 
disclosure is made  when determinable  of the additional possible amount of loss on these claims  or if such estimate cannot be made  that fact is disclosed 
we  together with our counsel  monitor developments related to these legal matters and  when appropriate  adjustments are made to liabilities to reflect current facts and circumstances 
we periodically review the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
one of the methods used for this review is performed using estimates of future cash flows 
if the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible assets exceeds its fair value 
we believe that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value are reasonable 
changes in estimates of such cash flows and fair value  however  could affect the evaluation 
based on an assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  we believe that our consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective of our company 
we do not suggest that other general risk factors  such as those discussed elsewhere in this report as well as changes in our growth objectives or performance of new or acquired stores  could not adversely impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized below and in note a to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
revenue 
we collect non refundable rental payments and fees in advance  generally on a weekly or monthly basis 
this revenue is recognized over the term of the agreement 
rental purchase agreements generally include a discounted early purchase option 
upon exercise of this option  and upon sale of used merchandise  revenue is recognized as these payments are received 
franchise revenue 
revenue from the sale of rental merchandise is recognized upon shipment of the merchandise to the franchisee 
franchise fee revenue is recognized upon completion of substantially all services and satisfaction of all material conditions required under the terms of the franchise agreement 
depreciation of rental merchandise 
we depreciate our rental merchandise using the income forecasting method 
the income forecasting method of depreciation we use does not consider salvage value and does not allow the depreciation of rental merchandise during periods when it is not generating rental revenue 
the objective of this method of depreciation is to provide for consistent depreciation expense while the merchandise is on rent 
cost of merchandise sold 
cost of merchandise sold represents the book value net of accumulated depreciation of rental merchandise at time of sale 
salaries and other expenses 
salaries and other expenses include all salaries and wages paid to store level employees  together with market managers salaries  travel and occupancy  including any related benefits and taxes  as well as all store level general and administrative expenses and selling  advertising  insurance  occupancy  fixed asset depreciation and other operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include all corporate overhead expenses related to our headquarters such as salaries  taxes and benefits  occupancy  administrative and other operating expenses  as well as regional directors salaries  travel and office expenses 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles consists primarily of the amortization of the excess of purchase price over the fair market value of acquired assets and liabilities 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  goodwill and intangible assets  which revises the accounting for purchased goodwill and intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives acquired after june  will not be amortized 
effective january   all previously recognized goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be subject to amortization 
also  effective january   goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will be tested for impairment annually  and in the event of an impairment indicator

liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities decreased by million to million in from million in this decrease resulted from a decrease in net earnings  an increase in taxes paid or payable as a result of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and an increase in the amount of rental merchandise purchased during as a result of strong consumer demand  offset by increased depreciation of rental merchandise and increases in accrued liabilities primarily related to self insurance liabilities and litigation 
cash used in investing activities increased by million to million in from million in this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the amount of maintenance capital expenditures made in versus  the acquisition of more new store locations in and increases in purchases of property assets related to our store expansion program 
cash provided by financing activities increased by million to million in  compared to net cash used of million in this increase is primarily related to the net proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of our common stock in may  the net proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of our senior subordinated notes in december  as well as an increase in the amount of stock options exercised during as compared to this increase was partially offset by the repurchase of million of our common stock from mr 
talley and debt repayments under our senior credit facilities of approximately million from the proceeds from the may offering  the december offering  and from available cash flow from operations 
liquidity requirements 
our primary liquidity requirements are for debt service  rental merchandise purchases  capital expenditures  litigation and our store expansion program 
our primary sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations  borrowings and sales of debt and equity securities 
in the future  we may incur additional debt  or may issue debt or equity securities to finance our operating and growth strategies 
the availability and attractiveness of any outside sources of financing will depend on a number of factors  some of which relate to our financial condition and performance  and some of which are beyond our control  such as prevailing interest rates and general economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available  or if available  that it will be on terms we find acceptable 
we believe that the cash flow generated from operations  together with amounts available under our senior credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund our debt service requirements  rental merchandise purchases  capital expenditures  litigation and our store expansion intentions during our revolving credit facilities provide us with revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding million  of which million was available at march  at march   we had million in cash 
while our operating cash flow has been strong and we expect this strength to continue  our liquidity could be negatively impacted if we do not remain as profitable as we expect 
rental merchandise purchases 
we purchased million  million and million of rental merchandise during  and  respectively 
during  we made a one time net investment in rental inventory in order to remerchandise the stores acquired in the thorn americas and central rents acquisitions 
capital expenditures 
we make capital expenditures in order to maintain our existing operations as well as for new capital assets in new and acquired stores 
we spent million  million and million on capital expenditures in  and  respectively  and expect to spend approximately million in acquisitions and new store openings 
during  we continued our strategy of increasing our store base through opening new stores  as well as through opportunistic acquisitions 
we spent approximately million on acquiring stores and accounts from competitors for the year ended december  it is our intention to increase the number of stores we operate by an average of approximately per year over the next several years 
the profitability of our stores tends to grow at a slower rate approximately five years from the time we open or acquire them 
as a result  in order for us to show improvements in our profitability  it is important for us to continue to open stores in new locations or acquire underperforming stores on favorable terms 
there can be no assurance we will be able to acquire or open new stores at the rates we expect  or at all 
we cannot assure you the stores we do acquire or open will be profitable at the same levels that our current stores are  or at all 
borrowings 
the table below shows the scheduled maturity dates of our senior debt outstanding at december  year ending december  in thousands thereafter  under our senior credit facilities  we are required to use of the net proceeds from any equity offering to repay our term loans 
in addition  we intend to continue to make prepayments of debt under our senior credit facilities  repurchase some of our outstanding subordinated notes or repurchase our common stock under our common stock repurchase program to the extent we have available cash that is not necessary for store openings or acquisitions 
we cannot  however  assure you that we will have excess cash available for these purposes 
senior credit facilities 
the senior credit facilities are provided by a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions led by jp morgan chase bank  as administrative agent 
at december   we had a total of million outstanding under these facilities  all of which was under our term loans 
at december   we had million of availability under this revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the senior credit facilities bear interest at varying rates equal to to over libor  which was at december  we also have a prime rate option under the facilities  but have not exercised it to date 
at december   the average rate on outstanding senior debt borrowings was 
during  we entered into interest rate protection agreements with two banks  one of which expired in under the terms of the current interest rate protection agreements  the libor rate used to calculate the interest rate charged on million of the outstanding senior term debt has been fixed at an average rate of 
the protection on the million expires in the senior credit facilities are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets  including intellectual property and real property 
the senior credit facilities are also secured by a pledge of the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
the senior credit facilities contain covenants that limit our ability to incur additional debt including subordinated debt in excess of million  excluding the subordinated notes we issued in  repurchase our capital stock and senior subordinated notes  incur liens or other encumbrances  merge  consolidate or sell substantially all our property or business  sell assets  other than inventory  make investments or acquisitions unless we meet financial tests and other requirements  make capital expenditures  or enter into a new line of business 
the senior credit facilities require us to comply with several financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum interest coverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
at december   the maximum leverage ratio was  the minimum interest coverage ratio was  and the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio was on that date  our actual ratios were  and  respectively 
events of default under the senior credit facilities include customary events  such as a cross acceleration provision in the event that we default on other debt 
in addition  an event of default under the senior credit facilities would occur if we undergo a change of control 
this is defined to include the case where apollo ceases to own at least of the amount of our voting stock that they owned on august   or a third party becomes the beneficial owner of or more of our voting stock at a time when certain permitted investors own less than the third party or apollo entities own less than of the voting stock owned by the permitted investors 
we do not have the ability to prevent apollo from selling its stock  and therefore would be subject to an event of default if apollo did so and its sales were not agreed to by the lenders under the senior credit facilities 
this could result in the acceleration of the maturity of our debt under the senior credit facilities  as well as under our subordinated notes through their cross acceleration provision 
senior subordinated notes 
in august  we issued million of senior subordinated notes  maturing on august   under an indenture dated as of august  among us  our subsidiary guarantors and the trustee  which is now the bank of new york  as successor to ibj schroder bank trust company 
in december  we issued an additional million of senior subordinated notes  maturing on august   under a separate indenture dated as of december  among us  our subsidiary guarantors and the bank of new york  as trustee 
although issued pursuant to a separate indenture  the notes have substantially identical terms as the notes  except for certain transfer restrictions and registration rights relating to the notes 
the indenture governing the notes is substantially similar to the indenture which governs the notes  including the restrictive covenants  events of default and change of control and redemption provisions 
the indentures contain covenants that limit our ability to incur additional debt  sell assets or our subsidiaries  grant liens to third parties  pay dividends or repurchase stock  and engage in a merger or sell substantially all of our assets 
events of default under the indentures include customary events  such as a cross acceleration provision in the event that we default in the payment of other debt due at maturity or upon acceleration for default in an amount exceeding million 
we may redeem the notes after august   at our option  in whole or in part 
the subordinated notes also require that upon the occurrence of a change of control as defined in the indenture  the holders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase the notes at a price equal to of the original aggregate principal amount  together with accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of repurchase 
if we did not comply with this repurchase obligation  this would trigger an event of default under our senior credit facilities 
store leases 
we lease space for all of our stores as well as our corporate and regional offices under operating leases expiring at various times through colortyme guarantee 
colortyme is a party to an agreement with textron financial corporation  who provides financing to qualifying franchisees of colortyme 
under this agreement  in the event of default by the franchisee under agreements governing this financing and upon the occurrence of certain events  textron may assign the loans and the collateral securing such loans to colortyme  with colortyme then succeeding to the rights of textron under the debt agreements  including the rights to foreclose on the collateral 
we guarantee the obligations of colortyme under this agreement 
litigation 
in  we recorded an accrual of approximately million for estimated probable losses on litigation assumed in connection with the thorn americas acquisition 
as of december   we have paid approximately million of this accrual in settlement of most of these matters and legal fees 
these settlements were funded primarily from amounts available under our senior credit facilities  including the revolving credit facility and the multidraw facility  as well as from cash flow from operations 
on november   we announced that we reached an agreement in principle for the settlement of the margaret bunch  et al 
v 
rent a center  inc matter pending in federal court in kansas city  missouri  which is subject to court approval 
under the terms of the proposed settlement  while not admitting liability  we would pay an aggregate of million to the agreed upon class  plus plaintiff s attorneys fees as determined by the court and costs to administer the settlement process 
accordingly  to account for the aforementioned costs  as well as our own attorneys fees  we recorded a non recurring charge of million in the third quarter of in early march  we reached an agreement in principle with the plaintiffs attorneys in the wilfong matter pending in st 
louis  missouri and the eeoc to resolve the wilfong suit and an eeoc action in tennessee 
under the terms of the proposed settlement  while not admitting any liability  we would pay an aggregate of million to female employees and certain female applicants who were employed by or applied for employment with us for a period commencing no later than april  through the future date of the notice to the applicable class  plus up to  in settlement administrative costs 
the class members in wilfong include all of the bunch class members 
the million payment includes the million payment discussed in connection with the bunch settlement and attorney fees for class counsel in wilfong 
members of the class who do not wish to participate in the settlement would be given the opportunity to opt out of the settlement 
the proposed settlement contemplates the settlement would be subject to a four year consent decree  which could be extended by the court for an additional one year upon a showing of good cause 
also  under the proposed settlement  we agreed to augment our human resources department and our internal employee complaint procedures  enhance our gender anti discrimination training for all employees  hire a consultant mutually acceptable to the parties for two years to advise us on employment matters  provide certain reports to the eeoc during the period of the consent decree  seek qualified female representation on our board of directors  publicize our desire to recruit  hire and promote qualified women  offer to fill job vacancies within our regional markets with qualified class members who reside in those markets and express an interest in employment by us to the extent of of our job vacancies in such markets over a fifteen month period  and to take certain other steps to improve opportunities for women 
we initiated many of the above programs prior to entering into the proposed settlement 
under the proposed agreement  we have the right to terminate the settlement under certain circumstances  including in the event that more than class members elect to opt out of the settlement 
the proposed settlement contemplates that the bunch case will be dismissed with prejudice once such settlement becomes final 
at the parties request  the court in the bunch case stayed the proceedings in that case  including postponing the fairness hearing previously scheduled for march  we anticipate the memphis federal court will stay the tennessee eeoc action as well 
the terms of the proposed settlement are subject to the parties entering into a definitive settlement agreement and court approval 
while we believe the proposed settlement is fair  we cannot assure you that the settlement will be approved by the court in its present form 
to account for the aforementioned costs  as well as our own attorney s fees  we recorded an additional non recurring charge of million in the fourth quarter of in connection with the wilfong matter for a total non recurring charge of million 
additional settlements or judgments against us on our existing litigation could affect our liquidity 
please refer to note j of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

during  we issued  shares of our series a preferred stock at  per share  resulting in aggregate proceeds of million 
dividends on our series a preferred stock accrue on a quarterly basis  at the rate of per annum  per share  and are currently paid in additional shares of series a preferred stock because of restrictive provisions in our senior credit facilities

economic conditions 
although our performance has not suffered in previous economic downturns  we cannot assure you that demand for our products  particularly in higher price ranges  will not significantly decrease in the event of a prolonged recession 
seasonality 
our revenue mix is moderately seasonal  with the first quarter of each fiscal year generally providing higher merchandise sales than any other quarter during a fiscal year  primarily related to federal income tax refunds 
generally  our customers will more frequently exercise their early purchase option on their existing rental purchase agreements or purchase pre leased merchandise off the showroom floor during the first quarter of each fiscal year 
we expect this trend to continue in future periods 
effect of new accounting pronouncements sfas effective january   we adopted sfas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities 
all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings 
ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings 
the adoption of sfas on january  resulted in a cumulative pre tax increase to other comprehensive income of million  or million after taxes 
as a result of a decline in interest rates for the year ended december   accumulated comprehensive loss at the end of the period was million after taxes

we amortized goodwill and intangible assets recognized prior to july  under our current method through december  beginning january   annual goodwill amortization of approximately million will no longer be recognized 
we intend to complete a transitional impairment test of all intangible assets by march  and a transitional fair value based impairment test of goodwill as of january  by june  impairment losses  if any  resulting from the transitional testing will be recognized in the quarter ended march   as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate sensitivity as of december   we had million in subordinated notes outstanding at a fixed interest rate of and million in term loans outstanding at interest rates indexed to the libor rate 
the subordinated notes mature on august  the fair value of the subordinated notes is estimated based on discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality 
the fair value of the subordinated notes at december  was million  which is million above their carrying value 
unlike the subordinated notes  the million in term loans have variable interest rates indexed to current libor rates 
because the variable rate structure exposes us to the risk of increased interest cost if interest rates rise  in we entered into million in interest rate swap agreements that lock in a libor rate of  thus hedging this risk 
of the million in agreements  million expired in september and the remaining million will expire in given our current capital structure  including our interest rate swap agreements  we have million  or of our total debt  in variable rate debt 
a hypothetical change in the libor rate would affect pre tax earnings by approximately million 
the swap agreements had an aggregate fair value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical change in the libor rate would have affected the fair value of the swaps by approximately million 
market risk market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused by fluctuations in interest rates 
our primary market risk exposure is fluctuations in interest rates 
monitoring and managing this risk is a continual process carried out by the board of directors and senior management 
we manage our market risk based on an ongoing assessment of trends in interest rates and economic developments  giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings 
interest rate risk we hold long term debt with variable interest rates indexed to prime or libor that exposes us to the risk of increased interest costs if interest rates rise 
to reduce the risk related to unfavorable interest rate movements  we have entered into certain interest rate swap contracts on million of debt to pay a fixed rate of
