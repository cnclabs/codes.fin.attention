item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following is management s assessment of certain significant factors affecting the financial condition and operating results of energy group and its subsidiaries over the past three years 
the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contain additional data 
for the twelve months ended december   of energy group s operating revenues were derived from central hudson s electric service  from central hudson s natural gas service  and from unregulated businesses 
competition deregulation holding company restructuring energy group is the holding company parent corporation of central hudson and ch services and its competitive business subsidiaries  as described under the caption subsidiaries of energy group in item energy group s operations are conducted through central hudson and the competitive business subsidiaries 
energy group common stock trades on the new york stock exchange under the symbol chg 
the holding company structure was instituted to permit quick response to changes in the evolving competitive energy industry 
the structure permits the use of financing techniques that are better suited to the particular requirements  characteristics and risks of competitive operations without affecting the capital structure or creditworthiness of energy group s regulated subsidiary  central hudson 
this increases energy group s financial flexibility by allowing it to establish different capital structures for each of its individual lines of business 
refocusing of ch services business plan during  ch services intends to refocus its lines of business by divesting its ch resources subsidiary and also assessing the possible discontinuation of certain activities conducted by its chec subsidiary  namely  cogeneration partnerships  energy efficiency projects and its limited partnership interest in the nth power fund ii 
the divestiture of ch resources is expected to result in a net gain 
energy group is unable to predict the net effect of discontinuing the activities noted above 
the purpose of the steps described above is to discontinue operations which have resulted in lower than expected returns and increase focus on the energy distribution activities carried out through ch services subsidiaries  griffith and scasco 
it is the intent in to continue to expand these two subsidiaries through acquisitions  depending on performance and opportunities available 
competitive opportunities proceeding settlement agreement for a discussion of the agreement approved by the psc in its competitive opportunities proceeding and a discussion of the impact of the agreement on energy group s accounting policies  see the caption competitive opportunities proceeding settlement agreement in note proceeds from sales of principal generating facilities on january   central hudson received cash proceeds of million from the sale of the danskammer plant and its interest in the roseton plant to dynegy 
on november   central hudson received cash proceeds of million as part of the consideration for selling its interest in the nine mile plant to an affiliate of constellation 
additional cash proceeds of million of principal and interest at the rate of under a five year promissory note will be received from constellation 
for information on the proposed disposition of the proceeds from these sales  see note under the caption use of proceeds from sales of principal generating facilities

capital resources and liquidity construction program central hudson as shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows  the cash expenditures related to central hudson s construction program amounted to million in  a million increase from the million expended in cash construction expenditures for are estimated to be million  a decrease of million compared to expenditures 
central hudson s estimates of construction expenditures  internal funds available  mandatory and optional redemption or repurchase of long term securities  and working capital requirements for are set forth in the following table in thousands construction expenditures cash construction expenditures  internal funds available  balance of construction requirements to be financed  dividend to parent energy group  total cash requirements  excluding the equity portion of allowance for funds used during construction afdc  a noncash item 
estimates of construction expenditures are subject to continuous review and adjustment  and actual expenditures may vary from estimates 
these construction expenditures include capitalized overheads and the debt portion of afdc 
it is presently estimated that funds available from internal sources will finance of central hudson s cash construction expenditures in during this same period  total external financing of construction expenditure requirements of central hudson are projected to amount to million 
internal funds available to fund construction expenditures are less than in past years because of the reduction in depreciation which occurred due to the sales of central hudson s interests in the roseton  danskammer and nine mile plants  and the payment of dividends by central hudson to energy group 
following changes to its capital structure through the disbursement of funds described in note  central hudson may issue securities from time to time as needed to fund its working capital requirements and construction budget 
in  central hudson expects to satisfy its external funding requirements  either through short term borrowings or issuances of medium term notes 
capital structure under the terms of the recent order of the psc in central hudson s rate restructuring proceeding more fully described in note under the caption rate proceedings electric and gas  central hudson s common equity ratio will be capped  for purposes of the allowed base return on equity roe  at for the twelve months ending june  and at and  respectively  for the two subsequent twelve month periods 
it is expected that the capital structure of central hudson will allow it to maintain a strong investment grade rating for the next few years 
central hudson s senior debt ratings are a by moody s investors service and a by standard and poor s corporation and fitch  duff phelps credit rating company 
as described under the caption use of proceeds from sales of principal generating facilities in note  a portion of the proceeds from the sales of the roseton  danskammer and nine mile plants was used to redeem a portion of energy group s existing debt  and other redemptions may be considered 
energy group s capital structure is set forth below at the end of  and year end capital structure long term debt short term debt preferred stock common equity central hudson s capital structure is set forth below at the end of  and year end capital structure long term debt short term debt preferred stock common equity ch services capital structure is set forth below at the end of  and year end capital structure long term debt short term debt preferred stock common equity based on stand alone financial statements and includes intercompany balances which are eliminated in consolidation 
financing program of energy group and its subsidiaries energy group s stock purchase plan  which can be either an original issue plan or an open market purchase plan  is currently an open market purchase plan 
in  energy group reestablished a stock repurchase program of up to  shares  however  no repurchases of common stock were made under that program 
the amount of stock to be repurchased in will be determined as conditions warrant 
on june   psc authorization for central hudson s medium term note series c program expired 
central hudson has received authority from the psc to issue up to million of unsecured medium term notes during the three years ending june  central hudson expects to establish a new series d medium term note program in for more information with respect to the financing program in general  see the captions in note and note the competitive business subsidiaries funded their acquisitions in through funds received from energy group after a dividend was paid to energy group by central hudson from a portion of its proceeds from the sales of the fossil generating plants 
short term debt energy group s revolving credit agreement with several commercial banks for borrowing up to million expired on december  energy group has determined that it has sufficient cash reserves to fund its cash requirements and determined not to renew this facility 
consideration to establish a new revolving credit facility will be given as conditions warrant 
as more fully discussed in note  in october   central hudson  pursuant to authority from the psc  entered into a million revolving credit facility to replace its existing million revolving credit facility 
in addition  central hudson maintains confirmed lines of credit totaling million with regional banks 
these agreements give central hudson competitive options to minimize its cost of short term borrowing 
authorization from the psc limits the amount central hudson may have outstanding at any time under all of its short term borrowing arrangements to million in the aggregate  which authorization expires on june  as of december   ch services also has short term lines of credit totaling million 
results of operations the following discussion and analyses include explanations of the significant changes in revenues and expenses when comparing the and results of energy group and when comparing the and results of central hudson to the results of central hudson 
additional information relating to changes between these years is provided in the notes hereto 
earnings earnings per share of energy group s common stock are shown after provision for dividends on preferred stock and are computed on the basis of the average number of common shares outstanding during the year 
the number of shares of such common stock  the earnings per share and the rate of return earned on average common equity are as follows average shares outstanding s    earnings per share basic and diluted 
return earned on common equity per financial statements earnings per share in basic and diluted  when compared to basic and diluted  increased 
per share 
this increase resulted substantially from an increase in central hudson s electric net operating revenues net of cost of fuel  purchased electricity and revenue taxes due primarily to a increase in own territory sales to residential and commercial customers 
this increase in sales for the year results from an increase in the average number of customers and warmer weather during the summer months 
the number of cooling degree days in was higher than and above normal 
the increase in central hudson s net operating revenues was partially offset by a reduction in profits  permitted by the psc to be retained from sales of electricity to other utilities and marketers due to the termination of this regulatory incentive effective in early also contributing to the increase was an increase in central hudson s gas net operating revenues net of the cost of gas and revenue taxes primarily due to an increase in residential and commercial space heating sales  and an increase in the average number of customers 
earnings were also favorably impacted by energy group s favorable annualization effect on of the common stock repurchase program in and due to the recognition of an unrealized gain by energy group on a weather derivative contract 
other items which favorably impacted central hudson s earnings were the net effect of various items including cost of capital  income taxes  and central hudson s operating expenses 
partially offsetting these increases was the net effect on central hudson of regulatory actions in associated with the sales of central hudson s interests in its fossil generating plants and the nine mile plant  such as  reduction in rate base related to these generating plants  the after tax contribution to central hudson s customer benefit fund  described in note under the caption summary of regulatory assets and liabilities customer benefit fund  recognition of tax benefits related to the sale of these plants and recognition of net income for shareholders under a prior regulatory agreement 
also contributing to the decrease was a reduction in earnings from the energy group s unregulated subsidiary  ch services  due primarily to losses incurred by ch resources generating plants resulting from reduced margins attributable to volatile gas prices and lower than expected power prices 
the effect of milder weather also depressed sales of ch services oil distribution subsidiaries 
this reduction in earnings was partially offset by the recording of unrealized gains by ch services related to weather derivative contracts entered into as hedges against variations in heating degree days 
earnings per share in basic and diluted  when compared to basic and diluted  increased 
per share 
this increase resulted substantially from an increase in central hudson s electric net operating revenues net of the cost of fuel  purchased electricity and revenue taxes 
the increase  despite a drop in cooling degree days  was due primarily to increases in electric sales to own territory commercial and industrial customers and an increase in the profits retained from sales of electricity to other utilities and marketers 
commercial sales increased due primarily to an increase in the number of customers while the increase in industrial sales resulted from increased usage by existing customers 
actual cooling degree days in were lower than and lower than normal 
an increase in non recoverable fuel costs related to central hudson s fuel cost incentive partially offset the total increase to electric net revenues 
also contributing to the increase in earnings per share in was an increase in earnings from operations of ch services due primarily to the acquisition of griffith in november and the increase in central hudson s gas net operating revenues net of the cost of gas and revenue taxes  largely due to an overall increase in own territory sales 
increases in residential and commercial gas sales in reflected increased heating sales due to increased heating degree days 
actual heating degree days approximated normal for and were higher than in earnings per share for were also favorably impacted by energy group s common stock repurchase of  shares during the increases in revenues in were partially offset by an increase in operation and maintenance costs incurred by central hudson 
that increase reflected increases in the cost of normal storm restoration efforts  gas site remediation  routine and scheduled generating plant maintenance  maintenance of gas mains and workers compensation insurance 
the increase in workers compensation insurance was due to the elimination of substantial dividends received by central hudson in other items impacting earnings unfavorably were non recurring items  primarily the effect of income recorded in related to the sale of energy group s former new york stock exchange symbol  increased depreciation on central hudson s utility plant and equipment  and  the net effect of various other items  including increases in taxes other than income taxes and the cost of capital 
energy group has established a projection for earnings in calendar year of to per share 
this projected level  which is below the actual level of per share  reflects the expected decrease in earnings of central hudson due to the removal of the roseton  danskammer and nine mile plants from central hudson s rate base 
this decrease in central hudson earnings is expected to be partially offset by increased earnings from ch services 
operating revenues total operating revenues of energy group decreased million in  as compared to  and increased million in  as compared to see the table below for details of the variations increase or decrease from prior year electric gas other total electric gas other total in thousands operating revenues customer sales       sales to other utilities 
      fuel cost adjustment       deferred revenues      miscellaneous   subtotal       competitive business subsidiary sales     total         sales central hudson central hudson s sales vary seasonally in response to weather and electric revenues peak in the summer while gas revenues peak in the winter 
utility sales of electricity within central hudson s service territory  plus delivery of electricity supplied by others  increased in compared to sales to residential and commercial customers increased and  respectively  with sales to industrial customers remaining unchanged 
the increase in sales is due primarily to an increase in the average number of residential and commercial customers and increased usage due to warmer than normal weather 
cooling degree days in were higher than and above normal 
electric sales increased in versus the slight improvement in sales  despite the decrease in the number of cooling degree days  was due primarily to an increase in the average number of customers 
utility sales of firm natural gas within central hudson s service territory  plus transportation of gas supplied by others  decreased by from to  however  sales to residential and commercial customers each increased 
the increase in sales for these higher volume customers results primarily from an increase in the average number of customers 
industrial sales decreased and interruptible sales decreased as compared to last year due to a decrease in usage 
sales of firm natural gas increased from to  resulting  in part  from a increase in heating degree days due to colder weather experienced in changes in sales from the prior year by major customer classification  including interruptible gas sales are set forth below 
also included are the changes related to energy delivery service 
increase decrease from prior year electric mwh gas mcf residential commercial industrial interruptible n a n a due to sharing arrangements that are in place for interruptible gas sales and interruptible transportation of customer owned gas  as described in the caption incentive arrangements below  variations in these sales from year to year typically have a minimal impact on earnings 
incentive arrangements under certain incentive formulas approved by the psc  central hudson either shares with its customers certain revenues and or cost savings exceeding defined predetermined levels  or is penalized in some cases for shortfalls from the targeted levels or defined performance standards 
incentive formulas were in place for fuel cost variations and sales of electricity to other utilities through december incentive formulas continue in place for interruptible gas sales  gas capacity release transactions and customer satisfaction  electric reliability and keeping customer appointments 
see note under the caption rate proceedings electric and gas for a description of new equity incentive and sharing formulas for central hudson approved by the psc 
the net results of these incentive formulas were to increase pretax earnings by 
million  million and million during  and  respectively 
sales and revenues ch services revenues for ch services increased million  from million in to million in of the revenue increase in  revenues from griffith increased million from million in to million in  primarily due to the full year of ownership of griffith  revenues from scasco increased million  from million in to million in primarily due to a growth in sales resulting from additional acquisitions 
sales of wholesale energy of all three of ch resources generating plants operations during decreased by million  from million in due to reduced wholesale electric prices in new york state 
revenues for ch services increased million from to of the revenue increase in  revenues from scasco increased million primarily due to a growth in sales from additional acquisitions 
sales of wholesale energy of all three of ch resources generating plants operation during increased by million 
also included in the revenues are million of revenues from griffith  which was acquired in november operating expenses the most significant elements of operating expenses are purchased electricity in central hudson s electric department and purchased natural gas in central hudson s gas department 
approximately in and in of every revenue dollar billed by central hudson s electric department was expended for the combined cost of fuel used in electric generation and purchased electricity 
the corresponding figures in central hudson s gas department for the cost of purchased gas were and  respectively 
in an effort to keep the cost of electricity at the lowest reasonable level  central hudson has negotiated multi year purchased energy contracts energy contracts with the new owners of the fossil and nuclear plants it divested in these purchases are supplemented by purchases from the nys iso 
for information regarding the energy contracts  see item under the subcaption load and capacity  note under the caption sales of principal generating facilities and note total central hudson utility operating expenses decreased million from to the reduction in these expenses largely reflects the effect of the sale of central hudson s interests in its fossil plants and in the nine mile plant 
fuel and purchased electricity for central hudson increased  in compared to due to an increase in sales to full service residential and commercial customers 
in  central hudson s utility fuel and purchased electricity increased million due to the increase in electric sales  as well as sales of electricity for resale 
the rise in costs reflected increasing fossil fuel prices and also the impact of changing market conditions brought about by the formation of the nys iso in november during central hudson purchased natural gas costs remained almost flat with a decrease of   reflecting a reduction in the volume purchased and lower natural gas prices 
in  utility purchased natural gas costs increased million due to higher firm and interruptible gas sales  including the use of natural gas as a boiler fuel 
all other expenses of central hudson s utility operation decreased million due to a reduction in depreciation and amortization  and taxes and other expenses resulting from the elimination of all operating costs associated with the fossil generating plants that were sold and the reduction in depreciation expense for central hudson s share of the nine mile plant  the remaining cost of which was recovered using sale proceeds 
ch services operating expenses increased million from million in to million in  primarily due to fuel costs associated with ch resources generating plants and the cost of petroleum and natural gas for scasco and griffith 
fuel costs for ch resources decreased million  from million in  to million in due to decreased generation 
petroleum and natural gas costs increased by million  from million in to million in  due primarily to the full year of ownership of griffith 
ch services other expenses of operation  excluding energy supply costs  increased million  including a million increase in depreciation and amortization on related assets 
the primary reasons for both the increase in energy supply costs and the increase in other expenses of operation are the full year ownership of griffith  acquired in november  and the additional acquisitions in in  fuel costs for ch resources increased million and petroleum and natural gas costs for scasco and griffith increased million 
all other expenses increased million in  due to the continued growth of ch services through acquisitions 
see note for an analysis and reconciliation of federal and state income taxes 
other income and interest charges energy group s other income and deductions increased million in as compared to resulting largely from the recognition of tax benefits related to the sales of central hudson s interests in its fossil fueled and nuclear generating plants and the restoration of net income for central hudson shareholders under a prior regulatory agreement 
the increase also reflects the recognition of unrealized gains related to weather derivative contracts entered into by energy group 
other income and deductions for energy group in decreased million compared to  primarily due to the non operating income reported in from the sale of energy group s former new york stock exchange symbol 
total central hudson interest charges excluding afdc decreased million in primarily due to central hudson s redemption and repurchase of a number of its long term debt obligations 
this debt was eliminated using a portion of the proceeds from the sale of central hudson s interests in the fossil generating plants 
partially offsetting the decrease in interest charges are central hudson s carrying charges related to a number of regulatory obligations including the customer benefit fund established in the electric rate proceeding concluded in october and referred to in note under the caption rate proceedings electric and gas 
in  central hudson s interest charges increased million in because of an increase in financing activity

significant changes consolidated balance sheets the sales of central hudson s interests in its fossil generating plants and the nine mile plant and regulatory actions related to the rate proceedings concluded in october are described in note under the captions sales of principal generating facilities and rate proceedings electric and gas  respectively 
these actions resulted in significant changes with certain line item balances  as compared to the balances at december   in energy group s and central hudson s balance sheets 
the sales of these interests reduced net utility plant  increased cash and cash equivalents  reduced long term debt due to the utilization of sale proceeds to redeem or repurchase a number of securities of central hudson and increased the regulatory liabilities balance due to the establishment of the customer benefit fund with largely sale proceeds 
in addition  central hudson s retained earnings balance was significantly reduced by the dividend paid and for additional unregulated investments to its parent  energy group  to meet tax obligations related to these sales 
the balance in regulatory assets was reduced  in large measure  by the recovery of a number of balances at june  by offsetting them against regulatory liabilities balances  as authorized in the rate proceedings

central hudson only 
the effective tax rate for consists of a effective rate for federal income taxes and a effective rate for state income taxes 
the negative effective tax rate in is primarily due to the recognition of investment tax credits in the amount of million upon the sale of central hudson s interests in its fossil and nuclear plants and million of tax exempt interest 
the effective tax rate for consisted of a rate for federal income taxes and a effective rate for state income taxes 
the effective tax rates for prior years are solely the effective tax rates for federal income tax 
prior to the year when the new york state law was changed  central hudson and other new york state utilities were not subject to an income based state tax 
common stock dividends and price ranges energy group and central hudson and its principal predecessors have paid dividends on common stock in each year commencing in  which common stock has been listed on the new york stock exchange since the price ranges and the dividends paid for each quarterly period during the last two fiscal years are as follows high low dividend high low dividend st quarter 

nd quarter

in  energy group maintained the quarterly dividend rate at 
per share 
in making future dividend decisions  energy group will evaluate all circumstances at the time of making such decisions  including business  financial and regulatory considerations 
the agreement contains certain dividend payment restrictions on central hudson  including limitations on the amount of dividends payable if central hudson s senior debt ratings were downgraded by more than one rating agency due to performance  or concerns about the financial condition of energy group or any energy group subsidiary other than central hudson 
these limitations would result in a reduction of the average annual income available for dividends on a two year rolling average basis as follows i  if the downgrade were below bbb  ii if the senior debt were placed on credit watch or the equivalent because of a rating below bbb  or iii no dividends payable if the downgrade were below bbb 
these restrictions survived the june  expiration of the agreement 
the number of registered holders of common stock of energy group as of december   was  of these   were accounts in the names of individuals with total holdings of  shares  or an average of shares per account 
the other accounts  in the names of institutional or other non individual holders  for the most part  hold shares of common stock for the benefit of individuals 
all of the outstanding common stock of central hudson and ch services are held by energy group 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary market risks for energy group and its subsidiaries are commodity price risk and interest rate risk 
exposure to commodity price risk related to purchases and or sales of natural gas  power supplies and petroleum products is mitigated in several different ways 
depending on market conditions  central hudson and ch services enter into long term fixed supply and long term forward supply contracts for the purchase and or sale of these commodities 
central hudson also uses gas storage facilities to purchase blocks of natural gas at pre heating season prices for use during the heating season 
both central hudson and ch services also enter into derivative transactions to hedge market price fluctuations 
energy group and central hudson have in place a common energy risk management program with the primary goal to further manage  through the use of defined risk management practices  price and volume risks associated with commodity purchases in its operations 
the written policy and procedures for this program permit the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge price risk 
both central hudson and ch services have entered into either exchange traded futures contracts or over the counter contracts with third parties to hedge commodity price risk associated with the purchase and or sale of natural gas  electricity and petroleum products 
central hudson has entered into derivative contracts to hedge a portion of its total gas supply requirements and the purchase of electricity 
the fair value of open positions at december  was million and a total of million in realized net gains was recorded in these realized gains served to offset the differences between the expected price of the commodity and the actual price 
central hudson s exposure to commodity price risk related to its purchases of natural gas  fuel for electric generation  and other power purchases is also mitigated by its electric and gas cost adjustment clauses 
these adjustment clauses provide for the collection of costs  including risk management costs  from customers to reflect the actual costs incurred in obtaining supply 
risk management costs are defined by the psc as costs associated with transactions that are intended to reduce price volatility or reduce overall costs to customers 
these costs include transaction costs  and gains and losses associated with other risk management instruments 
central hudson manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of fixed rate debt with varying maturities and variable rate debt for which interest is reset on a periodic basis reflecting current market conditions 
the difference between costs associated with actual variable interest rates related to central hudson s bonds issued by the new york state energy research development authority nyserda and costs embedded in customer rates is deferred for eventual passback to  or recovery from  customers 
central hudson also repurchases or redeems existing debt at a lower cost when economical 
ch services has entered into derivative transactions to hedge the purchase and sale of electricity and the purchase of natural gas and heating oil 
open positions at december  reflected a fair value of  and an actual realized gain totaling million was recorded in for settled derivatives which served to offset the change in the difference between the expected price of the commodity sold or purchased and the actual price 
in order to hedge sales volume risk  energy group and certain of its subsidiaries entered into weather derivative contracts known as costless collars to economically hedge the effect on earnings due to significant variations in weather conditions from normal patterns and to reduce exposure to variations in heating degree days in the november  through march  period 
unrealized gains totaling million were recorded in because the weather collar has a deadband  if weather patterns approximate normal for the remaining months of the weather contract  estimated losses would be recorded each month and likely result in realized gains less than the million 
in accordance with the approved guidelines set forth in energy group s and central hudson s risk management policy and procedures  over the counter otc derivative transactions are entered into only with counter parties that meet certain approved credit criteria 
the creditworthiness of these counter parties is determined primarily by reference to published credit ratings 
at december   ch services subsidiary  scasco  had open otc put option positions extending through april  with counter parties covering approximately of the anticipated oil supply requirements for the period january through april scasco generally enters into oil put derivative contracts to hedge firm oil purchase commitments covering approximately of its total forecasted requirements 
at december   central hudson had one open otc derivative contract to hedge natural gas basis risk in  which represents less than of central hudson s projected total natural gas requirements 
in  otc transactions were used to hedge of central hudson s total natural gas supply requirements 
in its electric operations  central hudson had open otc derivatives at december  to hedge a portion of its required power supply through october in  central hudson hedged approximately of its total power supply requirements with otc derivative contracts 
the notional amounts hedged for  and represent approximately  and  respectively  of the forecasted total power supply requirements for each of those years 
derivative contracts are discussed in more detail in note under the caption accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities
