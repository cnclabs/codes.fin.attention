fiscal year ended june  compared to june  net sales of million for the fiscal year ended june  were down from million in fiscal a reduction in the number of units shipped and a decrease in the average selling price per unit were the main contributors to the sales decline between years 
a increase in accessory sales in the current year partially offset the reduced sales volume and lower average selling prices on the company s monitors and related equipment 
international sales in fiscal to criticare s distributors in the united kingdom uk and china decreased from the prior year and contributed over million to the company s sales decrease between years 
significant cutbacks in health care spending in the uk  where only critically important capital expenditures are being made  have negatively impacted the company s sales to its distributor in the uk in fiscal the transition to a new distributor in china in fiscal is expected to provide long term sales growth opportunities for the company  but in the short term has resulted in reduced sales in fiscal as this change was implemented 
see forward looking statements 
domestic sales in fiscal were down  from the prior year  but this was partially offset by higher sales to domestic oem customers that were up  in fiscal the decrease in domestic sales can be attributed to the poor us economy in fiscal and the events of september th  which basically eliminated sales from one of the company s largest domestic trade shows that was held that week 
oem sales in fiscal increased for the third consecutive year and represented of total company sales in fiscal  consistent with the company s strategy to increase this segment of its business 
the gross profit percentage of realized in fiscal was down from in fiscal higher manufacturing costs in the first six months of the current fiscal year to support the company s efforts to transition its manufacturing offshore by the end of calendar year and the lower sales volume between years resulted in an under utilization of fixed manufacturing costs which contributed to reduced margins in fiscal due to the outsourcing of the majority of the company s products  approximately  of fixed costs that had previously been classified as manufacturing expenses were included in administrative expenses in the current year 
the favorable impact of this change on margins was offset by a  increase in the reserve for obsolete inventory that was deemed necessary due to continued high levels of component parts being maintained by the company after outsourcing the majority of its manufacturing 
total operating expenses in fiscal were  lower than the prior year  despite a  increase in administrative expenses  due mainly to a  reduction in marketing expenses in fiscal as noted above  the higher administrative expenses were mainly driven by a change in the classification of expenses due to a change in the operations of the business 
certain fixed costs that had been expensed as manufacturing costs in prior years were more appropriately classified as administrative expenses in fiscal the decrease in marketing expenses was due mostly to a reduction in sales commissions and bonuses earned from lower sales in fiscal in addition  the elimination of a sales vice president position in the fourth quarter of the prior year resulted in a reduction in marketing salaries and fringe benefits in fiscal in addition to the lower sales and reduction in gross profit in fiscal  a  increase in other expenses in fiscal  due mostly to the recognition of a  foreign currency exchange loss related to the company s operation in india  contributed to the  loss in fiscal fiscal year ended june  compared to june  net sales for the fiscal year ended june  increased from the prior year 
however  two significant and isolated sales in the prior year  combined with the partial return of product from one of these sales in the current year  had the effect of increasing prior year revenue and reducing current year revenue 
adjusting for these items  the net sales in fiscal increased over million  or  above the prior year 
approximately million of this increase can be attributed to higher oem sales  which grew from the prior year on a increase in the number of units shipped 
oem business has become a significant distribution channel in fiscal higher replacement part shipments contributed another  to the sales increase between years 
the gross profit percentage of realized in fiscal improved from the generated in fiscal margins in fiscal were favorably impacted by the recognition of  in deferred income from the settlement of a contract that was agreed to in january and fully satisfied in the third quarter of fiscal in addition  a warranty reserve was reduced by  due to favorable warranty experience on extended warranty contracts sold to customers  and a reserve for obsolete inventory was decreased by  these adjustments increased margins approximately percentage point in fiscal total operating expenses were  lower in fiscal than the prior year  of which million of this reduction was due to a decrease in bad debt expense between years 
marketing expenses in fiscal included bad debt expense of million  including a specific charge of  in the fourth quarter related to the receivable balances of certain international customers that were deemed to be uncollectible during the fourth quarter 
marketing expenses in fiscal included a  recovery of a portion of the bad debt expense recognized in the fourth quarter of the prior year from the repossession of inventory sold  and more than offset the bad debt provision provided in fiscal excluding the million impact on bad debt expense between years  marketing expenses were still down  in fiscal  due mainly to more cost effective spending on travel and trade shows 
in addition to the reduction in marketing expenses  engineering project expenses were reduced nearly  in fiscal  due to significant spending incurred in fiscal related to the development of the product that was released in late fiscal the reduction in marketing and engineering expenses more than offset the  increase in administrative expenses related mostly to the termination and replacement of a senior manager in fiscal the overall  reduction in operating expenses in fiscal  combined with slightly higher revenue and improved margins compared to the prior year  resulted in an  loss from operations  which represented a significant improvement from the  operating loss generated in fiscal other income and expense in fiscal is comparable to that of the prior year with the exception of the million gain recorded in fiscal this gain related to the private placement sale of a portion of the company s stock investment in immtech international  inc  in which the company still has a position 
the large gain allowed the company to offset the majority of the operating loss produced in fiscal  resulting in a net loss of  that was  greater than the  loss generated in fiscal critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  sales returns  inventories and warranty obligations 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following accounting policies require its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues and the costs of products sold are recognized as the related products are shipped or installed  if there are significant installation costs 
this revenue recognition policy is utilized for shipment of product to customers including both distributors and end users 
estimating allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
management analyzes specific accounts receivable as well as historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  foreign currency movements and changes in its customer payment terms when evaluating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of one of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of its ability to make payments to the company  additional allowances may be required 
the company also maintains a sales returns reserve in order to estimate potential future product returns related to current period revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demand and acceptances of the company s products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns reserve 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns reserve in any accounting period 
material differences between actual sales returns experience and management s estimates may affect the company s revenue in subsequent periods 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on the first in  first out method 
the company maintains a reserve for obsolete inventory that it utilizes to write down inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the carrying value of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product demand and market conditions 
if future product demand is lower than expected or if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the company  additional charges to the obsolescence reserve may be required 
during fiscal  the reserve for obsolete inventory was increased by  to  at june  due to continued high levels of component parts being maintained by the company after outsourcing the majority of its manufacturing 
product warranty the company reserves for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time products are shipped based upon its historical experience providing warranty coverage 
the company s warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from current projections  revisions to the estimated warranty reserve would be required

subsequent event on august   in part due to the new regulations imposed under the sarbanes oxley act  the company initiated an internal review of its import and export procedures 
on august   senior management of the company became aware of actions that may have violated united states import export laws and regulations 
senior management of the company immediately authorized an internal audit of these possible violations  focusing on the sale of medical equipment directly or indirectly into an embargoed country and possible marking issues 
this internal audit is ongoing and  at this time  management is unable to determine with certainty the extent of any violations or the potential for the imposition of penalties 
the import and export rules applicable to all united states companies engaged in international business transactions contain compliance guidelines 
violations may result in civil or criminal penalties  or both  as well as the potential loss of export privileges 
the company has taken action to adopt and implement a written compliance program with respect to applicable import export rules 
the company has also undertaken a voluntary disclosure with the bureau of industry and security bis and the treasury s office of foreign asset control ofac 
although there is no assurance  based upon a review of the internal audit to date and precedents  the company believes a negotiated settlement of any violations will not have a material adverse effect on the operations of the company 
at this time  the company cannot determine whether any monetary fines would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition 
the company does not believe that the evidence supports the denial of export privileges  however  any such penalty would have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company further believes that the voluntary disclosure to the bis  ofac and  possibly  other agencies will serve to mitigate any potential adverse consequences that otherwise might accrue
