the merger was designed to achieve certain economies related to costs  to eliminate redundant systems and services  to take advantage of the growing recognition of the lml brand name and to coordinate our approach to the marketing of our payment services 
the corporate acquisitions that were completed by us over the past three years have made our results of operations not directly comparable year over year due to a full months of operation results not being included in prior fiscal years  as well as the increase in amortization for all the corporate acquisitions 
the corporate acquisitions of cfdc holdings corp 
and national recovery systems  ltd 
of america d b a check center  which were completed in fiscal year  were not included in our results of operations until december and january  respectively 
the acquisition of phoenix eps inc and check technologies inc  which were completed in fiscal year  were not included in our results of operations until july in a separate business segment  we own and manage a acre manufactured home retirement property known as wildwood estates  in wildwood  florida 
operations have included the sale of manufactured homes and lots 
in exchange for monthly maintenance fees  we provide the resident community with certain amenities and services commonly associated with similar developments 
we presently have the entire property listed for sale at million and are exploring other options regarding its disposition

during the year ended march  one of our largest customers  accounting for of our total revenue in fiscal year  notified us of its intention to perform its check authorization services in house 
authorization transactions started being transferred over in february and were completed by the end of our second quarter of fiscal year this customer also moved its primary check collections in house 
we are continuing to provide secondary check collection services to this customer and expanded this service to include volume from a portion of the customer s affiliated companies 
the transfer of these services in house by this customer may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we expect to continue to provide secondary check collection services to this customer 
for the year ended march   this customer accounted for of our total revenue 
total revenues for fiscal year were approximately million  a decrease over revenues of million for fiscal year this decrease is primarily the result of our plan to move away from licensing our retail electronic payment system software directly to clients and implementing a centralized data center processing which operates our retail electronic payment system and provides clients with transaction based services rather than software licenses 
although this has caused a short term decrease in revenue  it is expected to increase revenue in the long term 
licensing revenue and consulting fees decreased approximately  for fiscal year in the rd quarter of fiscal year  we began to recover paper returned items electronically for clients

for fiscal year  costs of operations as a percentage of sales increased to compared to for fiscal year beginning near the end of the nd quarter of fiscal year  we began to initiate electronic check re presentment on behalf of many of our clients for whom we had been performing traditional collection services 
the implementation of the more cost effi cient electronic check re presentment methods from our data center resulted in a reduction of costs of operations primarily in the rd and th quarters of fiscal year financial payment processing costs of operations were approximately million in the st quarter  million in the nd quarter  million in the rd quarter and million in the th quarter 
we continue to seek ways to reduce costs of operations

while maintaining a similar level of business  we were able to initiate a reduction in staffing levels and related costs in late september  we experienced ebitda losses of approximately  in the st quarter  million in the nd quarter   in the rd quarter and we had a positive ebitda of  in the th quarter of fiscal year interest interest expense decreased to approximately  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year this decrease was due to the decrease in long term debt

income taxes we regularly evaluate the realizability of our future tax assets given the nature of our operations and given the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
we consider it more likely than not that the future tax assets will not be realized through future taxable income 
accordingly  the future tax asset is reserved in full as of march  net loss net loss increased to approximately million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase in our net loss is due primarily to amortization of intangibles  depreciation of capital assets and increased costs associated with the acquisitions 
loss per both basic and diluted shares was approximately in fiscal year  as compared to for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources our liquidity and financial position consisted of approximately million in working capital as of march  compared to million in working capital as of march  the decrease in working capital was primarily related to normal operating activities and the development of our data center  a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of approximately  and a decrease in accounts receivable to  as of march  from  at march  cash flows used in operations were approximately million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year cash used in investing activities was approximately  for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year expenditures during fiscal year consisted mainly of capital asset expenditures 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately  for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the decrease in cash provide d by financing activities is primarily due to the exercise of options of our common stock that were completed in fiscal year we believe that existing cash and cash equivalent balances  and potential cash flows from operations should satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements in the foreseeable future 
however  any material acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies  other arrangements  unexpected losses  or a further economic slowdown in the retail industry could require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board issued the accounting rules governing business combinations  goodwill and intangible assets 
these rules are statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the canadian institute of chartered accountants issued handbook section  business combinations and handbook section  goodwill and other intangible assets  which are similar to statements and with the adoption of statement and section  goodwill will be no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
rather  goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test at the reporting units level 
impairment loss would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value 
under the new rules  an acquired intangible asset should be separately recognized if the benefit o f the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  regardless of the acquirer s intent to do so 
determining the useful lives of intangible assets will require considerable judgment and fact based analysis 
we plan to adopt the provisions of this standard in fiscal year  beginning april  upon its adoption  we plan to conform its accounting policy to the requirement in this standard 
we believe this standard will have a material non cash impact on our financial statements  as it will not allow for amortization of goodwill  which currently approximates  annually 
at this time we have not determined how goodwill will be allocated to specific reporting units as of april   as we are in the process of evaluating our reporting units 
accordingly  we have not made a determination about whether or not an impairment charge will be necessary upon adoption of the new standard

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in marketable securities which consist of money market and commercial paper 
at march   our marketable securities were recorded at a fair value of approximately million  with an overall weighted average return of and an overall weighted average life of less than three months 
our marketable securities have exposure to price risk  which is estimated as the potential loss in fair value due to a hypothetical change of basis points of our overall average return on marketable securities in quoted market prices 
this hypothetical change would have an immaterial effect on the recorded value of the marketable securities 
we are not exposed to material future earnings or cash flow fluctuations from changes in interest rates on long term debt since of our long term debt is at a fixed rate as of march  the fair value of our debt approximates its carrying value 
to date  we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and are currently not evaluating the future use of any such financial instruments 
we have immaterial exposure to foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
to date  we have not entered into any derivative financial instrument to manage foreign currency risk and are currently not evaluating the future use of any such financial instruments
