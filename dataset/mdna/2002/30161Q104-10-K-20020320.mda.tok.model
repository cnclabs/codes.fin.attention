you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods 
overview we believe that we are a leader in the discovery and validation of high quality novel targets for several major human diseases  and a leader in the discovery of potential new drug therapies  specifically for cancer and other proliferative diseases 
our primary mission is to develop proprietary human therapeutics by leveraging our integrated discovery platform to increase the speed  efficiency and quality of pharmaceutical product discovery and development 
through our expertise in comparative genomics and model system genetics  we are able to find new drug targets that we believe would be difficult or impossible to uncover using other experimental approaches 
our research is designed to identify novel genes and proteins expressed by those genes that  when changed  either decrease or increase the activity in a specific disease pathway in a therapeutically relevant manner 
these genes and proteins represent either potential product targets or drugs that may treat disease or prevent disease initiation or progression 
our most advanced proprietary pharmaceutical program focuses on drug discovery and development of small molecules in cancer 
specifically  the remarkable evolutionary conservation of the biochemical pathways strongly supports the use of simple model systems  such as fruit flies  nematode worms  zebrafish and mice  to identify key components of critical cancer pathways that can then be targeted for drug discovery 
we expect to develop new cancer drugs by exploiting the underlying genetic liabilities of tumor cells to provide specificity in targeting these cells for destruction  while leaving normal cells unharmed 
we have discovered and are further developing a number of small molecule drug targets in addition to monoclonal antibody drug targets 
molecules directed against these targets may selectively kill cancer cells while leaving normal cells unharmed  and may provide alternatives to current cancer therapies 
we believe that our proprietary technologies are also valuable to other industries whose products can be enhanced by an understanding of dna or proteins  including the agrochemical  agricultural and diagnostic industries 
many of these industries have shorter product development cycles and lower risk than the pharmaceutical industry  while at the same time generating significant sales with attractive profit margins 
by partnering with companies in multiple industries  we believe that we are able to diversify our business risk  while at the same time maximizing our future revenue stream opportunities 
our strategy is to establish collaborations with major pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agrochemical companies based on the strength of our technologies and biological expertise as well as to support additional development of our proprietary products 
through these collaborations  we obtain license fees and research funding  together with the opportunity to receive milestone payments and royalties from research results and subsequent product development 
in addition  many of our collaborations have been structured strategically to provide us access to technology to advance our internal programs  saving both time and money  while at the same time retaining rights to use the same information in different industries 
our collaborations with leading companies in the agrochemical industries allow us to continue to expand our internal development capabilities while providing our partners with novel targets and assays 
since we believe that agrochemical products have reduced development time and lower risk  we expect to be able to maximize our potential future revenue stream through partnering in multiple industries 
we have active commercial collaborations with several leading pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agrochemical companies aventis cropscience llc  bayer corporation  bristol myers squibb company two collaborations  cytokinetics  inc  dow agrosciences llc  elan pharmaceuticals  inc  protein design labs  inc  scios inc 
and schering plough research institute  inc 
in addition to our commercial collaborations  we have relationships with other biotechnology companies  academic institutions and universities that provide us access to specific technology or intellectual property for the enhancement of our business 
these include collaborations with leading biotechnology product developers and solutions providers  among them affymetrix inc  genemachines  avi biopharma  inc  silicon genetics  galapagos nv  genomics collaborative inc and accelrys  inc we have also used acquisitions to strategically position and advance our leadership as a genomics based drug discovery company 
in may  we acquired artemis pharmaceuticals gmbh  a privately held genetics and functional genomics company  in a stock for stock transaction valued at approximately million 
located in cologne and tubingen  germany  artemis is focused on the use of vertebrate model genetic systems such as mice and zebrafish as tools for target identification and validation 
we co founded artemis in to expand our access to vertebrate model system technologies 
the two companies have worked closely together since that time  and the acquisition creates a single  worldwide drug discovery company with a broad array of biological systems and other tools for rapid target identification and validation 
this acquisition is a continuation of our strategy to optimize all aspects of the drug discovery process from target identification to clinical development 
in december  we acquired genomica corporation  a publicly traded bioinformatics company  in a stock for stock transaction valued at million 
the transaction was structured as a tender offer for of genomica s outstanding common stock to be followed by a merger of genomica with a wholly owned subsidiary of exelixis 
the exchange offer was closed on december  and the subsequent merger completing the transaction occurred on january  we believe that genomica s substantial cash and investments will significantly enhance our ability to move our drug discovery programs forward and their software may be a useful tool over the next several years that may be used to manage human data obtained during the clinical development of our compounds 
we have a history of operating losses resulting principally from costs associated with research and development activities  investment in core technologies and general and administrative functions 
as a result of planned expenditures for future research and development activities  including manufacturing and clinical development expenses for compounds in clinical studies  we expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future 
acquisition of genomica corporation on november   exelixis and genomica corporation announced a definitive agreement whereby we would acquire genomica in a stock for stock transaction valued at million 
the transaction was structured as an offer for of genomica s outstanding common stock to be followed by a merger of genomica with a wholly owned subsidiary of exelixis 
the offer commenced on november  and closed on december  on december   we accepted for payment  shares of genomica common stock  or of the total number of outstanding shares of common stock of genomica 
on january   the acquisition of genomica was completed 
upon the effectiveness of the merger  genomica became our wholly owned subsidiary 
the transaction  which was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  was effected through the exchange of of a share of our common stock for each outstanding share of genomica common stock 
a total of approximately million shares of our common stock were issued for all of the outstanding shares of genomica common stock 
the purchase price for genomica  which for financial accounting purposes was valued at million  was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition  as determined by management based on an independent valuation 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded net tangible assets of million  developed technology of million  which will be amortized over two years  and goodwill of million 
at the same time  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million  which was expensed in the current year to operations 
the impairment was calculated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas by estimating the present value of future cash flows for the ongoing genomica licensing business using a risk adjusted discount rate 
the impaired goodwill represents excess purchase price which we view as economically equivalent to financing costs for the acquired cash and investments 
we plan to use the cash and investments acquired to fund our research and development programs 
we also gained access to complementary technology that may be useful in supporting our clinical development efforts 
under sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we will apply the new rules of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of accordingly  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with sfas acquisition of artemis pharmaceuticals in may  we acquired a majority of the outstanding capital stock of artemis pharmaceuticals gmbh  a privately held genetics and functional genomics company organized under the laws of germany 
the transaction  which was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  was effected through the exchange of shares of our common stock for deutschmark of nominal value of artemis capital stock  using an exchange ratio of to one 
approximately million shares of our common stock were issued in exchange for of the outstanding capital stock of artemis held by artemis stockholders 
in addition  we received a call option the call option from  and issued a put option the put option to  certain stockholders of artemis the option holders for the issuance of approximately  shares of our common stock in exchange for the remaining of the outstanding capital stock of artemis held by the option holders 
we may exercise the call option at any time from may  through january   and the option holders may exercise their rights under the put option at any time from april  through may  we exercised the call option on  and  shares in december and january  respectively  which resulted in an increase to goodwill of approximately and million  respectively 
in addition  we issued fully vested rights to purchase approximately  additional shares of our common stock to artemis employees in exchange for such employees vested options formerly representing the right to purchase shares of artemis capital stock pursuant to the artemis employee phantom stock option program 
artemis provides us with technologies related to the following two species zebrafish and mice 
these technologies will be used in our research and development efforts 
the purchase price for artemis  which for financial accounting purposes was valued at million  was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition  as determined by management based upon an independent valuation 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded expense associated with the purchase of in process research and development of million  net tangible assets of million and intangible assets including goodwill of million  the majority of which was being amortized over years until december  under sfas  we will apply the new rules of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of accordingly  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with sfas acquisition of exelixis plant sciences formerly agritope in december  we completed our acquisition of agritope  inc as a result of the acquisition  agritope became our wholly owned subsidiary  and we subsequently changed its name to exelixis plant sciences  inc the transaction  which was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  was effected through the exchange of of a share of our common stock for each outstanding share of agritope capital stock 
approximately million shares of our common stock were issued in connection with the transaction 
in addition  unexpired and unexercised options and warrants to purchase shares of agritope capital stock were assumed by us pursuant to the transaction and converted into fully vested options and warrants to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock 
the purchase price for agritope  which for financial accounting purposes was valued at million  was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition  as determined by an independent valuation 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded expense associated with the purchase of in process research and development of million  net tangible liabilities of million  and intangible assets including goodwill of million  the majority of which was being amortized over years until december  under sfas  we will apply the new rules of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of accordingly  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with sfas through our subsidiary  we develop improved plant products and traits and provide technology for the agricultural industry 
we acquired vinifera  inc vinifera in connection with the purchase of agritope parent company of vinifera 
vinifera was organized as a majority owned subsidiary and was engaged in the grape vine propagation business 
because this business did not fit our strategic objectives  at the date of the acquisition of agritope  we committed to a plan to sell the vinifera operations 
on march   we reduced our ownership interest in vinifera from to by selling million shares of vinifera common stock back to vinifera in consideration for million in interest bearing promissory notes 
as a result of the sale of vinifera common stock back to vinifera  we deconsolidated vinifera  excluded our share of vinifera s operating losses for the first quarter of of  and recorded the following amounts as an adjustment to goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of agritope a write down of the value of acquired developed technology attributable to vinifera of  a gain on sale of vinifera shares of  and a promissory note reserve of  the net adjustment was an increase to goodwill in the amount of  beginning april   we accounted for our remaining investment in vinifera using the cost method 
due to risks associated with collection  as of december   we reserved for of these promissory notes 
due to a significant decline in the operating performance of vinifera  in december  we wrote down our remaining cost basis investment in vinifera to zero 
we were advised in march that vinifera was in the process of being liquidated 
acquisition of metaxen assets in july  we acquired substantially all the assets of metaxen  a biotechnology company focused on molecular genetics 
in addition to paying cash consideration of million  we assumed a note payable relating to certain acquired assets with a principal balance of million 
we also assumed responsibility for a facility lease relating to the office and laboratory space occupied by metaxen 
at the time of the acquisition  metaxen had an existing research collaboration with eli lilly company 
this agreement provided for sponsored research payments to be made to metaxen 
we completed the work under this arrangement in october accordingly  we received and recognized revenues of approximately million in fulfillment of that arrangement 
critical accounting policies we believe the following are our critical accounting policies revenue recognition most of our revenues are generated from complex research and licensing arrangements 
these research and licensing arrangements may include up front non refundable payments 
although these up front payments are generally non refundable  under generally accepted accounting principles gaap we defer the revenues under these arrangements and recognize the revenues on a straight line basis over the relevant periods specified in the agreements  generally the research term 
our research and license arrangements may also include milestone payments 
although these milestone payments are generally non refundable once the milestone is achieved  we recognize the milestone revenues on a straight line basis over the contractual term of the arrangement 
this typically results in a portion of the milestone being recognized at the date of the milestone is achieved  and the balance being recognized over the remaining term of the agreement 
it is our understanding that there is diversity in practice on the recognition of milestone revenue 
other companies have adopted an alternative acceptable milestone revenue recognition policy whereby the full milestone fee is recognized upon completion of the milestone 
if we had adopted such a policy  our revenues recorded to date would have increased and our deferred revenues would have decreased by an immaterial amount compared to total revenue recognized 
revenues from chemistry collaborations are generally recognized upon the delivery of accepted compounds 
exit costs prior to the december  acquisition date for genomica  we began to formulate an exit plan for genomica to improve the operating efficiency of the combined company 
this plan was based upon a restructuring plan genomica implemented in october and called for the reduction of substantially all of genomica s workforce and the abandonment of leased facilities in boulder  colorado and sacramento  california 
these activities are expected to be completed during the first half of certain key terminated individuals were retained as consultants by us to assist in further licensing and development of genomica s technology to third parties 
as of december   we have recorded significant reserves pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlement of contractual obligations  such as operating lease commitments  resulting from these actions 
the actual costs related to the exit activities may differ from the amounts recorded as of december  for example  we have reserved for our maximum obligations under genomica s operating lease commitments 
however  these operating lease commitments may be resolved in a more favorable manner  such as the possibility of successfully subleasing the abandoned space 
conversely  we may not be able to resolve other contractual obligations at the amounts we have provided as of december  goodwill and intangible impairment as of december   our consolidated balance sheet includes approximately million of goodwill and other intangible assets 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we will evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual impairment tests indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we will also evaluate other intangible assets for impairment when impairment indicators are identified 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
these estimates include forecasted revenues  which are inherently difficult to predict 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
furthermore  our impairment evaluation of goodwill will require management to exercise judgment in the identification of our reporting units 
the impairment test for goodwill will be performed at the reporting unit level  which may be one level below the operating segments disclosed in our current financial statements  depending upon whether certain criteria are met 
contingencies we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to environmental  intellectual property  product  employment and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended december   and total revenues total revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in the increase from to resulted principally from license and contract revenues earned from the signing of new collaboration agreements with protein design labs and bristol myers squibb  additional revenues under our existing collaborative agreements with bayer  bristol myers squibb  dow agrosciences and aventis and  to a lesser extent  accelerated revenue recognition related to the mutually agreed termination of our collaboration with pharmacia which terminated in february in  revenues increased from due to additional license and contract revenues earned from existing collaborations with bayer  pharmacia and bristol myers squibb as well as revenues from a new collaboration with dow agrosciences 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  facilities costs  supplies  licenses and depreciation of facilities and laboratory equipment 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in the increase in over resulted primarily from the following costs increased personnel staffing costs at december  increased by approximately to approximately million from december  the increase was to support new collaborative arrangements and exelixis internal proprietary research efforts  including increased expenses related to staff hired with the acquisition of artemis in may and agritope in december salary  bonuses  related fringe benefits  recruiting and relocation costs are included in personnel costs 
we expect these personnel costs to increase further as we continue to build our organization 
increased lab supplies as a result of the increase in personnel and the significant expansion of drug discovery operations  lab supplies increased to approximately million during increased licenses and consulting to support new collaborative arrangements and further development of proprietary programs  license and consulting expenses increased to approximately million during as part of our new collaboration with bristol myers squibb in july  we received an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize a selected analogue of the bristol myers squibb anticancer compound  deae rebeccamycin 
phase i trials of deae rebeccamycin have been completed and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile 
in ongoing phase ii trials  being conducted by the national cancer institute  the compound has demonstrated activity against some tumor types 
planning for additional clinical studies is currently underway and should be finalized later in during we established a clinical research and development staff and we plan to grow this staff in future years 
we currently do not have manufacturing capabilities or experience necessary to produce materials for clinical trials 
we plan to rely on collaborators and third party contractors to produce materials for clinical trials 
we expect clinical costs will increase in the future as we enter clinical trials for new product candidates and additional trials for deae rebeccamycin 
we currently do not have estimates of total costs to reach the market by a particular drug candidate or in total 
our potential therapeutic products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process that may not result in the necessary regulatory approvals  which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize products 
in addition  clinical trials on our potential products may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy  which could prevent or significantly delay regulatory approval 
the increases in research and development expenses from and were due primarily to increased staffing and other personnel related costs and non cash stock compensation expense as described below 
these expenses were incurred to support new collaborative arrangements and proprietary programs 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development  and it expects that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollar amounts in the future as we continue to advance drug discovery and development programs  including clinical development 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of staffing costs to support our research activities  facilities costs and professional expenses  such as legal fees 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in the increase in over was primarily due to increased staffing in support of our expanded research and development activities  partially offset by a decrease in non cash stock compensation expense of million as described below 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to related primarily to increased recruiting expenses  non cash stock compensation expense as described below and rent for facilities and expenses associated with moving into our corporate headquarters in south san francisco 
stock compensation expense deferred stock compensation for options granted to our employees is the difference between the fair value for financial reporting purposes of our common stock on the date such options were granted and their exercise price 
deferred stock compensation for options granted to consultants has been determined based upon estimated fair value  using the black scholes option valuation model 
as of december   we have approximately million of remaining deferred stock compensation  related to stock options granted to consultants and employees 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and consultants  we recorded no deferred stock compensation in the year ended december   compared to million in and million in these amounts were recorded as a component of stockholders equity deficit and are being amortized as stock compensation expense over the vesting periods of the options  which is generally four years 
we recognized stock compensation expense of million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in the decrease in stock compensation expense in compared to primarily results from the accelerated amortization method used for accounting purposes 
the increase in stock compensation expense in compared to was due the increase in deferred stock charges at the time of our initial public offering 
during april  we granted approximately  supplemental stock options supplemental options under the equity incentive plan to certain employees excluding officers and directors who had stock options with exercise prices greater than per share under the equity incentive plan 
the number of supplemental options granted was equal to of the corresponding original grant held by each employee 
the supplemental options have an exercise price of  vest monthly over a two year period beginning april   and have a month term 
the vesting on the corresponding original stock options was suspended and will resume in april following the completion of vesting of the supplemental options 
this new grant constitutes a synthetic repricing as defined in fasb interpretation number  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation and will result in certain options being reported using the variable plan method of accounting for stock compensation expense until they are exercised  forfeited or expire 
for the year ended december   compensation expense recorded for the supplemental options was  acquired in process research and development the valuation of the purchased in process research and development related to the artemis acquisition of million was determined by management based upon the results of an independent valuation using the income approach for each of the three significant in process projects 
the in process projects relate primarily to the development of technologies that use vertebrate genetic model organisms  zebra fish and mice  to identify and functionally validate novel genes in vivo 
these genes can be used as novel screening targets or as the basis for secreted proteins in clinically and commercially relevant diseases 
the in process projects are expected to be completed in december of the income approach estimates the value of each acquired project in process based on its expected future cash flows 
the valuation analysis considered the contribution of the core technology as well as the percent complete of each in process research and development project 
the expected present value of the cash flows associated with the in process research and development projects was computed using a risk adjusted rate of return of  which is considered commensurate with the overall risk and percent complete of the in process projects 
the purchased in process technology was not considered to have reached technological feasibility  and it has no alternative future use  accordingly  it was recorded as a component of operating expenses 
in connection with the agritope purchase in fiscal year  we recorded expense of million relating to acquired in process research and development 
the valuation of the purchased in process research and development was based upon the results of an independent valuation using the income approach for each of the ten projects in process 
the in process projects relate primarily to the development of disease and insect resistant fruits and vegetables and are expected to be completed over approximately the next three and one half years 
the income approach estimates the value of each acquired project in process based on its expected future cash flows 
the valuation analysis considered the contribution of the core technology as well as the percent complete of each in process research and development project 
the expected present value of the cash flows associated with the in process research and development projects was computed using a risk adjusted rate of return of which is considered commensurate with the overall risk and percent complete of the in process projects 
the purchased technology was not considered to have reached technological feasibility  and it has no alternative future use  accordingly  it was recorded as a component operating expense 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles goodwill and intangibles result from our acquisitions of genomica  artemis and agritope 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles was million for the year ended december   compared to  in and zero in the increase in was the result of amortization of goodwill and intangibles from the agritope acquisition for months compared to only one month in as well as the amortization of goodwill and intangibles from the acquisition of artemis 
under sfas  we will apply the new rules of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of accordingly  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with sfas interest income expense  net net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million of net income in and  of net income in interest income expense  net consists of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  reduced by interest expense incurred on notes payable and capital lease obligations 
the decrease in from was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense related to notes payables and capital leases 
the increase in from primarily relates to interest income earned on the proceeds from our initial public offering 
minority interest and equity in net loss of affiliated company on march   we reduced our ownership interest in vinifera  inc to 
beginning april   we accounted for our remaining investment in vinifera using the cost method 
due to a significant decline in the operating performance of vinifera  in december  we wrote down our investment in vinifera to zero 
for  minority interest in subsidiary net loss represents the minority shareholders portion of vinifera s operating loss 
net loss reported by us  which is attributable to the minority shareholders  was approximately  in since we owned in excess of of vinifera  we consolidated vinifera s operating results  a portion of which was then allocated to the minority shareholders as minority interest in proportion to their ownership interest  partially offsetting our operating loss 
income taxes we have incurred net operating losses since inception and  consequently  have not recorded any federal or state income taxes 
as of december   we had federal and california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we had federal research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million in each jurisdiction 
if not utilized  the net operating loss and credit carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in under the internal revenue code  as amended  and similar state provisions  certain substantial changes in our ownership could result in an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards that can be utilized in future years to offset future taxable income 
annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating loss and credit carry forwards before they are used 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of preferred stock  loans  equipment lease financings and other loan facilities and payments from collaborators 
in addition  during the second quarter of  we completed our initial public offering raising million in net cash proceeds 
in addition  in december  we acquired genomica  inc  including million in cash and investments 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our operating activities used cash of million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in cash used in operating activities during each year related primarily to funding net operating losses  partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue from collaborators and non cash charges related to acquired in process research and development  depreciation and amortization of deferred stock compensation 
our investing activities provided cash of million for the year ended december   compared to cash used of million in and million in the cash provided in consisted of cash resulting from the acquisitions of artemis and genomica  proceeds from maturities of short term investments and sale of an investment before maturity  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment and purchases of short term investments 
the use of cash for consists primarily of purchases of short term investments and property and equipment  partially offset by proceeds from maturities of short term investments and proceeds from sale leaseback of equipment 
in  investing activities consist primarily of purchases of property  equipment and short term investments 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and its administrative infrastructure  including the purchase of property and equipment to support its expanding operations 
our financing activities provided cash of million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in the cash provided in consisted of million proceeds from the issuance of common stock to bristol myers squibb as part of the collaboration agreement and million from a convertible note with protein design labs  partially offset by principal payments on capital leases and note payable 
cash provided from financing activities in and consisted primarily of proceeds from our initial public offering  sales of preferred stock  and amounts received under various financing arrangements 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and funding to be received from collaborators  will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for at least the next two years 
changes in our operating plan as well as factors described in our risk factors elsewhere in this annual report on form k could require us to consume available resources much sooner than we expect 
it is possible that we will seek additional financing within this timeframe 
we may raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
in july  we filed a registration statement on form s to offer and sell up to million of common stock 
we have no current commitments to offer or sell securities with respect to shares that may be offered or sold pursuant to that filing 
we cannot assure you that additional funding  if sought  will be available or  even if available  will be available on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm its business and operating results 
commitments we do not have any special purpose entities that are unconsolidated in our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements of cash 
we are also not involved with non exchange traded commodity contracts accounted for at fair value 
we have no commercial commitments with related parties  except for employee loans 
we have contractual obligations in the form of operating and capital leases  notes payable and licensing agreements 
these are described in further detail in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following chart details our contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period s less than after contractual obligations total year years years years capital lease obligations 




    operating leases 








     convertible promissory notes 


  notes payable 










  licensing agreements 






    total contractual cash obligations      we had outstanding loans aggregating  and  to certain officers and employees at december  and  respectively 
the notes are general recourse or collateralized by certain real property assets  bear interest at rates ranging from to and have maturities through the principal plus accrued interest will be forgiven at various rates over three to four years from the employees date of employment with us 
if an employee leaves us  all unpaid and unforgiven principal and interest will be due and payable within days 
as of december   we had outstanding loans aggregating million to our stockholders 
the loans were issued to enable certain employees to purchase stock pursuant to their employee stock options 
the loans bear interest at rates ranging from to and mature at various times through february recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
business combinations sfas no 
 which establishes financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and supersedes apb opinion no 
 business combinations  and fasb statement no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for using one method  the purchase method 
the provisions of sfas no 
apply to all business combinations initiated after june  the adoption of sfas no 
had no material impact on our financial reporting and related disclosures 
in july  the fasb issued sfas  which establishes financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
sfas addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets but not those acquired in a business combination should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition  and after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt sfas during the first quarter of fiscal  and are in the process of evaluating the impact of implementation on our financial position and results of operations 
application of the non amortization provisions of the statement is expected to result in a decrease to net loss of approximately million in  as compared to the prior accounting requirements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investments are subject to interest rate risk  and our interest income may fluctuate due to changes in us interest rates 
by policy  we limit our investments to money market instruments  debt securities of us government agencies and debt obligations of us corporations 
we manage market risk by our diversification requirements  which limit the amount of our portfolio that can be invested in a single issuer 
we manage credit risk by limiting our purchases to high quality issuers 
through our money manager  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques  including sensitivity analysis 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would cause an approximately million and  decline in the fair value of our financial instruments at december  and  respectively 
all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents 
exelixis views its available for sale portfolio as available for use in current operations 
accordingly  we have classified all investments with an original maturity date greater than three months as short term  even though the stated maturity date may be one year or more beyond the current balance sheet date 
due to our german operations  we have market risk exposure to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the revenues and expenses of our german subsidiaries were denominated in deutschmark but changed to eurodollars on january  at the end of each reporting period  the revenues and expenses of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using the average currency rate in effect for the period  and assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period 
fluctuations in exchange rates  therefore  impact our financial condition and results of operations as reported in us dollars 
to date  we have not experienced any significant negative impact as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency markets
