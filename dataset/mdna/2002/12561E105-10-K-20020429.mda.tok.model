item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our strategies as shown in the segment quarterly net income loss  table above  as well as the information contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  carl s jr 
operates profitably and hardee s operates at a loss 
in viewing the segments  we allocate much of our general and administrative expenses and all of our interest to each of the segments 
on that basis  hardee s has been operating at a loss  excluding facility action charges  of approximately million per month during the last fiscal year 
in order for our business turnaround to be successful  we must improve hardee s operations 
we expect to execute our business turnaround through the following strategies continue our focus on quality  service and cleanliness at hardee s 
working with our outside advertising firm  develop an updated brand image for hardee s with the objective of reconnecting the brand with today s qsr consumer 
continue to maintain the carl s jr

continue our focus on cost control 
grow our system by opening to new carl s jr 
restaurants and to new hardee s restaurants next fiscal year 
continue our programs to remodel up to hardee s restaurants  and install charbroilers in all our hardee s restaurants 
integrate the acquisition of santa barbara restaurant group  inc sbrg see recent developments below 
develop a strategy for addressing the maturity of our approximately million of convertible notes see item management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations below 
the key success factor in operating hardee s profitably is increasing sales 
at the end of the fiscal year  the average unit volume auv at our company owned hardee s restaurants was approximately  we estimate that for the concept to operate profitably  the auv must be in the range of  to  we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in improving hardee s auv to those levels

restaurant concepts carl s jr 
concept 
we believe that our carl s jr 
restaurants offer superior food quality  a diverse menu and attentive customer service  which differentiate carl s jr 
from its competitors and are critical to its success 
carl s jr 
restaurants focus on offering customers a quality dining experience  including premium products  at a reasonable price 
the menu at carl s jr 
features freshly prepared food items that appeal to a broad audience 
we generally make carl s jr 
charbroiled hamburgers  chicken sandwiches and signature items at the time of the customer s order  applying exacting quality standards and offering them in generous portions 
by providing partial table service  unlimited drink refills and an attractive restaurant decor  carl s jr 
restaurants offer a pleasant  customer friendly environment 
we believe that our focus on our customers and customer service  superior food quality and generous portions enables carl s jr 
restaurants to maintain a strong price value image with customers that has met with relative success 
our carl s jr 
auv s were million at january menu and restaurant design 
carl s jr 
restaurants offer a variety of products that have a strong reputation for quality and taste 
the carl s jr 
menu is relatively uniform throughout the chain and features several charbroiled hamburgers and chicken sandwiches  including the six dollar burger  famous star  western bacon cheeseburger  super star  charbroiler chicken sandwiches  crispy chicken sandwiches  the sourdough bacon cheeseburger and the spicy chicken sandwich 
we also offer a fish sandwich  stuffed baked potatoes  prepackaged salads  french fries  onion rings and fried zucchini 
most carl s jr 
restaurants also have self service salad bars and a breakfast menu including eggs  bacon  sausage  french toast dips  the sunrise sandwich  croissant sunrise sandwich and a breakfast burrito 
in addition  the restaurants sell a variety of promotional products on a limited basis 
carl s jr 
was among the first to offer self service salad bars and all you can drink beverage bars 
most carl s jr 
restaurants are freestanding  ranging in size from  to  square feet  with a seating capacity of to persons and drive thru facilities 
some restaurants are located in shopping malls and other in line facilities 
currently  several building designs and floor plans are in use system wide  depending upon operational needs  local zoning requirements and real estate availability 
substantially all of our carl s jr 
restaurants have bright colored exteriors  red awnings and a large  tilted happy star logo 
the interiors feature the same bright colors  food murals  display cases for salads and desserts and accent lighting throughout the dining area 
we believe that carl s jr 
s restaurant design further increases consumer awareness of the carl s jr 
brand 
over the next year we plan to develop a prototype for a more updated design and commence on a remodel program for selected carl s jr 
restaurants 
operations 
we strive to maintain high standards in all products and equipment used by our restaurants  as well as our operations related to food preparation  service and cleanliness 
we generally prepare or assemble hamburgers and chicken sandwiches at carl s jr 
restaurants after the customer has placed an order and serve them promptly 
we charbroil hamburger patties and chicken breasts in a gas fired double broiler that sears the meat on both sides in a uniform heating and cooking time 
a general manager who has received nine to weeks of management training operates each company operated carl s jr 
restaurant 
this training program involves a combination of classroom instruction and on the job training in specially designated training restaurants 
the general manager trains other employees in accordance with our guidelines 
district managers  who are responsible for to restaurants  also supervise general managers 
approximately district managers are under the supervision of a regional vice president  who regularly inspects the operations in their respective district and region 
dual branding 
dual branding allows a single restaurant to offer consumers two distinct brand menus 
in may  we entered into an initial agreement with sbrg to offer the green burrito menu at selected carl s jr 
locations 
we believe green burrito s position in the popular mexican food segment and its dinner menu orientation complement the carl s jr 
menu 
customers of the carl s jr 
green burrito dual brand restaurants are able to order items from both menu boards located at the same counter 
both menus are also available to customers utilizing the drive thru 
the green burrito menu offered at the dual brand restaurants features a wide variety of traditional mexican food items  including burritos  enchiladas  tacos  taquitos and nachos  as well as combination meals which are served with rice and beans 
a variety of cke restaurants  inc 
condiments such as jalapeno peppers  hot sauce and mild and hot salsa are available at self serve salsa bars so that customers can spice and garnish their meals according to individual taste 
in order to convert an existing carl s jr 
restaurant to a carl s jr 
green burrito restaurant  the additional equipment necessary to offer the green burrito menu is added to the carl s jr 
restaurant  as well as new menu boards and new signage  both inside and outside  indicating the offering of both brands 
in most cases  changes to the seating area or other parts of the physical structure of the restaurant are unnecessary 
we believe that this dual branding program has attracted new customers  while increasing the frequency of customer visits at converted restaurants 
our dual branded carl s jr 
green burrito restaurants have the highest average unit volumes in the system  at million at january  as of january   carl s jr 
company operated locations have been converted to carl s jr 
green burrito dual concept restaurants  and we paid a franchise fee and royalty to sbrg  the owner of the green burrito brand 
at the end of fiscal  we elected to sub franchise  and shortly thereafter began offering  the carl s jr 
green burrito dual brand to our franchise community 
as of january   franchised carl s jr 
restaurants have been converted to the carl s jr 
green burrito concept 
on march   we acquired sbrg see recent developments below  which owns the green burrito brand 
this acquisition gives us control of the menu and further development of the brand  and eliminates our franchise fee and royalty expense 
we receive a franchise fee for each franchise conversion and royalties from our franchisees green burrito food sales 
franchised and licensed operations 
our franchise strategy is designed to further the development of the carl s jr 
chain and reduce the total capital we need to develop new carl s jr 
restaurants 
franchise arrangements with carl s jr 
franchisees  which operate in arizona  california  colorado  hawaii  idaho  nevada  new mexico  oklahoma  oregon  texas and utah  generally provide for initial fees and continuing royalty payments and advertising fees to us based upon a percentage of gross sales generally for royalties and to for advertising 
additionally  most franchisees purchase food  paper and other supplies from us 
franchisees may also be obligated to remit lease payments for the use of company owned or leased restaurant facilities and to pay related occupancy costs  which include maintenance  insurance and property taxes 
we also plan to continue to pursue non traditional franchise development opportunities through innovative formats  including gasoline stations  convenience stores and institutional food service outlets 
our franchising and licensing philosophy is that only candidates with appropriate operational experience and financial stability are considered for the program 
specific net worth and liquidity requirements must be satisfied 
area development agreements generally require franchisees to open a specified number of carl s jr 
restaurants in a designated geographic area within a specified time period 
as of january   our carl s jr 
franchisees and licensees operated carl s jr 
restaurants 
the majority of our carl s jr 
franchisees own more than one restaurant  with franchisees owning seven or more restaurants 
we presently anticipate that our carl s jr 
franchisees and licensees will open approximately new carl s jr 
restaurants during fiscal purchasing and distribution 
we purchase most of the primary food products and packaging supplies used in our carl s jr 
restaurant system and warehouse and distribute such items to both company operated and franchised carl s jr 
restaurants 
although not required to do so  all of our carl s jr 
franchisees in california purchase most of their supplies from us 
our carl s jr 
restaurant chain is one of the few businesses in the quick service restaurant industry that has elected not to outsource all of its distribution activities because we believe our mature procurement process allows us to effectively manage our food costs  provide adequate quantities of food and supplies at competitive prices  and generate revenue from carl s jr 
franchisees by adding a nominal mark up to cover direct costs and provide better overall service to our restaurants in california 
we seek competitive bids from suppliers on many of our products  approve suppliers of those products and require them to adhere to our established product specifications 
however  for our outlying markets  we are in the process of analyzing our distribution center business and other options for distributing food products and supplies to these carl s jr 
restaurants 
hardee s concept 
hardee s has a leading market presence in the southeastern and midwestern united states 
the hardee s restaurant chain offers a variety of menu items  including breakfast and certain made to order lunch and dinner offerings cke restaurants  inc 
including charbroiled hamburgers in those restaurants that have been remodeled 
hardee s restaurants emphasize hometown hospitality by providing generous portions at reasonable prices in a friendly environment 
currently  hardee s has shifted its focus from discount  variety products to premium products  such as the six dollar burger 
menu and restaurant design 
hardee s restaurants currently offer hamburgers  chicken sandwiches  roast beef sandwiches and fish sandwiches for lunch and dinner  as well as fried chicken in our restaurants located in certain markets 
unlike many quick service hamburger restaurants  a significant portion of hardee s day part is breakfast 
breakfast generates approximately of hardee s overall operating revenue  one of the highest in the quick service hamburger industry 
hardee s breakfast menu features made from scratch biscuits  biscuit breakfast sandwiches and other items such as hash rounds and breakfast platters 
substantially all of hardee s restaurants have drive thru facilities  and selected restaurants are open hours a day  primarily on the weekends 
most hardee s restaurants are freestanding  ranging in size from  to  square feet  with a seating capacity of to persons 
currently  several building designs and floor plans are in use system wide  depending upon operational needs  local zoning requirements and real estate availability 
since our acquisition of hardee s  we introduced certain made to order lunch and dinner menu items that are currently served in our carl s jr 
restaurants  such as the six dollar burger  the famous star and other signature products from carl s jr 
our efforts to improve operations at hardee s have begun producing positive results 
as shown in the table on page  hardee s has experienced three consecutive quarters of positive same store sales after several years decline 
we have also begun implementing the carl s jr 
style limited table service and added all you can drink beverage bars in all of our hardee s restaurants 
additionally  we are remodeling our hardee s restaurants to a new star hardee s format  which we designed to update and revitalize the hardee s brand with the menu and operating qualities of carl s jr 
a star hardee s remodel involves installing charbroilers in the kitchens  remodeling the interior and exterior of the restaurant and installing new signage that accents the hardee s name with a star logo 
over the past year  we  along with some franchisees  have been able to revise the remodel  and thus have been able to significantly reduce the cost 
we believe that the revised remodels offer consumers the same quality dining experience as the original star hardee s conversion 
as of january   we had remodeled  or approximately  of our hardee s company restaurants 
operations 
we strive to maintain high standards in all products and equipment used by our hardee s restaurants  as well as the operations related to food preparation  service and cleanliness 
our initial attempts to implement all of the elements in a typical carl s jr 
restaurant at a hardee s did not yield the improvements that we had anticipated 
therefore  we identified those elements that we believed had been successfully transitioned in hardee s markets  primarily the installation of gas fired charbroilers  and focused on those changes on a go forward basis 
additionally  we have focused on the fundamentals of restaurant operations quality  service and cleanliness 
it is our belief that a renewed focus on those factors forms the basis for improved restaurant operations and the recent increases in same store sales 
franchised and licensed operations 
franchise agreements with hardee s franchisees  who operate restaurants in the southeastern and midwestern united states  generally provide for initial fees and continuing royalty payments to us based upon a percentage of gross sales generally 
franchisees are required to purchase certain inventory and supplies from approved suppliers and are required to spend a minimum percentage of sales each month on advertising 
in addition  most franchisees are required to purchase and install all fixtures  furnishings  signs and equipment specified in the approved site layout and plan 
prior to the opening of franchised restaurant  the general manager of each franchise is required to attend and complete our company sponsored training program 
franchisees may also be required to remit lease payments for the use of our company owned or leased restaurant facilities and to pay related occupancy costs 
at hardee s  average unit volumes for our international licensed restaurants were  in fiscal and total sales at hardee s international restaurants exceeded million 
since our acquisition of hardee s  we have worked to develop and enhance a productive relationship with our hardee s franchisees 
we have been supportive in establishing a franchise association and have improved communications with franchisees 
as a result  our hardee s franchisees have collectively increased their level of royalty payment and advertising contribution compliance 
our hardee s franchisees have joined us in our star hardee s remodel program and  as of january   operated franchised star hardee s restaurants 
cke restaurants  inc 
as of january   franchisees and licensees operated  hardee s restaurants 
the majority of our hardee s franchisees own more than one restaurant  with franchisees owning or more restaurants 
purchasing and distribution 
we currently purchase substantially all of the food  packaging and cleaning products sold or used in our hardee s restaurants from fast food merchandisers  inc ffm and mbm corporation mbm 
mbm  which was the primary distributor for fei  acquired ffm in  and consequently consolidated substantially all of hardee s distribution requirements 
ffm and mbm currently distribute products to company operated restaurants and to many of the hardee s restaurants operated by our franchisees 
pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreements  we are obligated to purchase substantially all of our specified product requirements from ffm and mbm for remaining terms of four years each 
the prices we pay for ffm and mbm products  and the delivery fees we pay each distribution service  are subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  which may include increases resulting from changes in the distributor s cost structure 
investments in other restaurant concepts in the past  we have invested in other restaurant concepts  as described below see also note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  we shifted our primary focus to our core concepts 
rally s and checkers 
through a series of transactions  the company has various investments in checkers drive in restaurants  inc checkers which  as of january   consisted of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock 
checkers operates and franchises approximately checkers and rally s double drive thru quick service hamburger restaurants  primarily in the southeastern and midwestern united states 
through fiscal  we accounted for our investment in checkers under the equity method of accounting  as our chairman of the board was the chairman of checkers 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we wrote down our investment in checkers by million to its fair market value upon our conclusion that the investment had experienced an other than temporary decline in value 
further  as a result of recognizing our share of the net losses of checkers  our investment in checkers was zero as of january  our chairman is no longer the chairman of checkers  however  he is still a member of the board of directors 
during fiscal and  we sold  and  shares respectively  and generated net proceeds of million and million respectively 
on april   cke exercised its warrant to purchase shares of checker s stock and received net shares of  as of april  we own  shares of checker s stock  respresenting of the outstanding shares 
boston market 
we held a minority interest in boston west  llc boston west  which operated boston market restaurants in designated markets in southern california as a franchised area developer of boston chicken  inc bci  the franchisor of the boston market restaurant concept 
bci and its boston market subsidiaries filed for protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code on october  in a separate action  on november   boston west filed a voluntary petition under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code in order to restructure its overall operations 
in april  boston market corporation bmc  a wholly owned subsidiary of mcdonald s corp  acquired bci s rights  claims and interests relating to boston west 
as a result  boston west and bmc filed a joint plan of reorganization that was approved by the bankruptcy court 
under this plan  we no longer have an ownership interest in boston west or any of the boston market restaurants operated by boston west 
additionally  under the plan  boston west was dissolved 
taco bueno 
on june   we sold our taco bueno concept 
the net proceeds from the sale were approximately million and were used to permanently reduce our bank debt see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
santa barbara restaurant group 
on march  we acquired santa barbara restaurant group  inc and its la salsa  green burrito and timber lodge steakhouse restaurant brands see recent developments and note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
although we have no present intention to acquire additional interests in other restaurant concepts  we may do so in the future depending on the business prospects of the restaurant concept  the availability of financing at attractive terms  alternative business opportunities available to us  the consent of our senior lenders  if required  and general economic conditions 
cke restaurants  inc 
critical accounting policies our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments 
these judgements involve estimations about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations and financial condition 
specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as expected  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
we believe our most significant policies require estimation of future cash flows used to assess the recoverability of long lived assets and establishment of store closure reserves 
determination of the appropriate allowances associated with franchise and license receivables and contingent liabilities 
estimation  using actuarially determined methods  of our self insured losses under our workers compensation and fire and general liability insurance programs not covered under our stop loss policy 
estimation of our net deferred income tax asset valuation allowance 
a detailed description of the critical accounting policies are as follows 
impairment of property  equipment  property held for sale and goodwill we evaluate the carrying value of assets for impairment when the operations of the brand  or certain restaurants in the brand  experience a negative event ie  significant downturn in operations  natural disaster  restaurant closures  etc when these events are identified  we review the last two years of operations on a restaurant by restaurant basis and  if there are increasing losses  we estimate future undiscounted cash flows 
if the projected cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the assets  including goodwill  which is allocated to each restaurant for this purpose  we write down the assets to fair value  based on either estimated net proceeds our third party broker a related party see item certain relationships and related transactions believes it can obtain in a sale of the site  discounted projected cash flows  or historical net proceeds obtained on other similar surplus property sales 
the most significant assumptions we use in this analysis are those made in estimating future cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows we generally use the financial assumptions in our strategic plan and modify them if the operators believe other factors should be used 
additionally  in determining the amount we can obtain in a sale of a site  we use our broker s knowledge of the area the property is located in and current sales trends 
see discussion of sfas goodwill and other intangible assets on page statement or financial accounting standard no 
sfas self insurance we are self insured for a portion of our current and prior years losses related to workers compensation  fire and general liability insurance programs 
we have obtained stop loss insurance for individual workers compensation claims over  and individual general liability claims over  insurance liabilities and reserves are accounted for based on the net present value of independent actuarial estimates of the amount of loss expected 
these estimates rely on actuarial observations of historical claim loss development for similar events 
we continually evaluate the potential for changes in loss estimates  and use the results of these evaluations to adjust recorded provisions 
the assumptions used by the independent actuary to determine the liability balance are based on the average historical loss rates we ve incurred 
if the actual loss development is better or worse than the development estimated by the actuary  we will modify the reserve and it will be reflected in future operating performance 
additionally  if we experience a higher than expected number of claims or the costs of claims rise more than we expected  then the actuary will probably adjust expected losses upward and our future self insurance costs will rise 
store closure reserves we make decisions to close restaurants based on prospects for future estimated profitability 
our restaurant operators evaluate each restaurant s performance each financial period 
when restaurants perform poorly  we consider the cke restaurants  inc 
demographics of the location as well as the likelihood of being able to turn an unprofitable restaurant around 
based on the operator s judgment  we estimate the future cash flows 
if we determine that the restaurants will not be profitable  and there are no contractual requirements to continue operating the restaurant  we close the restaurant 
additionally  franchisees may close restaurants for which we are the primary lessee 
if the franchisee cannot make payments on the lease  we continue making the lease payments and establish a store closure reserve if we decide not to operate the restaurant as a company operated restaurant 
we establish the reserve in the period we decide to close a restaurant  which may be before the actual closure date 
the store closure reserve for vacant properties is generally based on the term of the lease and the lease termination fee we expect to pay  as well as maintenance costs 
the amount of the reserve established is generally the net present value of these estimated future payments 
the interest rate used to calculate the net present value of these reserves is based on our incremental borrowing rate at the time the reserve is established 
the related discount is amortized and shown as interest expense in our statement of operations 
one significant assumption used in determining the amount of store closure reserves is the estimated costs to maintain leased and owned vacant properties 
additionally  the amount of the reserve established for future lease payments on vacant restaurants is based upon our third party broker s assessment of its ability to successfully negotiate early termination of our lease agreements with the lessors 
if the costs to maintain properties increase  or it takes longer than anticipated to sell properties or terminate leases  we may need to record additional reserves 
if the leases on the vacant restaurants are not terminated on the terms we used to estimate the reserves  we may be required to record losses in future periods 
conversely if the leases on the vacant restaurants are terminated on more favorable terms than we used to estimate the reserves  we may reverse previously established reserves 
franchise and licensed operations we monitor the financial condition of franchisees and record provisions for estimated losses on receivables when we believe that our franchisees are unable to make their required payments to us 
we review quarterly each franchisee s account  focusing on those that are past due  and determine a specific reserve for each account  if necessary  including notes receivable 
additionally  we cease recording royalties from franchisees that are delinquent in paying or in default until such time as we have a history of timely payments 
depending on the facts and circumstances  there are a number of different actions we may take to resolve collections issues 
these may include the sale of franchise restaurants to us or to other franchisees  a modification to the franchise agreement which may include a provision for reduced royalty rates in the future if royalty rates are not sufficient to cover our costs of service over the life of the franchise agreement  we record the estimated loss at the time we modify the agreements  a restructuring of the franchisee s business and or finances including the restructuring of leases for which we are the primary obligee see further discussion below or  if necessary  the termination of the franchise agreement 
the allowance established is based on our assessment of the most probable action that will occur 
if we believe we will operate the restaurants as company operated restaurants  the allowance for loss is recorded net of the estimated fair value of the related restaurant assets 
as part of our re franchising program  many of the restaurants that we sold to franchisees were on leased sites 
generally  we remained principally liable for the lease and entered into a sublease with the franchisee for the same terms of the primary lease 
we account for the sublease payments received as franchising rental income and our payments on the leases as rental expense in franchising expense 
as of january   the net present value of the total obligation on such lease arrangements was million 
the determination of when to establish a reserve for future lease obligations on restaurants operated by franchisees for which we are the primary obligee is based on the date that the following events occur a franchisee and the company mutually make the decision to close a restaurant and we will assume the responsibility for the lease  cke restaurants  inc 
when a franchise agreement is terminated or the franchisee declares bankruptcy  or we enter into a workout agreement with a financially troubled franchisee  where we agree to make part or all of the lease payment for the franchisee 
the amount of the reserve is established using the methodology described in the store closure reserve section above 
we have not established reserves for troubled franchisees ie  those franchisees that are delinquent or for which we have entered into a workout arrangement who  as of january   are still making timely rent payments but may have problems in the future 
the net present value of the related lease obligation with franchisees in these circumstances is approximately million 
the lease reserve for closed franchise restaurants is dependent on our ability to successfully negotiate early termination of our lease agreements with our lessors within the ranges we estimated to establish the reserve 
if sales trends economic conditions worsen for our franchisees  their financial health may worsen  our collection rates may decline and we may be required to assume the responsibility for additional lease payments on franchised restaurants 
entering into restructured franchise agreements may result in reduced franchise royalty rates in the future 
valuation allowance for net deferred tax asset as disclosed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  we record net deferred tax assets 
annually  we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
during fiscal  because we had experienced two years of net operating losses  we established a valuation reserve for our net deferred tax asset 
reversal of the reserve is dependent upon the company reporting taxable operating profits in future periods 
the assumptions used to determine this reserve are based on suggested guidance from the securities and exchange commission regarding the definition of the more likely than not criterion contained in sfas no 
competition the restaurant business is intensely competitive and affected by changes in a geographic area  changes in the public s eating habits and preferences  local and national economic conditions affecting consumer spending habits  population trends and local traffic patterns 
key elements of competition in the industry are the quality and value of food products offered  quality and speed of service  advertising effectiveness  brand name identification  restaurant locations and attractiveness of facilities 
we primarily compete with major restaurant chains  some of whom dominate the quick service restaurant industry  and also compete with a variety of other take out foodservice companies and fast food restaurants 
our competitors also include a variety of mid price  full service casual dining restaurants  health and nutrition oriented restaurants  delicatessens and prepared food restaurants  as well as supermarkets and convenience stores 
in selling franchises  we compete with many other restaurant franchisors  some of whom have substantially greater financial resources and higher franchise auv s 
trademarks and service marks we own numerous trademarks and service marks  and have registered many of those marks  including carl s jr  the happy star logo  hardee s and proprietary names for a number of the carl s jr 
and hardee s menu items  with the united states patent and trademark office 
we believe our trademarks and service marks have value and play an important role in our marketing efforts 
government regulations each company operated and franchised restaurant must comply with regulations adopted by federal agencies and with licensing and other regulations enforced by state and local health  sanitation  safety  fire and other departments 
in addition  these restaurants must comply with federal and state environmental regulations  but those regulations have not had a material effect on the restaurants operations 
stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to cke restaurants  inc 
zoning  land use and environmental factors can delay and sometimes prevent development of new restaurants and remodeling of existing restaurants in particular locations 
we are also subject to federal laws and a substantial number of state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises 
such laws impose registration and disclosure requirements on franchisors in the offer and sale of franchises and may include substantive standards regarding the relationship between franchisor and franchisee  including limitations on the ability of franchisors to terminate franchise agreements or otherwise alter franchise arrangements 
we believe we are operating in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing our franchise operations 
we  and our franchisees  must comply with the fair labor standards act and various federal and state laws governing employment matters  such as minimum wages  overtime pay practices  child labor laws and other working conditions and citizenship requirements 
many of our employees are paid hourly rates related to the federal and state minimum wage laws and  accordingly  increases in the minimum wage increase our labor costs 
the company monitors its facilities for compliance with the americans with disabilities act ada in order to conform to its requirements 
under the ada  the company could be required to expend funds to modify its restaurants to better provide service to  or make reasonable accommodation for the employment of  disabled persons 
we believe that such expenditures  if required  would not have material adverse effect on the company s operations 
environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws 
these laws govern discharges to air and water from our restaurants  as well as handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes 
these laws may impose liability for damages from and the costs of cleaning up sites of spills  disposals or other releases of hazardous materials 
we may be responsible for environmental conditions relating to our restaurants and the land on which our restaurants are located  regardless of whether we lease or own the restaurants or land in question and regardless of whether such environmental conditions were created by us or by a prior owner or tenant 
we cannot assure you that all such environmental conditions have been identified by us 
these conditions include the presence of asbestos containing materials  leaking underground storage tanks and on site spills 
further  certain properties formerly had landfills  historic industrial use  gasoline stations and or dry cleaning businesses located on or near the premises 
corrective action  as required by the regulatory agencies  has been undertaken at some of the sites  although the majority of these sites are being remediated by former landowners or tenants 
the enforcement of our rights against third parties for environmental conditions  such as off site sources of contamination  may result in additional transaction costs for us 
seasonal operations our operations  particularly those of the hardee s brand  are seasonal in nature and subject to disruption from severe weather 
government contracts no material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the us government 
research and development we operate a research and development facility in california 
while research and development activities are important to our business  these expenditures are not material 
backlog our company operated restaurants and our distribution centers have no material backlog orders 
cke restaurants  inc 
employees we employ approximately  persons  primarily in restaurants we own and operate and also in our corporate offices and distribution facilities 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage attributable to labor disputes 
past attempts to unionize our distribution center employees have been rejected by employee votes 
we believe our employee relations are good 
working capital practices information about our liquidity is contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the years ended january   and in part ii  item  pages through  and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended january   and in part ii  item  page of this form k 
recent developments acquisition of santa barbara restaurant group on march   we acquired sbrg in a stock for stock exchange wherein each share of the common stock of sbrg was exchanged for shares of cke common stock 
we issued million cke shares in the merger in exchange for the sbrg shares  and issued million cke options in exchange for sbrg options and warrants  for an estimated purchase price of million 
sbrg owns  operates and franchises restaurants under the la salsa  timber lodge steakhouse and green burrito brand names 
the la salsa restaurants are quick service restaurants featuring traditional mexican food items 
the restaurants  modeled after taquerias of mexico  primarily cater to the lunch and dinner segment  and feature freshly prepared items such as tacos  burritos  taquitos and quesadillas 
the green burrito restaurants feature a menu of traditional mexican food items including burritos  tostadas  enchiladas  tacos  gorditas  chile rellenos  tortilla soup  appetizers and non alcoholic mexican drinks 
timber lodge steakhouse restaurants offer consistently high quality traditional american meals at moderate prices and in generous portions 
each timber lodge steakhouse incorporates a north woods theme with its log framed interior  fireplaces  hardwood floors and wood tables  chairs and booths  all of which help to create a cozy feeling of dining in a warm comfortable north woods log cabin 
we believe the sbrg acquisition is a strategic acquisition for us and will provide us with benefits that include control of the green burrito brand and the opportunity to enter the fresh mex segment of the qsr industry through the established la salsa brand 
amended credit facility on january   we amended our revolving credit facility to replace our existing million  which expired on february  the amended facility amounts to million 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the terms

risk factors we are engaged in a business turnaround at the company 
the success of a business turnaround  by its very nature  involves a significant number or risks  many of which are discussed below our ability to pursue new business opportunities  remodel older restaurants and open new restaurants  which are necessary in order to remain competitive and grow  may be impacted by the fact that we are a highly leveraged company as of the end of the fiscal year  our outstanding indebtedness  including capital leases  was million 
our debt level may restrict the pursuit of new opportunities such as business acquisitions 
our substantial indebtedness requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  which may prevent us from pursuing plans to open new restaurants and make other capital expenditures necessary to remain competitive in the qsr segment 
for instance  the principal measure of success in the qsr segment is same store sales 
remodeling older restaurants is an effective way to stimulate sales 
if we are required to divert cash flow to repayment of debt from the remodeling of older restaurants  as well as opening new restaurants  our future profitability would be adversely affected 
failure to maintain certain financial ratios could cause us to violate the terms of our credit facility and thereby result in acceleration of our indebtedness  impair our liquidity and limit our ability to operate 
our failure to make required debt payments could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness  in which case the lenders would be entitled to exercise their remedies 
our highly leveraged status may prevent us from accessing credit or equity markets at favorable terms to address future financing needs 
the lack of availability of financing to us may prevent us from implementing growth plans or proceeding with operational improvement initiatives  which may place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 
additionally  because we are highly leveraged  it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt securities  senior credit facility and other indebtedness 
our future success may be affected by our ability to revitalize hardee s we have been challenged by our efforts to reestablish the connection between hardee s and consumers 
our efforts have included new marketing strategies  remodeling restaurants  refranchising restaurants  product variety  use of discounting and a focus on the fundamentals quality  service and cleanliness 
although hardee s has experienced three consecutive quarters of positive same store sales  hardee s is an under performing brand 
failure to further revitalize the brand may have a significant negative effect on our success 
our success may be dependent on our franchisees participation in our strategy our franchisees are an integral part of our business 
we may be unable to successfully implement our brand strategies if our franchisees do not participate in that implementation 
the failure of our franchisees to continue to focus on the fundamentals of restaurant operations quality  service and cleanliness may have a negative impact on our success 
our financial results may be affected by our franchisees we receive revenue from our franchisees 
our financial results are somewhat contingent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees  including implementation of our strategic plans  as well as their ability to secure adequate financing 
if sales trends economic conditions worsen for our franchisees  their financial health may worsen  our collection cke restaurants  inc 
rates may decline and we may be required to assume the responsibility for additional lease payments on franchised restaurants 
additionally  refusal on the part of franchisees to renew their franchise agreements may result in decreased revenues 
entering into restructured franchise agreements may result in reduced franchise royalty rates in the future 
our business may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions and increased operating costs adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition recently  the united states of america has experienced an economic downturn 
when the american consumer has more to spend  restaurant trends are positively impacted  especially the qsr segment  as it is a cash market 
because of the relatively low average guest check in the qsr segment  approximately  the qsr has historically attracted consumers that are either lower income and or pressed for time 
due to the low average check  the qsr segment is relatively recession resistant 
however  if the national trend were to be a severe economic downturn  the resulting impact on our customers disposable incomes would have a negative impact on our sales 
our profitability could also be negatively impacted if we face increased costs for food  fuel  utilities  wages  clothing and equipment  and are unable to recover them through price increases 
our business depends on our ability to obtain commodities operation of our restaurants requires the purchase of energy and agriculture products 
occasionally  the availability of such commodities is limited due to circumstances beyond our control 
if we are unable to obtain such products we may be unable to offer certain products 
also  if the cost of such commodities increases we may be unable to implement appropriate price increases 
our success depends on our ability to compete with our competitors the foodservice industry is intensely competitive with respect to the quality and value of food products offered  concept  service  price  dining experience and location 
we compete with major restaurant chains  some of whom dominate the quick service restaurant industry 
our competitors also include a variety of mid price  full service casual dining restaurants  health and nutrition oriented restaurants  delicatessens and prepared food restaurants  as well as supermarkets and convenience stores 
many of our competitors have substantially greater brand recognition and financial  marketing  operating and other resources than we have  which may give them competitive advantages 
our competitors could also make changes to pricing or other marketing strategies that may impact us 
as our competitors expand operations  we expect competition to intensify 
such increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our business depends on our suppliers abilities to provide quality products to us timely 
our profitability is dependent upon  among other things  our ability to offer fresh  high quality food at moderate prices 
while we continue to operate our own distribution business for most of our carl s jr 
system  we rely upon independent distributors for our hardee s restaurants 
in particular  our hardee s restaurants depend on the distribution services of two distributors  mbm corporation  mbm an independent supplier and distributor of food and other products  and fast food merchandisers  inc ffm  which mbm recently acquired 
mbm and ffm are responsible for delivering food  paper and other products from our vendors to our hardee s restaurants on a regular basis 
mbm and ffm also provide distribution services to a large number of our hardee s franchisees 
any disruption in these distribution services could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our dependence on frequent deliveries of food and paper products subjects our restaurants to the risk that shortages or interruptions in supply  caused by adverse weather or other conditions  could adversely affect the availability  quality and cost of ingredients 
given recent events regarding livestock diseases in various parts of the world  it is possible that the production and supply of beef could be negatively impacted in the future 
a reduction in the supply of beef could have a material effect on the price at which it could be obtained  which could have a material negative impact on our results 
our business may be significantly impacted by consumer preferences and perceptions foodservice businesses are often affected by changes in consumer tastes and perceptions 
traffic patterns and demographics  as well as the type  number and locations of competing restaurants may adversely affect the performance of individual restaurants 
multi unit foodservice businesses such as ours can also be materially and adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality  illness  injury or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants 
we can be similarly affected by consumer concerns with respect to the nutritional value of quick service food 
cke restaurants  inc 
unfavorable trends or developments concerning factors such as inflation  increased food  labor and employee benefit costs including increases in hourly wage and unemployment tax rates  increases in the number of locations of competing quick service restaurants  regional weather conditions and the availability of experienced management and hourly employees may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our business may suffer due to our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel or if labor costs continue to increase until recently  the united states of america has experienced reduced levels of unemployment 
given that our restaurant level workforce requires large numbers of both entry level and skilled employees  low levels of unemployment could compromise our ability to provide quality service in our restaurants 
from time to time  we have had difficulty hiring and maintaining qualified restaurant management personnel 
increases in the minimum wage have impacted our labor costs 
due to the labor intensive nature of our business  a continued shortage of labor or increases in wage levels could have a negative effect on our results of operations 
our sales and profits may be materially and adversely affected by our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions or mergers or derive the benefits we expect out future results of operations and cash flow may depend in part upon our ability to integrate acquisitions and mergers such as the acquisition of sbrg 
if we are unable to achieve the strategic operating objectives we anticipate from such acquisitions we may experience increased costs or decreased sales which would have a negative impact on our results from operations 
strategic operating initiatives that we may be unable to achieve include  economies of scale in operations  cost reduction  sales increases or marketing initiatives 
the recoverability of the goodwill expected to arise from the acquisition  approximately million as disclosed in the joint proxy statement prospectus dated january   is dependent upon the ability of sbrg to operate profitably 
our business may be impacted by increased insurance costs in the past we have been negatively affected by increases in both workers compensation insurance and general liability insurance due to our claims experience and rising healthcare costs 
although we seek to manage our claims to prevent increases  such increases can occur unexpectedly and without regard to our efforts to limit them 
if such increases occur  we may be unable to pass them along to the consumer through product price increases  resulting in decreased income 
our operations are seasonal and heavily influenced by weather conditions weather  which is unpredictable  can impact our sales 
harsh weather conditions that keep customers from dining out result in lost opportunities for our restaurants 
a heavy snowstorm can leave an entire metropolitan area snowbound  resulting in a reduction in sales 
our first and fourth quarters  notably the fourth quarter  include winter months when there is historically a lower level of sales 
because a significant portion of our restaurant operating costs is fixed or semi fixed in nature  the loss of sales during these periods adversely impacts our operating margins  resulting in restaurant operating losses 
these adverse  weather driven events principally arise at our hardee s restaurants 
for these reasons  a quarter to quarter comparison is not a good indication of our performance or how we may perform in the future 
our financial results may be impacted by our ability to construct new restaurants or complete remodels in recent years  we have not opened a significant number of new restaurants as all available cash was used to repay bank indebtedness 
our strategic plan  and a component of our business turnaround  includes the construction of new restaurants and the remodeling of existing restaurants  including the installation of charbroilers 
the company and its franchisees face competition from other restaurants operators  retail chains  companies and developers for desirable site locations  which may adversely affect the cost  implementation and timing of the company s expansion plans 
if we experience delays in the construction process we may be unable to complete such construction activities at the planned cost  thereby adversely affecting our future results from operations 
additionally  there can be no assurance that such remodels and conversions will increase the revenues generated by these restaurants or  even if revenues are initially increased  that such increases will be sustainable 
likewise  we cannot be sure that the sites we select for new restaurants will indeed result in restaurants whose sales results meet our expectations 
our business may be affected by unfavorable outcomes on litigation 
as discussed below under the heading item legal proceedings  we have thousands of interactions and transactions each day with vendors  franchisees  customers  employees and others 
in the ordinary course of business  disputes may arise for a number of reasons 
we cannot be certain that we will prevail in every action brought against us 
cke restaurants  inc 
our business is subject to requirements imposed by governmental regulations or interpretation of governmental regulations may change and require us to incur substantial expenditures to comply we are subject to governmental regulation at the federal  state and local level in many areas of our business  such as food safety and sanitation  the sale of alcoholic beverages  environmental issues and minimum wage 
while we endeavor to comply with all applicable laws and regulations  governmental units may make changes in the regulatory frameworks that we operate in that may require us to incur substantial cost increases in order to comply with such laws and regulations 
while we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations  we cannot assure you that we are in full compliance with all laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws or regulations 
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we may be subject to sanctions or civil remedies  including fines and injunctions 
the cost of compliance or the consequences of non compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our operations are regulated by environmental laws we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws 
these laws govern discharges to air and water  as well as handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes 
these laws may also impose liability for damages from and the costs of cleaning up sites of spills  disposals or other releases of hazardous materials 
we may be responsible for environmental conditions relating to our restaurants and the land on which our restaurants are located  regardless of whether we lease or own the restaurant or land in question and regardless of whether such environmental conditions were created by us or by a prior owner or tenant 
although we are not aware of any such conditions  the costs of such cleanup could be significant have a material effect on our financial results

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and selected financial and operating data included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a nationwide owner  operator and franchisor of quick service restaurants  operating principally under the carl s jr 
and hardee s brand names 
based on domestic systemwide sales  our hardee s and carl s jr 
chains are the seventh and eleventh largest quick service hamburger restaurant chains in the united states  respectively according to finance corporation of america s chain restaurant industry review and outlook report  based on system wide sales 
as of january   the carl s jr 
system included restaurants  of which we operated restaurants and our franchisees and licensees operated restaurants 
the carl s jr 
restaurants are located in the western united states  predominantly in california 
as of january   the hardee s system consisted of  restaurants  of which we operated restaurants and our franchisees and licensees operated  restaurants 
hardee s restaurants are located primarily throughout the southeastern and midwestern united states 
we derive our revenue primarily from sales by company operated restaurants and revenue from franchisees  including franchise and royalty fees  sales to carl s jr 
franchisees and licensees of food and packaging products  rentals under real property leases and revenue from the sale of equipment to our franchisees 
restaurant operating expenses consist primarily of food and packaging costs  payroll and other employee benefits and occupancy and other operating expenses of company operated restaurants 
operating costs of our franchised and licensed restaurants include the cost of food and packaging products sold to carl s jr 
s franchisees and licensees  lease payments on properties subleased to our franchisees and the costs of equipment purchases 
other operating expenses  including advertising expenses and general and administrative expenses  relate to company operated restaurants as well as franchisee and licensee operations 
our revenue and expenses are directly affected by the number and sales volume of company operated restaurants and  to a lesser extent  franchised and licensed restaurants 
factors affecting comparability of fiscal years  and our fiscal year results in a fifty third week every fifth or sixth year

our results reflect the substantial changes we have made in executing our business turnaround including the sale and closure of restaurants  the reduction of corporate overhead and our efforts to improve margins and repay down bank indebtedness 
the table below is a condensed presentation of those activities  and other changes in the components of income  designed to facilitate the discussion of results in this form k 
as shown  the sale and closure of restaurants involved in facility actions caused a reduction in operating earnings of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
these amounts include field level general and administrative expenses 
in order to sell restaurants to franchisees to generate funds to repay bank indebtedness  we had to sell restaurants that generated positive cash flows 
the bulk of these sales occurred in fiscal and  accordingly  the disposition of these restaurants resulted in a reduction of operating income 
additionally  we closed more unprofitable restaurants in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
all amounts are approximate and in millions fiscal year vs 
fiscal year fiscal year vs

restaurant portfolio strategy as described above  in late fiscal we embarked on a re franchising initiative to generate cash to reduce outstanding borrowings on our senior credit facility  as well as increase the number of franchise operated restaurants 
additionally  as sales trends for the hardee s restaurants and certain carl s jr 
restaurants primarily in the oklahoma area continued to decline in fiscal through fiscal  we determined that it was necessary to close certain restaurants for which a return to profitability was not likely 
these repositioning activities resulted in the charges generally reflected in our financial statements as facility action charges 
we have made reductions to operating expenses in an effort to bring them to levels commensurate with our re balanced restaurant portfolio 
during fiscal  we recorded repositioning charges of million 
these charges  which were primarily non cash in nature  consisted of net facility action charges of  a charge of million recorded as interest expense reflecting the write off of deferred loan costs as a result of modification of our credit facility and million relating to severance costs 
during fiscal and  we recorded repositioning charges of million and million  respectively  relating primarily to facility action charges 
we believe we have substantially completed our repositioning activities and are now able to focus on the operations of our core brands  carl s jr 
and hardee s 
we have substantially completed the closure of under performing restaurants 
however  there can be no guarantee that we will not determine in the future that additional repositioning activities will be necessary or that we would not take advantage of opportunities to further improve our financial position through additional restaurant asset sales which could result in losses  which may be material 
our management team remains focused on revitalizing hardee s 
even though hardee s has experienced three consecutive quarters of same store sales increases this year for the first time in many years see discussion below  hardee s is still an under performing brand 
in june  we took a more basic approach to addressing the issues in the hardee s restaurants and launched a program focused on quality  service and cleanliness 
that program focuses on the fundamentals of restaurant operations hiring good people  focusing them on the guests  serving hot quality food  and keeping the restaurants clean 
we have returned to salaried managers running the restaurants  which provides an extra manager to hire  train and manage our workforce 
we have implemented a new incentive compensation plan to focus our operators on building sales  providing service to our guests and reducing work injuries 
additionally  we have acknowledged regional differences by adjusting product promotions and advertising to a regional scope 
the continuation of our business turnaround is based on the following next steps re define the hardee s brand image so that we re connect with today s customer  deliver premium products to our customers  contain costs  grow our brands  integrate the sbrg brands lasalsa  green burrito and timber lodge  and continue our focus on improving our restaurant operations so that each restaurant visit is a satisfying one for our customers 
if we are unable to continue the recent sales and operating margin improvements at hardee s  it would significantly affect our future profitability and cash flows 
such circumstances would affect our ability to access both the amount and terms of financing available to us in the future  see financial condition section below 
cke restaurants  inc 
the asset sales arising from our repositioning activities have resulted  and will continue to result  in a decline in restaurant revenue and costs simply because we operate fewer restaurants 
additionally  we expect the closure of unprofitable restaurants to improve our future overall profit margin 
the following table summarizes the historical operating results of restaurants that we sold  closed or identified to be closed fiscal year fiscal year dollars in thousands no

as a result of these circumstances  we have reduced costs  principally general and administrative expenses  which included a reduction in headcount as well as other expenses 
franchise operations from time to time  some of our franchise operators experience financial difficulties with respect to their franchise operations 
a number of franchise operators in the hardee s system have experienced significant financial problems 
we are working with them in an attempt to maximize our future franchising income 
during the fourth quarter  we recorded a charge of approximately million related to one of those franchisees who is closing about restaurants subleased to him by hardee s 
we also recorded bad debt expense related to the another franchisee who is experiencing financial difficulties and we believe may be unable to repay its note to us 
there are a number of courses of action available in these situations 
they include  but are not limited to  a sale of some or all of the franchise operator s restaurants to us or another hardee s franchisee  a modification to the franchise agreement which may include a provision for reduced royalty rates in the future if royalty rates are not sufficient to cover our costs of service over the life of the franchise agreement we record the estimated loss at the time we modify the agreement  a restructuring of the franchisee s business and or finances  or  if necessary  a termination of the franchise agreement 
we have increased the allowance for doubtful accounts at hardee s from of the gross balance of accounts and notes receivable at the beginning of the year to at the end of the year 
on a quarterly basis  we assess our exposure from franchise related risks  which include estimated uncollectibility of accounts receivable related to unpaid royalties and advertising fees  contingent lease liabilities  guarantees to support certain third party financial arrangements with franchisees and potential claims by franchisees 
although the ultimate impact of these franchise financial issues cannot be predicted with certainty at this time  we have provided for the current estimate of our probable loss as of january  however  there can be no assurance that the number of franchise operators or franchised restaurants experiencing financial difficulties will not change from our current estimates  nor can there be any assurance that we will be successful in resolving financial issues relating to any specific franchise operator

our franchise agreements typically have terms of years 
we are now beginning to see agreements come up for renewal 
there are carl s jr 
franchise agreements  pertaining to restaurants  maturing during the next year 
additionally  there are hardee s franchise agreements  pertaining to restaurants  maturing during the same period 
in the event those agreements are not renewed  we would suffer a loss of revenue 
the discussion of our financial condition and our results of operations that follows is based on the consolidated financial statements as presented on pages through fourth quarter adjustments during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded facility action charges of million 
these charges consisted of a an impairment charge of million  b store closure expense and goodwill impairment of million for hardee s restaurants formerly operated by a franchisee and for which the we are the primary obligor on the leases  and c net gains on the sale of restaurants to franchisees and surplus properties of million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded facility action charges of million 
these charges  which were primarily non cash in nature  consisted of a a million restaurant closure reserve for approximately hardee s and approximately carl s jr

carl s jr 
company operated restaurants average unit volumes were million for the trailing thirteen periods ended january  net franchising income increased million or during fiscal  as compared to the fiscal year and million or when comparing fiscal to this increase is due primarily to increased royalties from the sale of restaurants to franchisees and lower administrative costs 
restaurant level margins for our company operated carl s jr 
restaurants were during fiscal  a slight increase from the operating margin achieved during fiscal the increase in margins is due to i decreased food and packaging costs  which were down during fiscal as compared to fiscal  from to as a percentage of company operated restaurant revenue  ii an increase in payroll and other employee benefits  which increased in the current year as compared to the prior year  from to as a percentage of company operated restaurant revenue  and iii flat occupancy and other expense 
the decrease in food and packaging is primarily due to a shift in focus to high margin  premium products 
the slight increase in payroll and other employee benefits is due to a mid year increase in the minimum wage rate in california and washington that was partially offset by lower workers compensation costs 
occupancy and other operating expenses remained flat because reduced depreciation levels due to cumulative asset impairment charges reducing the depreciable base of restaurants this year and a reduction in restaurant operating costs due to renegotiated service contracts  which were offset by higher repair and maintenance costs 
carl s jr 
fiscal company operated restaurant level margins were lower than fiscal food and packaging costs increased  mainly due to increases in certain commodity costs during the year primarily beef and bacon and the introduction of a plastic cup that has a higher cost than the traditional paper cup 
payroll and employee benefit expenses increased  primarily due to an increase in the actuarially determined liability for our workers compensation program and a tighter labor market 
occupancy and other operating expenses increased  which was attributable to increased energy costs in california and higher rent costs arising from sales leaseback transactions 
currently  the legislature of the state of california is considering a bill which  if passed by two thirds majorities in both california s senate and assembly  would implement a surtax of per gallon of beverage syrup and cents per gallon for bottled  canned or reconstituted drinks sold in california 
we have not determined the financial impact that passage of this bill would have on our business

hardee s during fiscal  we acquired restaurants from franchisees  sold to franchisees and closed restaurants 
hardee s franchisees and licensees opened new restaurants  acquired restaurants from us  sold to us and closed as of january   the hardee s system consisted of the following restaurant portfolio fiscal year revenue dollars in millions change company franchise and licensed total revenue from company operated hardee s restaurants decreased million  or  to million for the year ended january   when compared to the prior year  and decreased million  or when comparing fiscal to fiscal the decrease in revenue for both time periods is due primarily to the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees  as well as the closure of certain underperforming company operated restaurants 
the table above provides a comparison of the number of company operated restaurants at the end of fiscal year and with the revenue earned 
same store sales during fiscal for company operated hardee s restaurants increased during the current year and hardee s company operated restaurant average unit volumes were  for the trailing thirteen periods 
during fiscal  company operated hardee s restaurants had same store sales decline and average unit volumes of  net franchising income decreased million or during fiscal  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
this decrease is due primarily to the decreased revenue at hardee s equipment division because franchisees remodeled more restaurants in fiscal than they did in fiscal and the fact that the increased royalties we received from new franchisees in the current year was less than the franchise fees we received last year when we were selling restaurants 
during fiscal  hardee s net franchising income increased million  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the increased number of company operated restaurants sold to franchisees 
restaurant level margins for company operated hardee s restaurants increased during fiscal  when measured as a percentage of company operated restaurant revenue  from to 
food and packaging costs decreased 
payroll and other employee benefits decreased in the current year 
occupancy and other operating expenses decreased in the current year 
our improved margin was due to the closing of unprofitable restaurants  a focus on premium products and less discounting  improved self insurance claims management  and reduced comparative deprecation levels due to a reduced depreciable base of restaurants  partially offset by increased repair and maintenance expenses to improve the visual appeal of our restaurants 
during fiscal  hardee s company operated restaurant margins decreased from to 
our fixed and semi fixed costs  as a percentage of revenue vary greatly with changes in restaurant sales 
as same store sales decline at hardee s  fixed and semi fixed costs such as rent and restaurant management represent a higher percentage of revenue even though the dollar amount remains relatively the same 
taco bueno taco bueno s restaurant level operating margins were in fiscal  a decline from fiscal in fiscal  restaurant level operating margins were  a decrease of from fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due to increased food and paper costs  partially offset by lower occupancy and other expenses 
the decrease in margins during fiscal was a result of increased labor costs resulting from a tight labor market in texas and oklahoma  as well as an increase in the workers compensation insurance reserve due to an actuarially determined liability 
taco bueno was sold during the second quarter of fiscal see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the sale of the taco bueno brand has and will continue to result in less operating income than reported in prior periods 
cke restaurants  inc 
other consolidated expenses advertising expenses decreased million  or  to million during fiscal advertising expenses  as a percentage of company operated revenue  have decreased slightly from to 
this is due to the enhanced commercial production cost management and more effective utilization of point of purchase sales materials 
during fiscal year  advertising expenses decreased million  or as compared to fiscal year  due to significantly higher expenditures for special advertising campaigns during fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased million or year ended january   as compared to the prior fiscal year and were of total revenue 
this decrease is primarily due to lower corporate and field salaries due to a decrease in headcount this year  as well as reduced consulting and professional service expenses  which were partially offset by increased relocation costs due to the completion of the relocation of hardee s corporate offices to st 
louis  missouri and the relocation of our executive offices to santa barbara  california 
this decline from the prior year is consistent with our goal to have general and administrative expenses be commensurate with our mix of company operated and franchise operated restaurants 
during fiscal  general and administrative expenses decreased million or and were of total revenue  compared to of total revenue during fiscal the increase as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the fact that our costs in fiscal had not declined as quickly as our revenue had  and that we incurred added contract labor during the first two quarters of fiscal relating to information technology support and depreciation on computer systems that were installed in the prior year 
additionally  in the early part of fiscal  we incurred significant recruiting expenses to fill open positions 
prior to filling these positions  temporary labor was used to fill these vacancies 
we also incurred million of charges  in fiscal  including a million of restructuring charges in connection with consolidating certain administrative functions from rocky mount  north carolina to anaheim  california  b million of yk expenses associated with restaurant computer systems  c million in capitalized software development costs which were written off because they will not by utilized  d million in additional vacation expense in connection with a change in our vacation policy  e offset by million gain on the sale of an aircraft that we acquired in connection with the original hardee s acquisition  and f million in other miscellaneous items 
in november  we decided that we would consolidated the majority of the corporate functions of our hardee s subsidiary  located in rocky mount  north carolina  within our corporate headquarters in anaheim  california  creating a single support and administrative center for our carl s jr  hardee s and taco bueno restaurants 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we incurred a charge of million of termination benefits for approximately employees that were laid off during fiscal interest expense interest expense for fiscal decreased million or as compared with fiscal this decrease was due to lower levels of borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility throughout the fiscal year 
during fiscal  we had increased levels of borrowing on our senior credit facility and incurred an entire year of interest expense on our million  senior subordinated notes  while in fiscal  we incurred only a partial year of interest expense as the notes were issued during fiscal other income expense  net other income expense  net  mainly consists of interest income  lease income from parties other than franchisees  dividend income  income  gain and loss on long term investments  and net property management income for sites leased to third parties 
other income expense  net was an expense of  in fiscal other income expense  net in fiscal was an expense of million 
the decreased net expense in fiscal was primarily due to the recognition of a million gain on sale of long term investments 
in fiscal  we had other net expense of million  which consists primarily of a recording an impairment charge and our equity in the operating losses of our investments of million to write down our investments in checkers  sbrg  and boston west to fair market value based upon our conclusion that these investments had experienced an other than temporary decline in value  and b writing off approximately million of hardee s acquisition related assets which we believe had no future benefit

income taxes as a result of our net operating losses in fiscal and  we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million for all of our net deferred tax asset at january  while we have been able to carryback approximately million of these losses against amounts previously paid  we have provided a valuation allowance for the remaining net operating loss carryforward as well as the net deferred tax asset that existed at the beginning of the fiscal year at january    the company had a federal net operating loss nol carryforward of approximately million  expiring in varying amounts in the years through and various state nol carryforwards in varying amounts expiring in the years through additionally  the company has an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately million and general business credit carryforwards expiring in varying amounts in the years through and foreign tax credits which expire in varying amounts in the years through in fiscal  we recorded income tax at the statutory rates 
we expect to receive a million income tax refund in the first quarter of fiscal year this refund results from the nol carryback of our fiscal year operating loss 
we paid alternative minimum tax on our fiscal year results and will now receive a refund of that tax 
extraordinary item during the third quarter of fiscal  our board of directors approved the buyback of up to million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes 
in fiscal  we repurchased million of such notes for million in cash  including accrued interest thereon 
in connection with this repurchase  we recognized an extraordinary gain on the early retirement of debt of  net of applicable income taxes of  for fiscal new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations sfas which supersedes apb opinion no 
 business combinations 
sfas eliminates the pooling of interest methods of accounting for business combinations and modifies the application of the purchase accounting method 
sfas also specifies criteria intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
the provisions of sfas were effective for transactions accounted for using the purchase method that were completed after june  we have used the purchase method for all previous acquisitions and will do so for the acquisition of sbrg see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in  the fasb also issued sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which supercedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
sfas requires that goodwill and other intangible assets be reported separately  eliminates the requirement to amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  addresses the amortization of intangible assets with a defined life  and addresses impairment testing and recognition for goodwill and intangible assets 
sfas applies to goodwill and intangible assets arising from transactions completed before and after its effective date 
sfas is effective for the company for fiscal year sfas changes the method of accounting for the recoverability of goodwill such that  for the company  it will be evaluated at the brand level  based upon the estimated fair value of the brand 
currently  we allocate goodwill to each restaurant and  we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill on a restaurant by restaurant basis 
under the sfas  the valuation methodology is significantly different and could result in a substantial write down of the recorded goodwill 
the impairment review will involve a two step process as follows step compare the fair value for each brand to its carrying value  including goodwill 
for each brand where the carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the brand s fair value  move on to step if a brand s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step allocate the fair value of the brand to its identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this will derive an implied fair value for the brand s goodwill 
then  compare the implied fair value of the reporting brand s goodwill with the carrying amount of reporting brand s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting brand s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess 
cke restaurants  inc 
we have not finalized our evaluation of adopting sfas  but do know that approximately million of goodwill amortization will no longer be recorded as amortization expense in general and administrative costs 
we expect upon adoption of this pronouncement that a significant goodwill impairment charge relating to our hardee s brand will be recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the first quarter of fiscal in  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  which will be effective for the company in the first quarter of fiscal year sfas addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs

sfas will be effective for the company in the first quarter of fiscal we have not yet determined the impact of adopting sfas no

impact of inflation inflation has an impact on food  construction  occupancy  labor and benefit costs  all of which can significantly affect our operations 
historically  consistent with the industry  we have been able to pass along to our customers higher costs arising from these inflationary factors seasonality our business is affected by seasonality 
average restaurant sales are normally higher in the summer months than during the winter months for each of our restaurant concepts 
in comparison with our carl s jr 
restaurant concept  the weather has a greater impact on average restaurant sales at our hardee s restaurants  because a significant number of them are located in rural areas that experience severe winter conditions without the benefit of municipal storm services typical of more urban areas 
competition as discussed previously in item business  the foodservice industry is intensively competitive with respect to several factors 
we compete with a variety of foodservice companies 
because our competition is a diverse group major restaurant chains  casual dining restaurants  nutrition oriented restaurants and prepared food stores  it is difficult for us to attribute specific results of operations to the actions of any of our competitors 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources free cash flow cash provided by operations less capital expenditures for fiscal was million 
free cash flow  together with proceeds from asset sales  was used primarily to pay back borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
for the year  we generated cash flows from operations of million  as compared to million during fiscal this increase was due to improved operations  as well as the receipt of an income tax refund of approximately million 
investing activities generated million primarily from asset sales 
financing activities used million primarily to pay down our senior credit facility 
cash and cash equivalents increased million to million in fiscal earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges by million 
excluding the effect of the repositioning charges discussed above  earnings would be insufficient to cover fixed charges by million see exhibit 
as discussed above  in fiscal year  we embarked on an asset sale program designed to generate cash to reduce indebtedness under our senior credit facility 
during fiscal  we made a net repayment on our revolving credit facility of approximately million  of which approximately million was provided by cash proceeds from assets sales including million from the sale of taco bueno 
the balance of the repayment was generated from operations 
in fiscal  we repurchased million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes for million in cash  including accrued interest thereon 
we recognized an extraordinary gain on the early retirement of debt of  net of applicable taxes of  for fiscal cke restaurants  inc 
on march   we completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due we received net proceeds of million  of which million was used to repay outstanding term loan balances under our senior credit facility 
the indenture relating to the senior subordinated notes imposes certain restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness including  but not limited to  indebtedness under the credit facility  indebtedness to refinance existing debt  which must become subordinate to these notes  and indebtedness required in the ordinary course of business pay dividends on  redeem or repurchase our capital stock  make restricted payments as defined in the agreement in excess of million as of january  we have made approximately million in restricted payments  make investments  incur liens on our assets  sell assets other than in the ordinary course of business  or enter into certain transactions with our affiliates 
the senior subordinated notes represent unsecured general obligations subordinate in right of payment to our senior indebtedness  including our senior credit facility 
we amended and restated our senior facility on january   securing a million lender s commitment under a revolving credit facility 
the amended facility includes a letter of credit sub facility  and changed the maturity date to december   extendable to november   provided we are able to earlier refinance our convertible subordinated notes due march the credit facility is collateralized by all of our personal property assets and certain restaurant property deeds of trust with a carrying value of million as of january  the amended and restated credit facility  which may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including permitted investments and acquisitions  includes the following features among others we are permitted to spend on targeted restaurant development as specified in our strategic plan 
we are permitted to divest restaurants not in the collateral pool  to balance our portfolio or achieve strategic direction  and invest the proceeds back into the business 
we are restricted from incurring new indebtedness 
the interest rate under the facility is the lower of libor or prime  plus applicable margins based on our leverage ratio 
we are allowed to repurchase up to million of convertible subordinated notes 
we are prohibited from repurchasing our common stock 
we must comply with specified covenants including minimum ebitda  fixed charges coverage  and consolidated tangible net worth and maximum leverage ratios 
during the last three years  we sold approximately carl s jr 
restaurants to franchisees  generating net cash proceeds as defined in the company s senior credit facility of approximately million  and approximately hardee s restaurants to franchisees  generating net cash proceeds of approximately million 
this strategy was intended to generate cash to pay down borrowings under our senior credit facility  and to allow us to focus on running the balance of our hardee s system with a smaller number of company operated restaurants 
the quick service restaurant business generally receives simultaneous cash payment for sales 
we presently use the net cash flow from operations to repay outstanding indebtedness and to reinvest in long term assets  primarily for the remodeling and construction of restaurants 
normal operating expenses for inventories and current liabilities generally carry longer payment terms usually to days 
as a result  we typically maintain current liabilities in excess of current assets 
we believe that cash generated from our various restaurant operations and the cash and cash equivalents on hand as of january   and amounts available under our senior credit facility  will provide the funds necessary to meet all of our capital spending and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
under our amended credit facility  we have million of outstanding letters of credit at january  and  as we had not borrowed on the facility at that date  we had million available for our use 
subsequent to the end of fiscal year january   we began repurchasing convertible notes under the terms provided in our amended credit facility 
the new facility allows us to repurchase up to million of convertible notes 
through march   we repurchased million face value of convertible notes for million  at various prices ranging from to 
those transactions resulted in recognition of a gain on retirement of debt of million  which will be recognized in the first quarter of fiscal year cke restaurants  inc 
the repurchase of convertible debt subsequent to the end of the fiscal year was the first step in addressing our plan to begin developing a strategy for retiring our maturing million of convertible notes  due march strategies we may consider include the sale of assets including restaurants  a debt or equity offering  a debt swap or some combination of those items 
in the event that we are unable to successfully implement one or more of those options  we may be required to sell additional restaurants at a loss to raise sufficient funds to retire the debt 
those losses may be material and have a significant negative impact on our operating results 
long term obligations the following table presents our long term contractual obligations contractual obligations payments due by periods dollars in thousands total less than one year years years after years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the amounts reported above as operating leases and capital lease obligations include leases contained in the restaurant closure reserve and leases for which we are the obligee to the property owner and sublease to franchisees 
additional information regarding operating leases and capital lease obligations can be found in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
represents the undiscounted value of capital lease payments 
unconditional purchase obligations include contacts for goods and services  primarily related to restaurant operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our principal exposure to financial market risks is the impact that interest rate changes could have on our million senior credit facility  of which million was outstanding as of january  and as of april   we had million outstanding 
borrowings under our senior credit facility bear interest at the prime rate or at libor plus an applicable margin based on certain financial ratios averaging in fiscal 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in short term interest rates at fiscal year end would result in no reduction in annual pre tax earnings as no amounts were borrowed at that time 
the estimated reduction is based upon the outstanding balance of our senior credit facility and assumes no change in the volume  index or composition of debt at january  substantially all of our business is transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  foreign exchange rate fluctuations have never had a significant impact on us and are not expected to in the foreseeable future 
commodity price risk we purchase certain products which are affected by commodity prices and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  market conditions and other factors which are not considered predictable or within our control 
although many of the products purchased are subject to changes in commodity prices  certain purchasing contracts or pricing arrangements contain risk management techniques designed to minimize price volatility 
the purchasing contracts and pricing arrangements we use typically result in unconditional purchase obligations  which are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet 
as noted in the table above  our unconditional purchase obligations currently total million and are due at various dates during the next years 
typically  we use these types of purchasing techniques to control costs as an alternative to directly managing financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
in many cases  we believe we will be able to address commodity cost increases  which are significant and appear to be long term in nature by adjusting our menu pricing or changing our product delivery strategy 
however  increases in commodity prices could result in lower restaurant level operating margins for our restaurant concepts
