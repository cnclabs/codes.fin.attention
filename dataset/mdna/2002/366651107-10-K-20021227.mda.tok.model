business measures research revenues are derived from subscription contracts for research products 
revenues from research products are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract term 
consulting revenues are recognized primarily on a percentage of completion basis and on a time and materials basis as work is performed and services are provided on a contract by contract basis 
events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related symposium  conference or exhibition 
other revenues includes software licensing fees which are recognized when a signed non cancelable software license exists  delivery has occurred  collection is probable  and the fees are fixed or determinable 
revenue from software maintenance is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement  which is typically twelve months 
we believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments 
revenue category business measurements research contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscription related research products that recognize revenue on a ratable basis 
contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all subscription research contracts in effect at a specific point in time  without regard to the duration of the contract 
client retention rate represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business relationships at a specific point in time 
client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current clients who were also clients a year ago  by all clients from a year ago 
consulting consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from in process consulting  measurement and strategic advisory services engagements 
events deferred events revenue represents billings and relates directly to our future symposia  conferences and exhibitions 
events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related symposium  conference or exhibition 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results our quarterly and annual revenue and operating income fluctuate as a result of many factors  including the timing of the execution of research contracts  the extent of completion of consulting engagements  the timing of symposia and other events  which occur to a greater extent in the quarter ended december  the amount of new business generated  the mix of domestic and international business  changes in market demand for our products and services  the timing of the development  introduction and marketing of new products and services  and competition in the industry 
the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period to period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective judgements and estimates 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows o revenues from research products are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term  o consulting revenues are recognized primarily on a percentage of completion basis and on a time and materials basis as work is performed and services are provided on a contract by contract basis  o events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related symposium  conference or exhibition  and o other revenues  principally software licensing fees  are recognized when a signed non cancelable software license exists  delivery has occurred  collection is probable  and the fees are fixed or determinable 
uncollectible accounts receivable provisions for bad debts are recognized as incurred 
the measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is based on historical loss experience  aging of outstanding receivables  an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients 
this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires material estimates 
these valuation reserves are periodically re evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of accounts receivable becomes available 
circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality  other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due  and the quality of our collection efforts 
total trade receivables at september  were million  against which an allowance for losses of approximately million was provided 
total trade receivables at september  were million  against which an allowance for losses of approximately million was provided 
impairment of investment securities a charge to earnings is made when a market decline below cost is other than temporary 
management regularly reviews each investment security for impairment based on criteria that include the length of time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  the valuation of comparable companies and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
total investments in equity securities was million and million at september  and  respectively see note investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets the evaluation of goodwill is performed in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
among other requirements  this standard eliminated goodwill amortization upon adoption and required an initial assessment for goodwill impairment within six months of adoption and at least annually thereafter 
the evaluation of other intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis and losses are recorded when the assets carrying value is not recoverable through future cash flows 
these assessments require management to estimate future business operations and market and economic conditions in developing long term forecasts 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger a review for impairment include the following o significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  o significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  o significant negative industry or economic trends  o significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and o our market capitalization relative to net book value 
accounting for income taxes as we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and we establish a valuation allowance  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely 
contingencies and other loss reserves we establish reserves for severance costs  contract terminations and asset impairments as a result of actions we undertake to streamline our organization  reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs 
estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions  such as future lease payments  sublease income  the fair value of assets  and severance and related benefits  are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated 
to the extent actual costs differ from those estimates  reserve levels may need to be adjusted 
in addition  these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved

depreciation expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to the depreciation of significant capital expenditures in the previous year for internal use software development required to support the business and also due to the amortization of costs associated with the launch of gartner

these investments are comprised of early to mid stage it based or internet enabled companies 
we made an assessment of the carrying value of our investments and determined that certain investments were in excess of their fair value due to the significance and duration of the decline in valuation of comparable companies operating in the internet and technology sectors see note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the impairment factors evaluated by management may change in subsequent periods  given that the entities underlying these investments operate in a volatile business environment 
in addition  these entities may require additional financing to meet their cash and operational needs  however  there can be no assurance that such funds will be available to the extent needed  at terms acceptable to the entities  if at all 
this could result in additional material non cash impairment charges in the future

if we were to require substantial amounts of additional capital to pursue business opportunities that may arise involving substantial investments of additional capital  or for the possible redemption of the convertible notes  there can be no assurances that such capital will be available to us or will be available on commercially reasonable terms 
stock repurchases on july   our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to million of class a and class b common stock 
on july   the board of directors increased the authorized stock repurchase program to million of our class a and class b common stock 
we expect to make repurchases from time to time over the next two years through open market purchases  block trades or otherwise 
repurchases are subject to the availability of the stock  prevailing market conditions  the trading price of the stock  and our financial performance 
repurchases will be funded from cash flow from operations and possible borrowings under our existing credit facility 
through september   we repurchased  shares of our common stock for approximately million out of the million approved for the stock repurchase program at an average price of per share 
stock repurchases are summarized below total cost per total shares cost share fiscal recapitalization   fiscal recapitalization   stock repurchase program purchased from ims health  inc and affiliates on august    open market purchases   termination of forward purchase agreement total fiscal   fiscal stock repurchase program   represents cumulative repurchases pursuant to the million stock repurchase program   factors that may affect future results we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control 
in addition  our clients and we are affected by the economy 
the following section discusses many  but not all  of these risks and uncertainties 
economic conditions 
our revenues and results of operations are influenced by economic conditions in general and more particularly by business conditions in the it industry 
a general economic downturn or recession  anywhere in the world  could negatively effect demand for our products and services and may substantially reduce existing and potential client information technology related budgets 
the current economic downturn in the united states and globally has led to constrained it spending which has impacted our business and may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  including the ability to maintain continued customer renewals and achieve contract value  backlog and deferred events revenue 
to the extent our clients are in the it industry  the severe decline in that sector has also had a significant impact on it spending 
acts of terrorism or war 
acts of terrorism  acts of war and other unforeseen events  may cause damage or disruption to our properties  business  employees  suppliers  distributors and clients  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
such events may also result in an economic slowdown in the united states or elsewhere  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
competitive environment 
we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services 
we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers  including electronic and print media companies  some of which may have greater financial  information gathering and marketing resources than we do 
these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future 
in addition  limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we compete 
as a result  additional new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services 
additionally  technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources 
although our market share has been increasing  increased competition may result in loss of market share  diminished value in our products and services  reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures 
we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis  timely delivery of information  customer service  the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis  or price 
renewal of research business by existing clients 
some of our success depends on renewals of our subscription based research products and services  which constituted  and of our business for the years ended september   and  respectively 
these research subscription agreements have terms that generally range from twelve to thirty months 
our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors  including those described in this annual report 
client retention rates were  and for the years ended september   and  respectively 
any material decline in renewal rates could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition 
non recurring consulting engagements 
consulting segment revenues constituted  and of our business for the years ended september   and  respectively 
such consulting engagements typically are project based and non recurring 
our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors  including those described in this annual report 
any material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition 
hiring and retention of employees 
our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management  research analysts  consultants  sales and other key personnel 
we face competition for the limited pool of these qualified professionals from  among others  technology companies  market research firms  consulting firms  financial services companies and electronic and print media companies  some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals 
some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to non compete agreements that could impede our short term recruitment efforts 
any failure to retain key personnel or hire and train additional qualified personnel  as required to support the evolving needs of clients or growth in our business  could adversely affect the quality of our products and services  and therefore  our future business and operating results 
maintenance of existing products and services 
we operate in a rapidly evolving market  and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients 
any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results 
further  if our predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research  our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline 
in addition  we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a cost effective manner 
failure to increase and improve our electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future business and operating results 
introduction of new products and services 
the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis 
to maintain our competitive position  we must continue to enhance and improve our products and services  develop or acquire new products and services in a timely manner  and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of producing them 
any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial position 
international operations 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales outside of north america  representing  and of our business for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
as a result  our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities  including general political and economic conditions in each country  changes in market demand as a result of exchange rate fluctuations and tariffs and other trade barriers  challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations  changes in regulatory requirements  compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations  different or overlapping tax structures  higher levels of united states taxation on foreign income  and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements  collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions 
we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations 
if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us  we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent 
branding 
we believe that our gartner brand is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases 
we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget  hire additional marketing and public relations personnel  expend additional sums to protect the brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty 
if we fail to effectively promote and maintain the gartner brand  or incur excessive expenses in doing so  our future business and operating results could be materially and adversely impacted 
investment activities 
we maintain investments in equity securities in private and publicly traded companies through direct ownership and through wholly and partially owned venture capital funds 
the companies we invest in are primarily early to mid stage it based and internet enabled businesses 
there are numerous risks related to such investments  due to their nature and the volatile public markets  including significant delay or failure of anticipated returns 
in addition  these entities may require additional financing to meet their cash and operational needs  however  there can be no assurance that such funds will be available to the extent needed at terms acceptable to the entities  if at all 
as a result  our financial results and financial position could be materially impacted 
indebtedness 
we have incurred significant indebtedness through our million convertible notes 
additionally  we have a million senior revolving credit facility under which we can incur significant additional indebtedness 
the affirmative  negative and financial covenants of these debt facilities  could limit our future financial flexibility 
the associated debt service costs could impair future operating results 
our outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us  which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services  respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital 
on the maturity date  april   we must satisfy any remaining notes for cash equal to the face amount of the notes plus accrued interest  if none of the notes have been redeemed or converted by that date  such amount will be million 
the payment of this amount could materially adversely impact our future business and operating results 
convertible notes 
commencing on april   or sooner in certain circumstances upon a change in control of the company  the holders of our million convertible notes may elect to convert all or a portion of the notes to shares of our class a common stock 
if all or a substantial portion of the notes are converted  the note holders will own a substantial number of shares of our class a common stock 
at september   the notes were convertible into million shares of our class a common stock  which would constitute of our combined class a and class b common stock  outstanding on that date 
this is based upon the conversion price of per share 
if the holders elect to convert the notes  we may redeem them 
see obligations and commitments and indebtedness above 
if we do not redeem the notes and all or a substantial portion of the notes are converted  the holder of the notes slp will become our largest shareholder based upon our shareholder base as of september  
this  in turn  may give slp the ability to exercise significant control over the company  create significant dilution for other shareholders  and may cause volatility in our stock price 
if we want to redeem the convertible notes in response to the note holders election to convert  or on our own under certain circumstances  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient capital on a commercially reasonable basis  or at all  in order to fund a redemption 
even if we could obtain sufficient capital to fund a redemption  it could materially adversely impact our future business and operating results 
organizational and product integration related to acquisitions 
we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses that offer complementary products and services 
the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition  dilution of the interests of our current stockholders or decreased working capital  increased indebtedness  the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks  the ability to integrate successfully the operations and personnel of the acquired business  the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company  the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired company  the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our business 
the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business 
enforcement of our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark  trade secret  confidentiality  non compete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights  unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary 
our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us 
the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
accordingly  we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized third party copying or use  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
our employees are subject to non compete agreements 
when the non competition period expires  former employees may compete against us 
if a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the non competition period  there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to enforce the non compete provision 
possibility of infringement claims 
third parties may assert infringement claims against us 
regardless of the merits  responding to any such claim could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms 
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected 
agreements with ims health incorporated 
in connection with our recapitalization in july  we agreed to certain restrictions on business activity to reduce the risk to ims health and its stockholders of substantial tax liabilities associated with the spin off by ims health of its equity interest in us 
we also agreed to assume the risk of such tax liabilities if we were to undertake certain business activities that give rise to the liabilities 
as a result  we may be limited in our ability to undertake acquisitions involving the issuance of a significant amount of stock unless we were to seek and obtain a ruling from the irs that the transaction will not give rise to such tax liabilities 
in addition  we agreed to certain limits on the purchase of our common stock under the terms of the recapitalization 
potential fluctuations in operating results 
our quarterly and annual operating income may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors  including the timing of the execution of research contracts  which typically occurs in the fourth calendar quarter  the extent of completion of consulting engagements  the timing of symposia and other events  which also occur to a greater extent in the fourth calendar quarter  the amount of new business generated  the mix of domestic and international business  changes in market demand for our products and services  the timing of the development  introduction and marketing of new products and services  and competition in the industry 
an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow  and achieve our forecasts  may impact our operating and other activities 
the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period to period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results 
euro conversion effective january   twelve of the fifteen member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their single currency 
the participating countries issued new euro denominated bills and coins for use in cash transactions 
effective july   legacy currency is no longer legal tender for any transactions in the participating countries 
we do not believe that the translation of financial transactions into euros has had  or will have  a significant effect on our results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
we do not anticipate any material impact from the euro conversion on our financial information systems  which accommodate multiple currencies 
costs associated with the adoption of the euro have not been and are not expected to be significant and are being expensed as incurred 
recently issued accounting standards in november  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
the consensus requires reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred to be characterized as revenue in the statements of operations 
out of pocket expenses are incidental expenses incurred as part of ongoing operations and include  but are not limited to  expenses related to airfare  mileage  hotel stays  out of town meals  photocopies and telecommunication and facsimile charges 
this consensus must be applied to financial reporting periods beginning after december  with reclassification of prior periods for comparability 
we adopted the consensus beginning with the second quarter of our fiscal year that began on january   and in accordance with the consensus  have restated prior periods 
for the years ended september   and  adoption of the consensus caused both revenues and cost of services and product development in the consulting segment to increase by million  million and million  respectively 
in april  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas no 
was issued 
fasb statement no 
required all gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt to be reported as extraordinary items and statement no 
related to the same matter 
sfas no 
requires gains and losses from certain debt extinguishment to not be reported as extraordinary items when the use of debt extinguishment is part of the risk management strategy 
statement no 
was issued to establish transitional requirements for motor carriers relative to intangible assets 
those transitions are completed  therefore statement is no longer necessary 
sfas no 
also amends statement no 
requiring sale leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after may   which will be our fiscal year 
the provisions relating to sale leaseback are effective for transactions after may  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
upon adoption  in  the extraordinary loss from the extinguishment of debt  net of taxes of million  or per share in fiscal will be reclassified to continuing operations 
in july  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas was issued 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between sfas and eitf relates to the timing of liability recognition 
under sfas  a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations as approval and finalization of our recent workforce and facility reductions announced on october  were initiated prior to the sfas effective date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of september   we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily from borrowings under long term debt which consists of a million unsecured senior revolving credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank and million of convertible subordinated notes see note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at september   there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
under the revolving credit facility  the interest rate on borrowings is libor plus an additional to basis points based on our debt to ebitda ratio 
we believe that an increase or decrease of in the effective interest rate on available borrowings from our senior revolving credit facility  if fully utilized  would not have a material effect on our future results of operations 
if markets were to decline  we could be required to accrue interest on the convertible debt that would exceed those based on current market rates 
each basis point decrease in interest would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately million based on the september  balance 
each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have an approximate million annual effect under the revolving credit facility if fully utilized 
forward purchase agreements beginning in  we entered into a series of forward purchase agreements that extended through may to offset the dilutive effect of stock based employee compensation plans 
these agreements were settled quarterly on a net basis in either shares of class a common stock or cash  at the company s option 
during the year ended september   two settlements resulted in our issuance of  shares of class a common stock and our payment of approximately  in cash 
during the quarter ended june   we reacquired  shares of class a common stock for approximately million through an early termination of the remaining forward purchase agreements 
as of september   there were no remaining commitments under these forward purchase agreements 
investment risk we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our equity investments 
we invest in equity securities of public and private companies directly and through si i  a wholly owned affiliate  and si ii  of which we own 
si i and si ii are engaged in making venture capital investments in early to mid stage it based or internet enabled companies see note investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as of september   we had investments in equity securities totaling million 
unrealized losses of  have been recorded net of deferred taxes of  as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
these investments are inherently risky as the businesses are typically in early development stages and may never develop 
further  certain of these investments are in publicly traded companies whose shares are subject to significant market price volatility 
adverse changes in market conditions and poor operating results of the underlying investments may result in us incurring additional losses or an inability to recover the original carrying value of our investments 
if there were a adverse change in the value of our equity portfolio as of september   this would result in a non cash impairment charge of million 
we intend to sell all of our investments owned through si i and si ii 
foreign currency exchange risk we face two risks related to foreign currency exchange translation risk and transaction risk 
amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the stockholders equity deficit section of the consolidated balance sheets 
our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the united states dollar 
since the functional currency of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency of our subsidiaries  the foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected as a component of stockholders equity and do not impact operating results 
revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies 
therefore  changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations 
currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in results of operations 
from time to time we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
during fiscal  we had a contract requiring us to sell us dollars and purchase japanese yen 
the contract was for million  a one year term that expired on september   and contained a forward exchange rate of japanese yen 
the foreign currency forward contract was entered into to offset the foreign exchange effects of our japanese yen inter company payable  which had a value of million 
on september   we settled this contract by paying  at september   we had two foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 
foreign exchange forward contracts are reflected at fair value with gains and losses recorded currently in earnings 
the following table presents information about our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of september   expressed in us dollar equivalents
