recent developments proposed acquisition of centra software inc on january   we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire centra software in a stock for stock transaction 
centra offers a comprehensive suite of real time knowledge delivery and management solutions  including voice enabled virtual classrooms  web conferences and online meetings 
centra offers advanced voice over ip technologies  with scalability across the extended enterprise and access through thin client architecture 
using the broad suite of centra applications  global organizations increase the overall effectiveness of their e learning and communication initiatives  targeting the appropriate mix of live and self paced learning formats and activities for each audience or strategic business task 
centra s solutions enable real time  group oriented human interaction over corporate networks and the internet 
under the terms of the agreement  centra shareholders will receive ordinary shares of smartforce represented by adss for each share of centra s common stock 
the transaction is valued at approximately million  including the assumption of centra s stock options 
the proposed acquisition further solidifies our position as the world s largest e learning company 
centra brings to us world class technology  talented employees and a blue chip customer base that will complement the more than  customers we already enjoy 
through the acquisition  we will add centra s base of over customers  the majority of which are new to us 
moreover  the deal will solidify our position as a market leader with over  employees  including over customer facing employees  and combined research and development investment of over million  more than triple the investment of any other publicly traded corporate e learning company

the acquisition has been approved by both companies boards of directors and is subject to various closing conditions  including approval by the shareholders of both companies and obtaining specific regulatory approvals 
if such closing conditions have not been fulfilled or waived  the merger will not be consummated 
since announcing the proposed acquisition  smartforce s adss have declined in value  which increases the risk that shareholder approval may not be obtained 
the failure to consummate the merger would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the successful combination of smartforce and centra  including the successful operation of centra as an autonomous subsidiary of smartforce  will require substantial effort from each company 
the diversion of the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the transition process could have an adverse impact on our ability to realize the full benefits of the acquisition 
the successful combination of the two companies will also require coordination of our research and development and sales and marketing efforts 
in addition  the process of combining the two organizations could cause the interruption of  or loss of momentum in  centra s activities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain centra s technical  sales and marketing personnel  or that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition

industry background organizations in nearly all sectors face an increasingly challenging environment  characterized by issues such as rapid technological advancements  changes in business models  increased globalization  escalating competitive forces  information overflow  shorter lead times and product life cycles  and decreasing budgets 
to overcome these challenges  organizations must develop strategies to continually innovate and transform themselves 
just in time  effective distribution of information is required in order to increase the knowledge and skills possessed by an organization s entire workforce and its extended enterprise 
this effective distribution of information enables organizations to achieve goals such as reduced time to market of new products and services  improve the productivity of sales channels and reduce customer service support costs  which can also enhance the organization s competitive advantage 
traditionally  organizations have attempted to address their learning needs through investments in instructor led training from external vendors or internal training departments 
instructor led training  however  can be costly  time consuming and a logistical challenge  typically requiring employees to leave their workplaces for prolonged periods  often to attend classes at off site locations 
such training is also difficult to customize to the organizational needs of a specific company or to tailor to the training needs of a particular individual 
moreover  traditional instructor led training cannot be easily reviewed and assessed by management and is difficult to update on a regular basis 
furthermore  as many companies continue to expand their operations globally  they often find it difficult to deploy and deliver consistent and timely instructor led training throughout the organization and its extended enterprise 
in response to the historical shortcomings of instructor led training programs  companies are spending increased amounts on technology based training 
first generation technology based training products such as interactive courseware delivered through corporate networks or the internet address many of the shortcomings of instructor led training 
however  the rapid growth and development of the internet creates opportunities for providers to build upon the benefits of these methods to design and deliver new and more powerful customizable learning offerings 
the internet allows for the creation of an application infrastructure that enables businesses to customize and personalize the learning process  effectively assess skill levels and manage learning outcomes and connect learners in real time with online experts 
additionally  the internet provides a more effective medium for deploying and delivering content to widely dispersed operations and the extended enterprise and improves the means of product and user support 
moreover  the internet allows companies to outsource their learning infrastructure allowing them to focus on their core competencies 
a number of providers are using the internet as a delivery mechanism for courseware 
however  these products fail to leverage the power of the internet to transform the training process 
as a result  there is a significant opportunity for integrated e learning solutions that combine a comprehensive body of instructional content and an advanced learning management system with an array of content authoring and publication tools to provide an enabling infrastructure for learning throughout the extended enterprise 
the smartforce e learning solution we provide organizations with fully hosted solutions that increase competitive advantage by training their employees and partners more quickly  efficiently and effectively 
we believe the most critical elements of a comprehensive and effective solution are content  technology and services 
key elements of the smartforce solution are integrated e learning platform 
the smartforce e learning platform is the underlying infrastructure for our e learning solutions 
our platform is based on e  an integrated  object based application architecture that enables us to offer our customers solutions precisely targeted to their strategic business initiatives and requirements 
incorporating emerging internet technologies  our platform includes a learning management system  content distribution capabilities  e collaboration  assessment engines  content publishing and competency management 
a key feature of the platform is that it is built on an architecture that enables us to deliver our extensive body of e learning content in the form of learning objects  which can be combined into learning paths that are customized for each organization and personalized for the individual learner 
e is also an open architecture incorporating industry standards  enabling customers to integrate internally created and third party content 
comprehensive content 
our learning environment offers a broad range of learning objects on a variety of topics  including technical  business  customer relationship management  contact center  sales and healthcare and other vertical markets 
we develop our learning objects in collaboration with leading software providers and training organizations  including microsoft  cisco  informix  intel  lotus  netscape  novell  oracle  rational software  sap  ariba and provant 
our offerings include over  hours of learning content  online smartseminars  x smartmentoring  smartsimulations  e testing  articles  online workshops and other peer to peer collaborative events 
our platform allows our learning objects to be assembled into personalized learning paths to meet specific educational objectives 
e learning tools and services 
we provide a variety of e learning tools that allow our customers to customize the learning environment to meet their specific needs  to assess the educational progress of learners and to generate reports to monitor training effectiveness 
our content authoring and publication tools enable customers to create their own learning objects and integrate them into our learning environment 
our e testing and fast track assessment tools help learners avoid unnecessary and duplicative training and give them the ability to effectively assess skill levels and manage learning outcomes to meet their specific educational objectives 
our reporting tools allow managers to generate a broad range of reports to track the effectiveness of training programs 
we can also assist customers in developing their own proprietary content 
strategy our objective is to be the leading provider of comprehensive  integrated learning solutions to organizations and their extended enterprises 
key elements of our strategy include expand penetration among leading global businesses and existing customer base 
we intend on using our experienced direct sales force and our extensive channel distribution capabilities to increase our penetration into the world s largest organizations 
in order to successfully achieve this goal  we intend to articulate the clear value and return on investment propositions that our solutions provide to new and existing customers 
templetize and productize our e learning offerings 
we intend on developing pre configured combinations of our content  services elements and platform functionalities specifically designed to automate the learning needs in areas such as sales  contact center  human resources and it training environments 
these packages  called smartforce solutionsets  focus on critical business processes that exist in nearly every organization 
the budgets and potential buyers for the solutions are easily identified and the value propositions are clear by automating the process versus doing them manually  the customer will significantly reduce time to competency and also reduce costs 
the solutions will be productized so they are more easily replicated for different customers 
continue to expand our e learning solutions 
through internal development  partnerships and acquisitions  we expect to continually expand the number and types of e learning offerings in order to provide the most comprehensive  global and educationally rich solutions available 
for example  we plan to leverage our streamlined development process engine to aggressively expand our comprehensive body of learning content into different related areas  in addition to deepening our existing content offerings 
we also expect to continue investing in localization of content to further enhance our existing global e learning offerings 
furthermore  we intend to continue expanding our e learning platform in order to provide additional functionalities and feature rich solutions that can be tailored to meet our customers specific requirements 
develop and expand alliances with content partners 
we intend to continue to enter into development and marketing alliances with key business  e business  vertical market and technology vendors to produce and market vendor specific authorized training programs 
we believe these alliances provide a number of competitive advantages  including access to partners product development plans  source material and distribution channels as well as significantly accelerating our introduction of new content offerings 
we intend to expand our existing relationships and to enter into relationships with new content partners  including leaders in emerging internet technologies  vertical markets and providers of business skills material 
develop additional partnerships 
we plan to expand and strengthen our partnerships with companies to provide smartforce e learning as the platform for their e learning initiatives 
for example  we recently entered into an agreement with exult  a leading human resource business process outsourcer for the global smartforce s e learning will be integrated into exult s human resource offering allowing smartforce solutions to be made available across their enterprises because training is a critical component of human resource functions  as well as other business processes 
we also recently entered a strategic alliance with pwc consulting  a business of pricewaterhousecoopers  to position smartforce e learning as a core platform for pwc s e learning consultancy practice 
we believe that these relationships provide us with significant opportunity to target new markets and expand the reach of our e learning solutions 
expand channels of distribution and international presence 
we have primarily targeted fortune companies and other major us and international organizations through our direct sales force 
we intend to expand our indirect sales channels and telesales efforts to target companies beyond the fortune and to accelerate our market penetration worldwide 
for example in we entered into distribution agreements with distribution partners in central america and india which we believe will expand the presence of smartforce e learning in the global marketplace 
products and services smartforce e learning solutions smartforce e learning solutions include a standards based  integrated e learning platform  a learning management system  a large body of learning objects  a suite of publication  custom content  assessment and management tools and a range of related services

we offer discounted prices for longer term commitments and larger numbers of authorized users to drive larger and longer term contracts 
smartforce e learning platform 
our e learning platform features a content management system for the delivery of instructional content and a learning management system that allows customers to manage all aspects of their training programs 
our e learning platform is based on an integrated object based application architecture through which learning content is broken down into individual objects  each covering a single  discrete learning objective 
a learning object can be based on any learning medium for example a lesson  a seminar  a role play simulation or a lab 
we use our learning object framework to provide flexible  comprehensive and integrated learning solutions tailored precisely to enterprise and learner needs 
our content management system employs mass customization technology  which allows us to customize the environment for each corporate customer and to personalize the learning experience for each learner based on the learner s interests  career objectives and job profile 
corporate customers can customize the environment by selecting from our wide selection of learning options and by integrating their own content into our environment 
through the use of macromedia s dreamweaver and other content authoring and publication tools  our customers can create their own learning events which incorporate their own courseware and other proprietary material 
this allows customers to create learning paths that address their specific needs and which provide each individual learner with a personalized view into the environment

as of december   we had learning content in languages other than english  namely german  french  spanish  portuguese  japanese  italian  greek  dutch  finnish and korean 
we also offer the services of online mentors as a resource for learners to help them more effectively grasp the materials covered by lessons and to pass vendor certification exams 
smartmentoring focuses on integrating internet technologies with proven learning methodologies to deliver internet based  certification level mentoring services to students worldwide 
smartmentoring provides access to a team of vendor certified mentors  known as learning advisors  who are available twenty four hours a day  seven days a week

fasttrack test prep simulates a certification exam environment  where the learner is given challenging  scenario based questions to answer within a time frame 
upon completion of the fasttrack test prep the learner can check their score  access detailed explanations and see how questions relate to exam objectives 
finally  in  we acquired a company called skillscape  which is a leading provider of competency management systems

we also offer maintenance with respect to our software offerings 
other products historically  our customers have deployed our content using a variety of technologies  primarily using standalone pcs and local and wide area networks and corporate intranets 
our legacy software offerings are platform and content offerings that are intended to be accessed over standalone pcs or wholly on customers private internal networks 
legacy content offerings consist of cd rom based courseware for it professionals that is accessed locally without leveraging the internet 
we have also developed a number of products that address deployment of content using local delivery methods  including smartforceweb  smartforceweb plus and smartforce campus 
smartforceweb is an intranet deployment system which allows users to download smartforce courseware titles across an intranet 
access to these titles is gained through a standard browser 
smartforceweb enables customers to access and manage smartforce courses over an intranet via internally managed web servers 
using smartforceweb  learners can choose to either download smartforce courseware or interact with it in real time over an intranet using smartforces liveplay capability 
in we released smartforce campus  an enterprise training management and deployment architecture 
coupled with our library of titles  smartforce campus provides our customers with a solution for delivering interactive technology training wherever and however it is needed  running over an intranet 
smartforce campus features a university campus metaphor as an easy to navigate student interface  which can be accessed either as a windows client application or a web browser plug in 
behind this intuitive interface is a suite of sophisticated technologies that creates an integrated learning environment for students and administrators 
strategic alliances we have entered into  and will continue to expand  our relationships with leading content partners  vendors of software products and learning partners in the markets of e business  business  interpersonal and professional skills  vertical education and training and it 
we have entered into alliances with ariba  broadvision  cisco  informix  intel  lotus  macromedia  microsoft  netscape  rational software  novell  oracle  provant  sap and the jcert consortium which is a collaboration between bea software  hewlett packard  ibm  oracle  sun microsystems  sybase and iplanet e commerce solution  yahoo  qwest and akamai 
we formed the internet security training consortium to develop and market training content which addresses the internet security training needs of enterprises worldwide with leading technology companies including check point  cisco  ibm  intel  the javasoft business unit of sun microsystems  lotus  netscape  network associates  rsa security  security dynamics  hewlett packard and verisign 
we believe our development alliances offer a number of competitive advantages  which may include early access to business content and partners pre released products as well as software engineers and technical advisors for assistance in developing our learning solutions 
with the approval of the development partner  products developed under the relationship can be identified as authorized by that content partner  which we believe improves the marketability of such courses 
in addition  these alliances may result in additional distribution channels for us by allowing each party to distribute courses to its respective customer base 
in some of these alliances  the software vendor has contributed financial resources toward the development of specified courses 
we believe that these alliances also provide significant benefits to the content partner by allowing them to achieve additional market penetration generated by increasing the base of trained users 
we also have partnered with major system integration and consulting companies  including deloitte consulting  kpmg and pricewaterhousecoopers 
we believe these relationships may be important contributors to our distribution channel because these partners are investing resources in developing e learning practices 
we also entered into agreements to resell third party content 
during we entered into third party vendor agreements with intellexis  strategic management group  wecomply and gotrain 
these relationships enable us to offer business  it and other content and technologies to our customers  which we may not otherwise have access to and allows us to offer to our customers comprehensive and advanced learning solutions 
customers we primarily license our learning solutions to fortune companies and other major us and international organizations in a wide range of industries  including manufacturing  technology  transportation  telecommunications  utilities  healthcare and financial services 
we also license our learning solutions to educational institutions and governmental agencies 
our solutions are marketed through the industry s largest direct sales organization to over  corporate customers worldwide 
in addition  through our resellers and our telesales force  we market our learning solutions directly to individuals 
no customer accounted for more than of revenues in  although a single customer can account for a significantly higher percentage of our revenues in any particular quarter 
accordingly  failure to achieve a forecasted sale on schedule can have and did have in the third quarter of a material adverse effect on quarterly operating results 
research and development we believe that the development of an effective training product requires the convergence of source material  instructional design and computer technology 
in developing a new learning event  we first obtain content from our content partners and other subject matter experts  existing courses and product reference materials 
our development team then writes a script for the learning event which includes a structure covering all of the relevant concepts  tasks to be completed and interactive features of the learning event as well as tests that allow the user to measure his or her achievement and reinforce the lesson 
when we develop a script for a new learning event  our developers  working with animators  simulation programmers and graphic designers  simultaneously plan and develop the various elements  which are then integrated into a learning event 
after the integration process  we test the learning event to ensure that it has the capability to deliver the desired level of education and training 
the core element of our learning solution development process is our streamlined development process engine 
this engine is an environment comprised of our own proprietary software together with off the shelf tools  which we have optimized to allow us to create our interactive education learning events 
we believe that our product development engine provides us with a significant competitive advantage by allowing us to quickly and efficiently create and continually update modular learning events and enhance  on an ongoing basis  the multimedia content of such learning events 
our research and development goal is to further enhance our product development engine so as to facilitate the continual evolution of our offerings and ensure that our educational programs are able to incorporate a wide variety of multimedia elements 
we perform most of our research and development activities at our product development center in dublin  ireland and through third party services 
our research and development expenses totaled million in  million in and million in as of december   the number of employees in research and development totaled we intend to continue to make substantial investments in research and development 
intellectual property and licenses we regard our technology as proprietary and we rely primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  customer licensing agreements  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary rights 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our learning content and technology without our authorization  or to independently develop learning content and technology 
furthermore  the laws of certain countries in which we sell our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
although we generally do not include in our learning offerings any mechanisms to prevent or inhibit unauthorized use  we do require our customers to execute a license agreement which contains restrictions on the copying and use of our products 
however  our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
alternatively  our competitors could independently develop technology similar to ours without infringing our proprietary rights 
if our products or other elements of our intellectual property were copied or otherwise misappropriated  our business and operations could be significantly adversely affected 
there has been a substantial amount of litigation in software and internet industries regarding intellectual property rights 
third parties could in the future claim that our current or future products infringe on the proprietary rights of others 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  resulting in costly litigation or product shipment delays or could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
if such royalty or licensing agreements were required  they may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all  which could seriously harm our business 
competition the market for corporate training solutions is highly competitive  constantly evolving and subject to rapidly emerging technologies 
the market is highly fragmented with no single competitor accounting for a dominant market share 
we compete primarily with learning companies  computer based training companies  instructor led training vendors and education platform providers 
in addition to increased competition from new companies entering into the market  established companies are entering into the e learning market directly and through acquisitions of smaller companies which directly compete with us 
we expect the e learning market to become increasingly competitive due to the lack of significant barriers to entry 
we may also face competition from publishing companies and vendors of application software  including those vendors with whom we have formed development and marketing alliances 
our primary source of direct competition comes from third party suppliers of instructor led it  business  management and professional skills education and training as well as other suppliers of computer or internet based training and learning solutions 
we also face indirect competition from the internal training departments of our potential customers and have to overcome potential customers reluctance to move away from existing training systems and processes 
we also compete to a lesser extent with consultants  value added resellers and network integrators all of which market products which compete with ours 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our market place are the depth  breadth and variety of content  the ability to offer complete learning solutions  an installed customer base  the size and experience of the sales force offering the solutions  product quality  product functionality  return on investment and cost effectiveness of the solutions 
although we believe that our learning solutions currently compete favorably with respect to these factors  our market is relatively new and is evolving rapidly 
we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors  especially those with significantly greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources 
many of our current and potential competitors also have greater name recognition than we do 
we believe our success will depend on our ability to expand our learning offerings  adopt new technologies and continue to offer the most extensive and educationally rich learning solutions available in our industry 
however  we may be unable to provide products that compare favorably with new instructor led techniques or the learning offerings of our competitors 
competitive pressures may also force us to reduce the prices of our products significantly 
sales and marketing in  our products were marketed in over countries 
we market and sell our products and services through a direct sales force which  as of december   consisted of people worldwide  of whom were located in the united states 
our sales offices are located in the united states  the united kingdom  australia  the middle east  the benelux and scandinavian countries  canada  new zealand  france  germany  ireland  singapore and south africa 
we also engage in selling efforts through our telesales organization  which  as of december   employed people  all of whom are located in the united states 
in order to accelerate our worldwide market penetration  we are broadening our sales strategy through our indirect sales channels such as reseller and distributor partners 
our indirect sales channels give us access to a more diverse client base  which we otherwise would not be able to reach in a cost effective manner through our direct sales force 
at december   we employed indirect sales channel employees 
our development and marketing partners also generally have the right to resell products developed under their alliances with us

prior to  we derived our revenues primarily pursuant to software license agreements under which customers license usage of delivered software products for a period of one  two or three years 
on each anniversary date during the term of multi year license agreements  customers were generally allowed to exchange any or all of the licensed products for an equivalent number of alternative products within our library 
the first year license fee was generally recognized as revenue at the time of delivery of all products  provided a signed contract or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed  our fees were fixed or determinable and collections of accounts receivable were probable 
subsequent annual license fees under the software license model were recognized on each anniversary date 
revenues from license agreements providing product exchange rights other than annually during the term of the agreement were deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period 
we currently recognize the majority of our revenues pursuant to software license agreements 
we recognize revenue from software license agreements in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop sop  as amended 
revenue is recognized from software license agreements when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
our current license agreements generally include multiple elements  which may include such elements as access on an asp basis to hosted content or platform services for a specified number of years  up front software licenses  software rentals for a specified number of years  professional services  maintenance and resale of third parties products and services 
where possible  we allocate revenue to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe in accordance with the provisions of sop  as amended  and recognizes the revenue associated with each element in accordance with the relevant revenue recognition requirements for that element 
where vsoe does not exist  we aggregate the elements and recognizes the revenues with respect to all elements on delivery of the last delivered elements  as provided in sop  as amended 
revenue associated with customer access to hosted content or platform services is generally deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
revenue associated with up front software licenses is generally recognized immediately on delivery 
revenue associated with software rentals with annual exchange rights is generally recognized immediately on delivery for the first annual rental period and on each contract anniversary date thereafter for subsequent annual rental periods 
revenue associated with software rentals providing product exchange rights other than annually during the term of the agreement is generally deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
revenue associated with professional services agreements is recognized as earned as development progresses based on the percentage of completion method 
revenue associated with the resale of third parties products and services is generally recognized as above  depending on the character of the product or service resold 
revenue from sales of our products is recognized upon shipment  net of allowances for estimated future returns and for excess quantities in distribution channels 
revenues from product development arrangements are generally recognized on a percentage of completion basis as milestones are completed or as products are produced under the arrangement 
the cost of satisfying any post contract support pcs is accrued at the time revenue is recognized as pcs fees are included in the annual license fee  the estimated cost of providing pcs during the agreements is insignificant and unspecified upgrades or enhancements offered have been and are expected to be minimal and infrequent 
we also continue to derive revenues from our legacy business selling cd rom based courseware for it professionals to be deployed on standalone pcs or on private  local company networks 
customers may acquire these legacy offerings on a multi year rental basis  in which case revenues are recognized on the same basis as described above with respect to revenue recognition generally prior to customers may also acquire our legacy offerings by up front license as is typically the case when individual it professionals acquire certification programs through our smartcertify direct subsidiary  in which case revenues are recognized immediately on delivery 
the migration of our business beginning in to an e learning solutions model resulted in the deferral of a significant portion of our revenues from year into  and  accordingly  a decrease in reported revenues in year compared to year as well as a decrease in reported revenues for each quarter during year as compared to that which would be expected under the historical model 
as a result  year over year comparisons between our operating results for each reporting period in and each reporting period in  including comparisons of revenue and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues  will not necessarily be meaningful measures of our financial performance during as part of our migration to an e learning solutions model  we have made significant investments in our e learning infrastructure and in our sales and marketing efforts 
in particular  we have significantly increased i our research and development expenses and capital expenditures to build out our e learning infrastructure and ii our sales and marketing expenses to build smartforce s market presence 
as a result of the deferral of revenue under the new model and these incremental expenses  we recorded a net loss in we recorded net income in as a result of the deferral of revenue from into and revenue generated under new license agreements in which were partially offset by increased expenditure in research and development and selling and marketing expenses in in recent years  we have entered into several content development and marketing alliances with key vendors of technology software under which we develop learning content for training on specific products 
under certain of our development and marketing alliances  our partners have agreed to fund certain product development costs 
we recognize such funding as revenues on a percentage of completion basis  and the costs associated with such revenues are reflected as cost of revenues 
these agreements have the effect of shifting expenses associated with developing certain new products from research and development to cost of revenues 
we expect that cost of revenues may fluctuate from period to period in the future based upon many factors 
we do not expect funding from development partners to contribute significantly to revenues in future years 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of revenues for the three years ended december  years ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of acquired intangibles acquired research and development total operating expenses income loss from operations other income  net income loss before provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss revenues revenues increased from million in to million in revenues were million 
the increase in revenue in compared to is attributable to increased sales of our core offerings and to the deferral of revenue from into following the introduction of smartforce e learning in the increase in revenue is also attributable to investments in our e learning solutions and offerings such as increased business  interpersonal skills  it  and sales training  sales of our learning management system and professional services 
revenues decreased in from as a result of the rapid customer adoption in the twelve months ended december  of our learning solutions  for which revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the customer agreement and deferred into future periods 
revenues in and earlier years were generated from licenses of software under our historical model  under which revenue is recognized annually in advance on the anniversary date of a contract 
because of the introduction of smartforce e learning we do not believe that the year over year revenue comparison between the years and is indicative of the growth of our business during the year ended december  revenues in the united states increased from million or of revenues in to million or of revenues in revenues in the united states were million or of revenues in the decrease in revenue in the united states in compared to was primarily attributable to the rapid customer adoption of smartforce e learning by customers in the united states corporate market resulting in the deferral of revenue from into revenues in the united kingdom increased from million or of revenues in to million or of revenues in revenues in ireland increased from million or of revenues in to million or of revenues in revenues in the united kingdom were million or of revenues in and revenues in ireland were million or of revenues in revenue in the united kingdom has not changed significantly in dollar terms during the years to revenue in ireland grew as a result of increased sales of our e learning platform and development revenue generated in ireland 
revenues from countries outside the united states  the united kingdom and ireland principally from the far east  latin america  australia  europe other than ireland and the united kingdom  canada  south africa and the middle east increased from million or of revenues in to million or of revenues in revenues from outside the united states  the united kingdom and ireland were million or of revenues in the increase in international percentage of revenue in compared to was due primarily to a more rapid adoption of e learning in the united states corporate market compared to the international corporate market  resulting in the deferral of a greater proportion of the united states revenue compared to international revenue 
following the migration to the e learning model in the usa in the reduction in the international percentage of revenue in compared to was primarily due to the increased revenue in the usa due to the deferral of revenue from into as well as increased revenue in the usa during because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states  we are subject to numerous risks of doing business in other countries  including risks related to currency fluctuations 
the terrorist attacks on the united states on september  caused serious disruption to our sales efforts  and as a result our bookings in the third and fourth quarters of fell short of internal targets and our original expectations 
because bookings in a given quarter can generally affect not only that quarter s revenue  but also revenues for future quarters  lower than anticipated bookings during the third and fourth quarters negatively impacted revenue in both the third and fourth quarters and are expected to continue to negatively affect revenues in no customer accounted for more than of revenues in  or  although a single customer can account for a significantly higher percentage of our revenues for any given quarter 
accordingly  failure to achieve a forecasted sale on schedule can have  and did have in the third quarter of  a material adverse effect on quarterly operating results 
although our license agreements are generally non cancelable by their terms  customers may not fulfill the contractual obligations under our agreements 
cancellation  reduction or delay in orders by or shipments to any customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
cost of revenues cost of revenues includes the cost of materials such as packaging and documentation  royalties to third parties  the portion of development costs associated with funded development projects  hosting  the cost of providing professional services  fulfillment and shipping and handling costs and the amortization of the cost of purchased products 
gross margins were essentially flat from to  representing in and in gross margins in were 
the decrease in gross margin in compared to resulted primarily from a change in our revenue mix between content and services 
this change in revenue mix continued in in and  we incurred additional costs associated with services provided to our customers in respect of platform and content customization 
revenue generated from services did not exceed of our net revenues in any year reported 
we expect that cost of revenues may fluctuate from period to period in the future based upon many factors  including the revenue mix including between software  hosted content  platform and content customization services and partner s products and the timing of expenses associated with development and marketing alliances 
in addition  as the non software license components of our revenues  particularly professional services  increase as a percentage of revenues  we expect gross margins to decline 
operating expenses operating expenses increased in absolute dollar terms from million or of revenues in to million or of revenues in operating expenses were million or of revenues in operating expenses increased during the periods presented as a result of the growth in our business and our ongoing investments in our e learning solutions and smartforce s sales and marketing efforts 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  related overhead costs  travel expenses and fees paid to outside consultants 
research and development expenses increased in absolute dollar terms from million or of revenues in to million or of revenues in research and development expenses were million or of revenues in the increases in research and development expenses in the periods reported are due primarily to the hiring of additional research and development personnel  the continued investment in our e learning solutions and the development and enhancement of our e application architecture  all of which are required to further develop and expand our e learning offerings and our e learning infrastructure 
we believe that significant investment in research and development is required to remain competitive in the corporate training market 
we are committed to maintaining this investment  and accordingly  research and development expenses are expected to increase in future periods 
software development costs are accounted for in accordance with the financial accounting standards board statement no 
 under which we are required to capitalize software development costs after technological feasibility has been established 
to date  development costs after establishment of technological feasibility have been immaterial  and all software development costs have been expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions  travel expenses  advertising and promotional expenses and related overhead costs

sales and marketing expenses increased from million or of revenues in to million or of revenues in sales and marketing expenses were million or of revenues in the increase in selling and marketing costs in compared to is primarily attributable to the higher absolute dollar costs of commissions as a result of increased revenue in compared to and increased sales and marketing headcount costs 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in compared to  in absolute dollars  was primarily attributable to increases in the number of sales and marketing personnel to accommodate the growth in sales and increases in advertising and promotional expenses to build the smartforce brand 
these increases were partially offset by the deferral of a portion of commission costs in as a result of the deferral of revenue following the migration to the e learning model  as discussed above 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  travel expenses  legal  accounting and consulting fees and related overhead costs for administrative officers and support personnel 
general and administrative expenses increased from million or of revenues in to million or of revenues in general and administrative expenses were million or of revenues in in and  general and administrative expenses increased over and to support our expanding operations 
amortization of acquired intangibles amortization of acquired intangibles increased from million or of revenues in to million or of revenues in amortization of acquired intangibles was million or of revenues in amortization of acquired intangibles increased in compared to as a result of a full year amortization charge for the aes and learning productions acquisitions as well as additional amortization of intangibles in following the acquisitions of icglobal  the assets of impaxselling 
com and skillscape during amortization of acquired intangibles increased in compared to primarily as a result of twelve months amortization of goodwill and acquired intangibles from the knowledge well acquisition and the additional amortization of intangibles following the acquisitions of aes and learning productions in in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which will require us to discontinue the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives acquired in business combinations we have completed in the past 
we adopted sfas as of january   and thus will only continue to amortize acquired intangibles with definite lives 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas on our financial statements and related disclosures 
however  following our adoption of sfas on january   we estimate that the quarterly amortization of acquired intangibles  based on our acquired intangibles at december   and barring any additional acquisitions will be approximately million 
we expect the amortization of identifiable intangible assets to increase if we continue to acquire companies and technologies 
in particular  we expect a significant increase in amortization of acquired intangibles in connection with the centra acquisition

our actual future performance may differ materially from our current expectations 
you are strongly encouraged to review the section entitled additional risk factors that could affect operating results commencing on page and discussions elsewhere in this annual report on form k of the factors that could affect future performance 
under sfas no 
 we will be required periodically to evaluate for impairment the amount of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives resulting from past  pending and future acquisitions 
if we were to conclude that the value of any of these assets had been impaired  we would be required to write down the affected asset s to the extent of the impairment 
this could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results for the periods affected 
acquired research and development the acquired in process research and development of million expensed in represented our estimate of the fair value of those specifically identified knowledge well research and development projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and for which alternative future uses did not exist 
we expect to record an additional charge in for acquired in process research and development in connection with the centra acquisition 
other income  net other income  net  comprises interest income  interest expense  gain or loss on sale of assets and foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
other income  net  decreased from million in to million in other income  net  was million in the decrease in other income  net  in was primarily due to the decrease in interest income from million in to million in due primarily to the significant decrease in us interest rates in compared to during we incurred net exchange losses of million as compared to million in the net exchange loss in was primarily due to the implementation of sfas no 
and the resulting ineffectiveness of certain cashflow hedges into which we had entered 
the increase in other income  net  in compared to was primarily as a result of interest income in of million as compared to million in due to increased interest rates in as compared to net exchange losses of million were incurred in as compared to million in the exchange losses incurred were due to the weakening of the euro and related currencies to the us dollar 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in dollars  although several of our subsidiaries have functional currencies other than the dollar  and a significant portion of our revenues  costs and assets and those of our subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than their respective functional currencies 
we have significant subsidiaries in the united kingdom  australia  the netherlands and canada whose functional currencies are their local currencies and the majority of whose sales and operating expenses  other than cost of goods sold are denominated in their respective local currencies 
in addition  our irish subsidiaries  whose functional currency is the us dollar  incur substantial operating expenses denominated in euro  or  previously  irish pounds 
fluctuations in exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  particularly our operating margins  and could result in exchange losses 
the relevant effectiveness of our cashflow hedges can also impact exchange gains or losses 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations cannot be accurately predicted 
our subsidiaries in the united kingdom  canada  the netherlands and australia  whose functional currencies are their local currencies  had unhedged liabilities denominated in us dollars payable to smartforce this paragraph consists of forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations

ireland at december  of million  million  million and million  respectively 
during the twelve months ended december  and  we undertook hedging transactions against the irish pound because we have substantial expenses denominated in that currency 
to date  we have not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rates of other currencies against the u 
s dollar  but may undertake such transactions in the future 
any hedging techniques implemented by us may not be successful in eliminating or reducing the effects of currency fluctuations 
other income  net  may fluctuate in future periods as a result of movements in cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances  interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  asset and investment disposals and write downs 
provision for income taxes we operate as a holding company with operating subsidiaries in several countries  and each subsidiary is taxed based on the laws of the jurisdiction in which it operates 
because taxes are incurred at the subsidiary level  and one subsidiary s tax losses cannot be used to offset the taxable income of subsidiaries in other tax jurisdictions  our consolidated effective tax rate may increase to the extent that we report tax losses in some subsidiaries and taxable income in others 
we have significant operations and generate a majority of our income in ireland  and certain of our irish operating subsidiaries are taxed at rates substantially lower than tax rates in effect in the united states and other countries in which we have operations 
two irish subsidiaries currently qualify for a tax rate on income derived from software substantially developed in ireland 
another irish subsidiary is income tax exempt in respect of income from patented inventions the research and development of which was carried out in ireland 
if such subsidiaries were no longer to qualify for such tax rates or if the tax laws were rescinded or changed  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
moreover  because we incur income tax in several countries  an increase in our profitability in one or more of these countries could result in a higher overall tax rate 
in addition  if tax authorities were to challenge successfully the manner in which profits are recognized among our subsidiaries  our taxes could increase and our cash flow and net income could be materially adversely affected

the increase in cash flow from financing activities in and is primarily attributable to employee stock option exercises 
we believe that the granting of stock options is essential in attracting and retaining key employees who are critical to our success 
there can be no assurance that employee stock activity will continue to generate substantial funds in the future 
the exercise price of a significant number of the exercisable options exceed the current share price and  if this continues  cash inflow from option exercises and thus financing activities will be reduced in our existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balance may decline during fiscal  primarily as a result of lower cash flows from financing  although we believe our existing balances together with our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
if the global economy weakens further the decline in cash  cash equivalents and investment balances may be greater than presently anticipated 
we expect to continue our investing activities  including expenditure on computer systems  research and development  sales and marketing and administrative staff 
furthermore  we may from time to time consider the acquisition of complementary businesses  products or technologies  which may require additional financing or pursue other strategic capital raising 
recent accounting pronouncements the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  in june sfas  which requires all derivative instruments to be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at their fair value  provides a comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities 
as amended  this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we applied the new rules prospectively to transactions beginning in the first quarter of the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle due to the adoption of sfas resulted in the recognition of a net loss of  in the income statement and a net gain of million in other comprehensive income

the statement further requires that the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives be tested for impairment upon adoption of this statement  annually and upon the occurrence of certain events 
sfas is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  and for all business combinations accounted for by the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is after june  the provisions of sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted sfas as of january  during the first half of  we will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas on our financial statements and related disclosures 
this paragraph consists of forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations 
our actual future performance may differ materially from our current expectations 
you are strongly encouraged to review the section entitled additional risk factors that could affect operating results commencing on page and discussions elsewhere in this annual report on form k of the factors that could affect future performance 
this paragraph consists of forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations 
our actual future performance may differ materially from our current expectations 
you are strongly encouraged to review the section entitled additional risk factors that could affect operating results commencing on page and discussions elsewhere in this annual report on form k of the factors that could affect future performance 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
the statement requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application encouraged 
based on current circumstances  we believe the application of the new rules will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
the statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations  for a disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier application encouraged 
we adopted sfas as of january  and we do not expect that the adoption of the statement will have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  intangible assets  investments  percentage of completion contracts  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the critical accounting policies described below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize the majority of our revenue pursuant to software license agreements 
revenue from software license agreements is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
whether the fee is fixed or determinable is assessed based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
collection is assessed based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
a signed license agreement or a written contract is used as evidence of an arrangement 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we derive revenue from professional services agreements a significant number of which are fixed price  fixed time contracts  which require the accurate estimation of the cost  scope and duration of each engagement 
revenue and the related costs for these projects are recognized on percentage of completion  using the time to completion method to measure the percent complete with revisions to estimates reflected in the period in which changes become known 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or we do not manage the projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy our obligations under the contracts  then future margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
impairment of intangible assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important  which could trigger an impairment review  include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  any impairment is measured based on a projected net discounted cash flows expected to result from that asset  including eventual disposition 
following our adoption of sfas on january   we will cease to amortize goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we expect to complete the initial review during the first half of additional risk factors that could affect operating results important note about forward looking statements in addition to historical statements  this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements relate to the financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  dividends  financing plan  business strategy  operating efficiencies or synergies  budget  capital and other expenditures  competitive position  growth opportunities for existing products  benefits from new technology  plans and objectives of management  market for smartforce s stock and other matters relating to smartforce 
words such as anticipates  expects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates and similar expressions identify such forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted 
actual results may vary because of factors such as product ship schedules  life cycles  terms and conditions  product mix  competitive products and pricing  customer demand  technological shifts  litigation and other issues discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  these forward looking statements reflect management s opinions only as of the date hereof  and we assume no obligation unless required by law to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward looking statements 
risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to those discussed in this section entitled additional risk factors that could affect operating results 
other risks and uncertainties are disclosed in our sec filings 
historical results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results for any other period 
in addition to the other factors identified in this annual report on form k  the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our future operating results and could cause actual events to differ materially from those predicted in our forward looking statements relating to our business 
these risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating smartforce and its business because such factors currently have a significant impact on smartforce s business  operating results and financial condition 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly 
this limits your ability to evaluate our historical financial results and increases the likelihood that our results will fall below market analysts expectations  which could cause the price of our adss to drop rapidly and severely 
we have in the past experienced fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and anticipate that these fluctuations will continue and could intensify in the future 
as a result  we believe that our quarterly revenue  expenses and operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future 
thus  it is likely that in some future quarters our results of operations will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which could have a severe adverse effect on the price of our adss 
for example  our revenue for the quarter ended september  did not increase at a rate comparable to prior quarters 
as a direct result  the trading price of our adss decreased rapidly and significantly  having an extreme adverse effect on the value of an investment in our securities 
our operating results have historically fluctuated  and may in the future continue to fluctuate  as a result of factors  which include the size and timing of new and renewal agreements  the number and size of outsourced virtual university agreements or other agreements providing for professional services or the resale of instructor led training  the mix of revenue between access to hosted content or platform services  up front software licenses  software rentals  professional services  maintenance and resale of third parties products and services  royalty rates  the announcement  introduction and acceptance of new products  product enhancements and technologies by us and our competitors  the mix of sales between our field sales force  our other direct sales channels and our telesales channels  the impact of any unanticipated decline in net revenues in any particular quarter as compared to the relatively fixed nature of our expense levels in the short term  general conditions in our market or the markets served by our customers  general conditions in the us or the international economy  competitive conditions in the industry  the loss of significant customers  delays in availability of existing or new products  product or service quality problems  the spending patterns of our customers  litigation costs and expenses  currency fluctuations  and the length of sales cycles 
the fluctuations in quarterly operating results are likely to be even greater for the combined company than for smartforce alone 
although both companies are dependent on contracts booked each quarter in order to achieve that quarter s revenue and earnings targets  smartforce typically enters each quarter with a significant portion of its expected quarterly revenues although generally not materially more than already under contract 
centra typically enters each quarter with a significantly smaller portion of its expected quarterly revenues already under contract 
the combined company is therefore likely to be even more subject to quarterly fluctuations based on bookings achieved within the quarter than is smartforce prior to the merger 
demand for our products and services may be especially susceptible to adverse economic conditions 
our business and financial performance may be damaged by adverse financial conditions affecting our target customers or by a general weakening of the economy 
some companies may not view training products and services as critical to the success of their businesses 
if these companies experience disappointing operating results  whether as a result of adverse economic conditions  competitive issues or other factors  they may decrease or forego education and training expenditures before limiting their other expenditures 
in addition  the general condition of the economy  and by extension our business  can be affected by social  political and military conditions 
for example  the terrorist events of september  and their aftermath had a material adverse effect on bookings in the second half of it is not possible to predict the outcome of the recent escalation of hostilities between the united states and certain countries and persons related to the events of september the continuation of these hostilities could result in further weakness in the economy which would have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
our experience in selling fully integrated  internet based learning solutions  is relatively limited 
in the fourth quarter of we introduced smartforce e learning  our internet based learning solution 
while the results of our efforts to migrate our business to e learning and market these solutions to our customers have been positive  we have relatively limited experience with these solutions  which makes our historical results of limited value in predicting the potential success of this initiative 
the ultimate success of this initiative will depend on our ability to continue to expand and enhance our e learning infrastructure  to market and sell the new e learning solutions to existing and prospective customers  to host  operate and manage our site  and to attract and retain key management and technical personnel 
we may not be successful in these efforts and the economic terms of any arrangements that might be expected may not be as favorable as the traditional licensing agreements 
we believe that a lack of success in this regard could have a material negative effect on us 
our operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations which may adversely impact our business 
our operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations  based in part on customers annual budgetary cycles and in part on the annual nature of sales quotas 
these seasonal trends have in the past caused revenues in the first quarter of a year to be less  perhaps substantially so  than revenues for the immediately preceding fourth quarter 
we expect that these seasonal trends could continue to adversely affect our revenues 
in addition  we have in past years added significant headcount in the sales and marketing and research and development functions in the first quarter  and to a lesser extent  the second quarter 
because these headcount additions do not immediately contribute significant revenues  our operating margins in the earlier part of the year tend to be significantly lower than in the later parts of the year 
in addition  many technology companies also experience a seasonal downturn in demand during the summer months 
these seasonal trends may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we rely on strategic alliances that may not continue in the future 
we have developed strategic alliances to develop and market many of our products  and we believe that an increasing proportion of our future revenues may be attributable to products developed and marketed through these and other future alliances 
however  these relationships are not exclusive and we may be unable to continue to develop future products through these alliances in a timely fashion or may be unable to negotiate additional alliances in the future on acceptable terms or at all 
the marketing efforts of our partners may also disrupt our direct sales efforts 
our development and marketing partners could pursue their existing or alternative training programs in preference to and in competition with those being developed by us 
in the event that we are unable to maintain or expand our current development and marketing alliances or enter into new development and marketing alliances  our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  we are required to pay royalties to our development and marketing partners on products developed with them  which reduces our gross margins 
we expect that cost of revenues may fluctuate from period to period in the future based upon many factors  including the revenue mix and the timing of expenses associated with development and marketing alliances 
in addition  the collaborative nature of the development process under these alliances may result in longer development times and less control over the timing of product introductions than for e learning offerings developed solely by us 
our strategic alliance partners may from time to time renegotiate the terms of our agreement with them which could result in changes to the royalty or other arrangements that could adversely effect our results of operations 
our success depends on our ability to meet the needs of the rapidly changing market 
the market for interactive education and training is influenced by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and preferences and frequent introductions of new products and services embodying new technologies 
new methods of providing interactive education in a technology based format are being developed and offered in the marketplace  including intranet and internet offerings 
many of these new offerings involve new and different business models and contracting mechanisms 
in addition  multimedia and other product functionality features are being added to educational software 
accordingly  our future success will depend upon the extent to which we are able to develop and implement products which address these emerging market requirements on a cost effective and timely basis 
product development is risky because it is difficult to foresee developments in technology  coordinate technical personnel and identify and eliminate design flaws 
any significant delay in releasing new products could have a material adverse effect on the ultimate success of our products and could reduce sales of predecessor products 
we may not be able to introduce new products on a timely basis 
in addition  new products introduced by us may fail to achieve a significant degree of market acceptance or  once accepted  may fail to sustain viability in the market for any significant period 
if we are unsuccessful in addressing the changing needs of the marketplace due to resource  technological or other constraints  or in anticipating and responding adequately to changes in customers software technology and preferences  our business and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
the success of our e learning strategy depends on the reliability and consistent performance of our information systems and internet infrastructure 
the success of our e learning strategy is highly dependent on the consistent performance of our information systems and internet infrastructure 
if our web site fails for any reason or if we experience any unscheduled down times  even for only a short period of time  our business and reputation could be materially harmed 
we have in the past experienced performance problems and unscheduled downtime  and these problems could recur 
we rely on third parties for proper functioning of our computer infrastructure  delivery of our e learning application and the performance of our destination site 
our systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins  earthquake  financial problems of hosting providers and other events 
any system failures could adversely affect customer usage of our solutions and user traffic results in any future quarters  which could adversely affect our revenues and operating results and harm our reputation with corporate customers  subscribers and partners 
a key element of our strategy is to generate a high volume of traffic to the web site and create a significant subscriber base 
accordingly  the satisfactory performance  reliability and availability of our web site and computer infrastructure is critical to our reputation and ability to attract and retain corporate customers  subscribers and partners 
we cannot accurately project the rate or timing of any increases in traffic to our web site and  therefore  the integration and timing of any upgrades or enhancements required to facilitate any significant traffic increase to the web site are uncertain 
we have in the past experienced difficulties in upgrading our site infrastructure to handle increased traffic  and these difficulties could recur 
the failure to expand and upgrade the web site or any system error  failure or extended down time  could materially harm our business  reputation  financial condition or results of operations 
the internet based e learning market is a developing market  and our business will suffer if e learning is not widely accepted 
the market for e learning is a new and emerging market 
corporate training and education has historically been conducted primarily through classroom instruction and has traditionally been performed by a company s internal personnel 
many companies have invested heavily in their current training solutions 
although technology based training applications have been available for several years  they currently account for only a small portion of the overall training market 
accordingly  our future success will depend upon the extent to which companies adopt technology based solutions and use the internet in connection with their training activities  and the extent to which companies utilize the services or purchase products of third party providers 
many companies that have already invested substantial resources in traditional methods of corporate training may be reluctant to adopt a new strategy that may compete with their existing investments 
even if companies implement technology based training or internet learning solutions  they may still choose to design  develop  deliver or manage all or part of their education and training internally 
if technology based learning and the use of the internet for learning does not become widespread  or if companies do not use the products and services of third parties to develop  deliver or manage their training needs  then our products and services may not achieve commercial success 
we may fail to integrate adequately acquired products  technologies and businesses 
we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities and have made and are likely to make in the future acquisitions that would provide additional product or service offerings  additional industry expertise or an expanded geographic presence 
for example in april we acquired icglobal  providers of industry acclaimed learning management system software 
in august we acquired substantially all of the assets of impaxselling 
com  a sales performance company providing global enterprises with web based learning solutions designed to improve sales and account management performance 
in october we acquired skillscape  a provider of competency management systems 
we may be unable to locate attractive opportunities or acquire any that we locate on attractive terms 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
product and technology acquisitions entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies and products  diversion of management s attention to other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies 
we may be unable to integrate successfully any operations  personnel or products that have been acquired or that might be acquired in the future 
further  the revenues from the acquired businesses may not be sufficient to support the costs associated with those businesses without adversely affecting smartforce s operating margin in the future 
any failure to successfully complete the integration in a timely fashion or to generate sufficient revenues from the acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in january  we announced the proposed merger of centra software and smartforce 
the merger is subject to the fulfillment or waiver of a number of conditions including the approval of the shareholders of smartforce and centra 
if such conditions have been fulfilled or waived  we would expect to close the merger in the second quarter of if such closing conditions have not been fulfilled or waived  the merger will not be consummated 
since announcing the proposed acquisition  smartforce s adss have declined in value  which increases the risk that shareholder approval may not be obtained 
the failure to consummate the merger would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the successful combination of smartforce and centra  including the successful operation of centra as an autonomous subsidiary of smartforce  will require substantial effort from each company 
the diversion of the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the transition process could have an adverse impact on our ability to realize the full benefits of the acquisition 
the successful combination of the two companies will also require coordination of our research and development and sales and marketing efforts 
in addition  the process of combining the two organizations could cause the interruption of  or loss of momentum in  centra s activities 
rapid expansion of our operations could strain our personnel and systems 
we have recently experienced rapid expansion of our operations  which has placed  and is expected to continue to place  significant demands on our executive  administrative  operational and financial personnel and systems 
our future operating results will substantially depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our operational  financial control and reporting systems 
in particular  we require significant improvement in our order entry  fulfillment and management information systems in order to support our expanded operations 
if we are unable to respond to and manage changing business conditions  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our expense levels are fixed in the short term and we may be unable to adjust spending to compensate for unexpected revenue shortfalls 
our expense levels are based in significant part on our expectations regarding future revenues and are fixed to a large extent in the short term 
accordingly  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
any significant revenue shortfall would therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
this risk materialized in the third quarter of  where profit was dramatically negatively affected by a shortfall in revenues as against management s expectations 
we depend on a few key personnel to manage and operate us 
our success is largely dependent on the personal efforts and abilities of our senior management 
failure to retain these executives  or the loss of certain additional senior management personnel or other key employees  could have a material adverse effect on our business and future prospects 
we are also dependent on the continued service of our key sales  content development and operational personnel and on our ability to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified employees 
in addition  we depend on writers  programmers  web designers and graphic artists 
we expect to continue to hire additional content development  programmers  sales and marketing  information systems and accounting staff 
however  we may be unsuccessful in attracting  retaining or motivating key personnel 
the inability to hire and retain qualified personnel or the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect upon our current business  new product development efforts and future business prospects 
increased competition may result in decreased demand for our products and services  which may result in reduced revenues and gross margins and loss of market share 
the market for business education training solutions is highly fragmented and competitive  and is subject to rapid technological change 
we expect that because of the lack of significant barriers to entry into this market  new competitors may enter the market in the future 
in addition to increased competition from new companies entering into the market  established companies are entering into the market  directly and through acquisitions of smaller companies which directly compete with us  and we expect this trend to continue 
we may also face competition from publishing companies and vendors of application software  including those vendors with whom we have formed development and marketing alliances 
we may also face competition from publishing companies and vendors of application software  including those vendors with whom we have formed development and marketing alliances 
our primary source of direct competition comes from third party suppliers of instructor led information technology  business  management and professional skills education and training as well as suppliers of computer or internet based training and e learning solutions 
we also face indirect competition from internal education and training departments of our potential customers 
we also compete to a lesser extent with consultants  value added resellers and network integrators all of which market products that compete with ours 
we expect that as organizations increase their dependence on outside suppliers of training  we will face increasing competition from these other suppliers as education and training managers more frequently compare training products provided by outside suppliers 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our market place are the depth  breadth and variety of content  the ability to offer complete learning solutions  an installed customer base  the size and experience of the sales force offering the solutions  product quality  product functionality  return on investment and cost effectiveness of the solutions 
although we believe that our learning solutions currently compete favorably with respect to these factors  our market is relatively new and is evolving rapidly 
we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors  especially those with significantly greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources 
many of our current and potential competitors also have greater name recognition than we do 
we believe our success will depend on our ability to expand our learning offerings  adopt new technologies and continue to offer the most extensive and educationally rich learning solutions available in our industry 
however  we may be unable to provide products that compare favorably with new instructor led techniques or the learning offerings of our competitors 
competitive pressures may also force us to reduce the prices of our products significantly 
our business is subject to currency fluctuations that can adversely affect our operating results 
due to our multinational operations  our business is subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates between the currencies in which we collect revenues or pay expenses 
in particular  the value of the us dollar against the euro and related currencies impacts our operating results 
our expenses are not necessarily incurred in the currency in which revenue is generated  and  as a result  we are required from time to time to convert currencies to meet our obligations 
these currency conversions are subject to exchange rate fluctuations  and changes to the value of the euro  pound sterling and other currencies relative to the us dollar could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our corporate tax rate may increase  which could adversely affect our cash flow  financial condition and results of operations 
we have significant operations and generate a majority of our taxable income in the republic of ireland  and some of our irish operating subsidiaries are taxed at rates substantially lower than tax rates in effect in the united states and other countries in which we have operations 
if our irish subsidiaries were no longer to qualify for these lower tax rates or if the applicable tax laws were rescinded or changed  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
moreover  because we incur income tax in several countries  an increase in our profitability in one or more of these countries could result in a higher overall tax rate 
in addition  if us or other foreign tax authorities were to change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge the manner in which our subsidiaries profits are currently recognized  our taxes could increase  and our business  cash flow  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 
unauthorized use of our technology may result in development of products or services that compete with ours 
our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our rights in our intellectual property and trade secrets 
we rely upon a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and customer license agreements  and other methods to protect our proprietary rights 
we also enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and third parties to seek to limit and protect the distribution of our proprietary information regarding this technology 
however  we have not signed protective agreements in every case 
although we have taken steps to protect our proprietary technologies  these steps may be inadequate 
existing patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret law offer only limited protection 
moreover  the laws of other countries in which we market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property 
additionally  unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products  services or technology or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
other parties may also breach confidentiality agreements and other protective contracts we have executed 
we may not become aware of  or have adequate remedies in the event of  a breach 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
even if we were to prevail  this litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources 
some may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights  which could result in costly litigation  require us to reengineer or cease sales of our products or services or require us to make royalty payments 
third parties could in the future claim that our current or future products infringe their intellectual property rights 
any claim  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation or require us to reengineer or cease sales of our products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
infringement claims could also result in an injunction in the use of our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
though no legal actions are pending at this time  from time to time we learn of parties that claim broad intellectual property rights in the e learning area that might implicate our offerings 
these parties or others could initiate actions against us in the future 
we are subject to a pending legal proceeding and may become subject to additional proceedings and adverse determinations in these proceedings could harm our business 
since the end of the third quarter of  a class action lawsuit has been pending in the united states district court for the northern district of california against us  one of our subsidiaries  smartforce usa  and certain of our former and current officers and directors  alleging violation of the federal securities laws 
it has been alleged in this lawsuit that we misrepresented or omitted to state material facts regarding our business and financial condition and prospects in order to artificially inflate and maintain the price of our adss  and misrepresented or omitted to state material facts in our registration statement and prospectus issued in connection with our merger with forefront  which also is alleged to have artificially inflated the price of our adss 
we believe that this action is without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves against it 
although we cannot presently determine the outcome of this action  an adverse resolution of this matter could significantly negatively impact our financial position and results of operations 
we may be from time to time involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings  which arise in the ordinary course of business 
an adverse resolution of these matters could significantly negatively impact our financial position and results of operations 
our non us operations are subject to risks which could negatively impact our future operating results 
we expect that international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues  and intend to continue to expand our operations outside of the united states 
operations outside of the united states are subject to inherent risks  including difficulties or delays in developing and supporting non english language versions of our products and services  political and economic conditions in various jurisdictions  in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  longer account receivable payment cycles  potential adverse tax consequences and the absence or significant lack of legal protection for intellectual property rights 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future operations outside of the united states  which could negatively impact our future operating results 
because many users of our e learning solutions access them over the internet  factors adversely affecting the use of the internet could harm our business 
many of our users access our e learning solutions over the internet 
any factors that adversely affect internet usage could disrupt the ability of those users to access our e learning solutions  which would adversely effect customer satisfaction and therefore our business 
for example  our ability to increase the speed and scope of our services to customers is ultimately limited by the speed and reliability of both the internet and our customers internal networks 
consequently  the emergence and growth of the market for our products and services depend upon the improvements being made to the entire internet as well as to our individual customers networking infrastructures to alleviate overloading and congestion 
if these improvements are not made  the ability of our customers to use our products and services will be hindered and our revenues may suffer 
additionally  a requirement for the continued growth of accessing e learning solutions over the internet is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
failure to prevent security breaches into our products or our customers networks  or well publicized security breaches affecting the internet in general could significantly harm our growth and revenue 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we use to protect content and transactions or our products or with our customers networks or proprietary information in our databases 
anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary and confidential information or could cause interruptions in our operations 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to address problems caused by security breaches 
the privacy of users may also deter people from using the internet to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential information the market price for our adss may fluctuate and may not be sustainable 
the market price of our adss has fluctuated significantly since our initial public offering and is likely to continue to be volatile 
we believe that factors  such as the following  could cause the price of our adss to fluctuate  perhaps substantially announcements of developments related to ourselves or our competitors business  announcements of new products or enhancements by ourselves or our competitors  the evolution of the market for live e learning and business collaboration solutions  the success and timing in developing and introducing new products and enhancements to existing products  changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors  the length of our sales cycles  market entry by new competitors  sales of our adss into the public market  developments in our relationships with our customers  partners and distributors  shortfalls or changes in revenues  gross margins  earnings or losses or other financial results which differ from public market expectations  changes in the public market expectation of our performance or industry performance  changes in market valuations of competitors  regulatory developments  additions or departures of key personnel  fluctuations in results of operations  and general conditions in our markets  or the markets served by our customers or in the us and or the international economy 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general  and the market for shares of technology stocks in particular  has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies 
the market price of our adss may continue to experience significant fluctuations in the future  including fluctuations that are unrelated to our performance 
to succeed we must continue to expand our content offerings  upgrade our technology and distinguish our solution 
we may not be able to do successfully 
any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences or any significant delays in content development or implementation could impact our ability to capture market share 
our sales cycles may make it difficult to predict our operating results 
we have long sales cycles because we generally need to educate potential customers regarding the benefits of our e learning products and services prior to sale 
our sales cycles vary depending on the size and type of customer contemplating a purchase and whether we have conducted business with a potential customer in the past 
potential customers frequently need to obtain approvals from multiple decision makers within their organization prior to making purchase decisions
