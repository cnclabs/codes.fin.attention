item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report  which are deemed to be incorporated into this section 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward looking statements due to various factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of web native software products and services that facilitate international buying and selling of goods by streamlining and optimizing global trade processes 
global trade involves the cross border shipment of goods and the management of the information and business processes required to complete these shipments 
in  we introduced ems  a us centric  dos based export management solution 
in  we introduced ems version  a multi country  two tier  windows based export management solution 
in  we introduced global passport  a multi country  three tier  client server based  import export management solution 
in  we introduced tradesphere  a multi country  multi module suite of web native global trade management solutions and we introduced tradeprism 
com  a trade portal that provides an internet based delivery mechanism for our global trade management capabilities 
since our inception  we have continued to develop comprehensive solutions with features  functionality and services that allow companies to manage the complexities of global trade 
we provide our products and services to over clients from our offices in the united states  the united kingdom  mexico and canada 
our clients typically acquire a limited number of server and user subscriptions or licenses to implement in a division or department 
as they expand implementation of our products globally and to their clients  suppliers and business partners  our clients acquire additional subscriptions or licenses 
we currently market our products and services on a global basis through our direct sales force and other channels  such as strategic alliances and partners 
we expect revenues from our international operations to increase as we continue to expand our international sales and services organizations 
in july  we entered into an agreement to acquire ford s global customs operations and merged ford s global customs operations into our managed services operations 
the ford operations that were merged into us consist of ford personnel and technology utilized by ford to manage its international trade transactions 
by combining our existing technology and intellectual capital with that acquired from ford  we intend to expand our managed services to companies of varying sizes on a global basis 
ford received  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million in consideration at the time of the transaction 
as of february   ford owned approximately of our common stock 
in january and march  we expanded the global trade management services we provide to ford motor company by assuming responsibility for administering and managing ford s global trade operations in mexico and canada  respectively 
the contractual terms relating to negotiating managed services arrangements with other foreign operations have not been finalized and are subject to negotiation based upon the actual costs 
these costs include personnel costs  administrative overhead and information technology processing costs 
our agreements with ford have a minimum term of four years 
these agreements provide us with a guaranteed  predictable and recurring revenue stream from ford over the next three to four years 
we expect to derive at least million in revenues in and from our agreements with ford us  ford mexico and ford canada 
our client relationship with ford will have a significant impact on our total revenues and is expected to account for greater than of revenues for the foreseeable future 
for the years ended december  and  ford accounted for approximately and of our total revenues  respectively 
in february  we amended our agreement with ford us to provide for quarterly minimum transaction levels instead of annual minimum transaction levels 
by amending this agreement  we can now bill on a quarterly basis the transactions processed in excess of the minimum levels 
in connection with the amendment  we agreed to reduce ford s us aggregate annual minimum revenue guarantee from million to million 
in december  we permitted ford us to carry forward a portion of the transactions processed for ford us in in excess of the contractual minimum in the event that transaction processed in the first quarter of are less than the contractual minimum 
we do not expect this amendment to have a significant effect on our results of operations 
we are compensated for our services provided to ford based on the number of transactions executed  subject to certain minimum transaction levels through a transaction  also known as a customs entry  or the equivalent in other geographic regions  is a declaration for imported goods imported from ford  under once conveyance  on one day 
each request submitted for the shipment of goods becomes a customs entry at the time the shipment enters the commerce of a nation 
although ford has a limited ability to manage the number of transactions we process  based on customs regulations and ford s just in time production process  opportunities to combine multiple transactions into one customs entry are limited and not employed by ford in the customs clearance of goods 
acquisitions in addition to the acquisition of the ford s global customs operations described above  on march   we acquired speedchain  a development stage company with no revenues since its inception in speedchain is a supply chain event management and global e logistics solutions provider 
the acquisition was effected through the merger of speedchain into one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  vastera acquisition corporation 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the operating results of speedchain have been included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  we issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding preferred stock and common stock of speedchain 
the shares of common stock issued by us were valued at per share  the average of the closing prices for the three days before and three days after march  we also issued options to acquire approximately  shares of our common stock in exchange for the vested speedchain stock options we assumed in the business combination 
the options were valued at approximately  using the black scholes model  assuming volatility  a risk free interest rate of  and an exercise period of three years 
on march   we also issued options to acquire approximately  shares of our common stock in exchange for the unvested speedchain stock options assumed in the business combination 
accordingly  we recorded  of deferred compensation that will be amortized on an accelerated basis over the remaining vesting period of these options 
we valued in process research and development ipr d projects acquired in the acquisition at approximately million  based on the results of an independent appraisal of the development projects for which technological feasibility has not been established and no alternative future uses exist 
the acquired ipr d projects are targeted at the supply chain event management and e logistics market 
the value of the ipr d projects identified was determined by estimating the future cash flows from each of the respective projects at the assumed date of commercial feasibility  discounting these net cash flows back to their present value and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated present value 
the percentage of completion for the projects were determined using milestones representing management s estimate of effort  value added and degree of difficulty of the portion of the projects completed as of march   as compared to the remaining research and development to be completed to bring the projects to technical feasibility 
speedchain s projects started in february and  as of march   we estimated the projects were complete 
development of the speedchain technology remains a substantial risk to us due to factors that include the remaining effort necessary to achieve technical feasibility  rapidly changing customer needs and competitive threats from other companies 
failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could adversely affect future sales and profitability of the combined company 
additionally  the value of the other intangible assets acquired may become impaired 
in june  we acquired quantum consulting associates  inc quantum of denver  colorado to enhance our trade process consulting services and trade expertise 
the shareholders of quantum received an aggregate of  in cash and  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million  in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of quantum 
in january  we acquired deltac limited  a provider of trade content and management consulting expertise for the united kingdom and european union 
the shareholders of deltac received an aggregate of  in cash and  shares of our common stock valued at  in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of deltac 
the acquisitions of speedchain  quantum  deltac and ford s global customs operations were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the excess of the consideration over the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities related to our quantum and deltac acquisitions of approximately million was accounted for as goodwill 
the excess of the consideration over the fair value of the acquired assets of ford s global customs operations that has been accounted for as goodwill and identifiable intangibles is estimated to be million and million  respectively 
goodwill and identifiable intangibles have been amortized on a straight line basis over three to four years and resulted in charges to operations of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and on january   in accordance with sfas no 
 we reclassified our assembled workforce intangible assets to goodwill 
on january  we adopted the nonamortization approach under sfas no 
for our goodwill 
as of january  we expect to have unamortized goodwill of approximately million 
in the aggregate  amortization for future periods is expected to be approximately  for the years ending december  and and approximately  for the year ending december  critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  deferred revenues and intangible assets to be critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
source of revenues and revenue recognition policy our revenues are classified as either subscription transaction revenues or services revenues 
subscription transaction revenues subscription transaction revenues consist of subscription based revenues  transaction based revenues and perpetual software license revenues 
subscription based revenues 
subscription based revenues are derived from term license arrangements in which our clients license tradesphere and tradeprism 
com for a contract term and obtain the right to unspecified enhancements on a when and if available basis  ongoing support and content update services  for the term of the arrangement 
revenues are recognized ratably over the contract term 
terms of subscription arrangements typically range from three to five years 
payments on subscription arrangements are collected annually  quarterly or monthly 
transaction based revenues 
transaction based revenues are derived from agreements that provide for transaction fees based on a client s usage of tradesphere or tradeprism 
com software products or on the performance of our managed services solutions 
revenues are recognized from the usage of our software products as transactions occur 
managed services solutions include the processing of our clients custom entries and the classification of our clients goods 
managed services transaction arrangements are often subject to annual or quarterly minimum transaction thresholds and revenues have been recognized based on the lower of the cumulative actual transactions processed using a weighted average transaction rate or the amount billable for the period 
for those managed services transaction arrangements that are subject to annual minimums and the amount billable for interim periods is limited to the pro rata portion of the annual minimum  transactions processed in excess of the minimum in each interim period are not billable until the end of the annual period 
in addition  vastera may receive annual gainsharing fees under certain managed services transaction arrangements based on a percentage of the client s annual cost savings  as defined in the managed services arrangements 
payments on transaction revenues are typically collected monthly 
perpetual software license revenues 
perpetual software license revenues are derived from sales of perpetual software licenses under which our clients license tradesphere and tradeprism 
com and the related maintenance contracts 
maintenance contracts include the right to unspecified enhancements on a when and if available basis  ongoing support and content update services 
the content updates provided under maintenance arrangements are significant and frequent and thus the entire arrangement is in substance a subscription 
revenues from perpetual software license sales are recognized ratably over the estimated economic life of the product 
we have estimated that the life of the product is three years  which is consistent with the historical periods between major upgrades to the functionality and architecture of our products such that we would charge all customers a new fee to migrate to the new version 
revenues from maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the contract term  typically one year 
payments on maintenance revenues are typically collected annually in advance  but may also be collected quarterly in advance 
services revenues our services revenues consist of tradesphere services revenues and trade management consulting revenues 
tradesphere services revenues 
tradesphere services revenues are derived from implementation and training services 
these revenues are provided on either a time and materials or on a fixed price basis and are recognized as the services are performed or on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
losses on arrangements are recognized when known 
trade management consulting revenues 
trade management consulting revenues are derived from management consulting services 
these revenues are provided on either a time and materials or on a fixed price basis and are recognized as the services are performed or on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
deferred revenues deferred revenues include amounts billed to clients for revenues that have not been recognized and generally result from billed  but deferred subscription transaction revenues and services not yet rendered 
deferred revenues will be recognized on a monthly basis over the term or the remaining economic life of the product or when the services are performed 
as we continue to increase our subscription and transaction based revenues relative to our perpetual licenses  we expect our deferred revenues to fluctuate since subscription and transaction based customers are billed and pay ratably monthly or quarterly 
we do not consider deferred revenue to be a good indicator of future revenues 
intangible assets as of december  we have intangible assets recorded of approximately million related to our  and acquisitions 
goodwill related to the acquisitions is amortized using the straight line method over years 
intangible assets from our acquisition of ford s global customs unit in consists of goodwill  assembled workforce  acquired technology and the ford contract are amortized using the straight line method over to years 
the value assigned to the ford contract is being amortized as a discount to revenue over the minimum term of the contract 
the value assigned to the assembled workforce has been allocated to each country in which the company will acquire ford s global customs operations  based on the number of employees in each country 
the related amortization is recorded on a straight line basis over three years from the date the company assumes ford s customs operations in each country 
goodwill related to the ford acquisition is amortized using the straight line method over four years 
the assembled workforce intangible asset and goodwill from our speedchain acquisition in are amortized using the straight line method over two and fours years  respectively 
for the years ended december   and we recorded amortization expense related to our goodwill and intangibles of approximately  million  and million respectively 
on january   in accordance with sfas no 
 we reclassified our assembled workforce intangible assets to goodwill 
as of january   we expect to have unamortized goodwill of approximately million 
on january   we adopted the nonamortization approach under sfas no 
for our goodwill 
under the nonamortization approach  goodwill will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead will be reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill is more than its fair value 
in the aggregate  amortization of goodwill and assembled workforce for the year ended december  was approximately million 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on our results of operations 
the recoverability and useful lives of our intangible assets are based on estimates and are susceptible to change 
although we believe our intangible assets will be recoverable  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability 
we continue to monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations

total revenues increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  subscription transaction revenues 
subscription transaction revenues increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  we attribute this increase to the expansion of the global trade managed services contract with ford into mexico and canada  the months of revenue earned in under the ford us agreement compared to four months in  and the continued growth in our automotive and high tech managed services client base

the cost of subscription transaction revenues increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was largely due to our investment in our client support infrastructure and the growth of our managed services client base

we expect to realize productivity improvements from our investment in our support infrastructure and the leveraging of personnel in the performance of our managed services agreements 
as we enter into large multi year managed services agreements in new industry verticals or new geographic regions that may require significant investments in the related infrastructure  the costs associated with these managed services agreements may be greater in the initial year than in the later years as we realize productivity improvements from these infrastructure investments 
accordingly  we expect that our cost of subscription transaction revenues may fluctuate as a percentage of subscription transaction revenues quarterly

our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the costs and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  the costs and timing of product development efforts and the success of these development efforts  the extent to which our existing and new products and services gain market acceptance  the level and timing of revenues  the costs involved in maintaining and enforcing intellectual property rights  the timing of market developments  and available borrowings under line of credit and capital lease arrangements 
in addition  we may use cash resources to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies 
we believe that our current cash resources will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital requirements for at least the next months 
thereafter  we may find it necessary to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
in the event that additional financing is required  we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
the company reimburses ford for certain expenses in connection with the acquisition of ford s global customs operations 
the company expects to pay approximately  in fees to ford each month for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by ford for the use of facilities  the costs of leased employees and the maintenance and expenses related to the acquired technology 
we expect these payments to decrease as we leverage our existing facilities and deploy our technology 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
recorded goodwill and intangibles will be evaluated against these new criteria and may result in certain intangibles being subsumed into goodwill  or alternatively  amounts initially recorded as goodwill may be separately identified and recognized apart from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires the use of a nonamortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles 
under a nonamortization approach  goodwill and certain intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead will be reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its fair value 
on january   in accordance with sfas no 
 we reclassified our assembled workforce intangible assets to goodwill 
on january  we adopted the nonamortization approach under sfas no 
for our goodwill 
in the aggregate  amortization for the year ended december  was approximately million 
as of january  we expect to have unamortized goodwill of approximately million 
in the aggregate  amortization for future periods is expected to be approximately  for the years ending december  and and approximately  for the year ending december  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on our results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
it requires an entity to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
if a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period the asset retirement obligation is incurred  the liability shall be recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
this new standard is effective in the first quarter of we do not believe that sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
 and accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
is effective in the first quarter of we do not believe that sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial statements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the united states and market our products in north america  and to a lesser extent  europe  canada  mexico and the asia pacific region 
accordingly  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as a majority of sales are currently made in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
we do not expect any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to movements in any specific foreign currency 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses of our european  mexican or canadian subsidiaries 
we intend to assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
we have existing obligations relating to amounts outstanding under our equipment line of credit and amounts borrowed under capital lease arrangements 
these financial instruments expose us to interest rate risk as our lending institution changes its prime rate 
as disclosed in note of our consolidated financial statements  which are included as part of this form k  we have approximately million in variable rate debt as of december  the significant terms of our debt facilities are fully disclosed in note of the consolidated financials statements 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material risk exposure 
we do not hold or issue derivative securities  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required 
we have a substantial amount of intangible assets 
although as of december   we believe our intangible assets will be recoverable  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability 
we continue to monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets
