item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company s primary business is attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those deposits and other borrowed funds in loans  mortgage backed securities  us government securities and other securities 
the company originates commercial  consumer  and mortgage loans for investment  and mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market 
mortgage loan sales are made from mortgage loans held in the company s portfolio designated as being held for sale or originated for sale during the period 
the company s revenues are derived principally from interest on its loans  and to a lesser extent  dividends and interest on its investments and mortgage backed securities  fees and loan servicing income 
the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans and mortgage backed securities  proceeds from the sale of loans  fhlb advances  and other borrowings

acquisition on february   the company completed the people s acquisition for million in cash and million shares of the company s common stock 
the people s acquisition was accounted for as purchase in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and the total cost  including the fair value of stock options assumed and certain merger costs  was million 
the company recorded goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million in connection with the acquisition 
the results of people s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since march  critical accounting policies certain aspects of the company s accounting policies are based on management s estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
management has identified five policies that  due to such estimates  assumptions and judgments inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
these policies involve management s methodology for the determination of the company s allowance for loan losses  purchase accounting  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  the valuation of derivatives and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
these policies and the estimates  assumptions and judgments are described in greater detail in subsequent sections of management s discussion and analysis and in the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein 
management believes that the estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements were appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time 
however  given the sensitivity of the company s consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies  the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments could have resulted in material variances from the reported results of operations or financial condition 
impact of new accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
certain disclosure provisions required by sfas no 
were effective immediately  with additional requirements related to sfas no 
effective beginning march  the adoption of sfas no 
had no effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and specifies recognition criteria that acquired identifiable intangible assets must meet to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead are to be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
and subsequently  sfas no 
after its adoption 
the company adopted sfas no 
as of july  also as of july   the company adopted the required transition provisions of sfas no 
related to amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets for which the acquisition date was after june  the remaining provisions of sfas no 
were adopted on april  accordingly  goodwill and other intangible assets related to the people s acquisition are not amortized 
goodwill acquired in business combinations completed before july  continued to be amortized until march  upon full adoption of sfas no 
 the company must evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in purchase business combinations  and make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the criteria in sfas no 
for recognition of identifiable intangible assets separate from goodwill 
the company must also reassess the useful lives and residual values of all identifiable intangible assets acquired and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by june  goodwill impairment must be measured for each reporting unit in a two step process 
first  the carrying amount of the net assets including goodwill must be compared to the fair value of a reporting unit as defined by september  second  if the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value  the company must determine by march  the amount of impairment based on the fair value of a reporting unit compared to the fair values assigned to all of the recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of that unit 
impairment must be measured as of the adoption date of april   with the related loss  if necessary  recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal year on march   the company had goodwill in the amount of million  a core deposit intangible asset of million and non compete intangible asset of  all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas no 
the company has not completed its calculations under the impairment testing provisions of sfas  however  impairment losses  if any  are not expected to be material 
the estimated amortization expense for goodwill and other intangible assets for fiscal year is expected to increase to million from  in fiscal year due to amortization of the other intangible assets recorded in connection with the people s acquisition  partially offset by discontinuing all goodwill amortization  subject to the results of the required testing for goodwill impairment 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
sfas no 
requires companies to separately report discontinued operations and extend that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
the company adopted sfas no

declining market interest rates and related consumer preferences resulted in the company s shift to origination of fixed rate mortgages that are generally sold in the secondary market  from origination of adjustable rate mortgages that are generally retained for portfolio 
in addition  prepayment speeds on mortgage loans increased due primarily to refinancing activity 
this economic environment  combined with the company s business development and cross selling efforts  contributed to growth in commercial and consumer loans and deposits 
the decline in fhlb advances and other borrowings reflected a greater reliance on deposits for funding balance sheet growth  while borrowing costs also declined 
the growth in investment and mortgage backed securities resulted from management s strategy to maintain the company s leverage in fiscal year lastly  the company completed the people s acquisition on february  the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company at fiscal year end and for fiscal years  and the average yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown

non interest income non interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march   following an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended march  the increase during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was due primarily to increases of million in gain loss on sale of mortgage loans  net  million of gain on sale of securities available for sale   in service charges on deposit accounts   in trust fee income and  in other non interest income  partially offset by a decrease in loan servicing income of  the increase in gain on sale of mortgage loans was due primarily to a higher volume of fixed rate loans originated for sale and more favorable loan pricing during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year in addition  an increase in the gain of  for fiscal year was recognized as a result of changes in fair value of derivative instruments utilized in secondary market hedging activities following the adoption of sfas no 
on april  the increase in service charges on deposit accounts reflects a higher fee rate structure and the increase in trust fee income was due to continued growth at the trust company 
the increase in other non interest income was due primarily to increases in other fee income  and an increase in the fair value of investments in certain employee benefit plans  which is offset by a corresponding increase in other non interest expense 
also  changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps resulted in an addition to other non interest income of  for fiscal year following the adoption of sfas no 
the decrease in loan servicing income included a  addition to the valuation allowance for mortgage servicing rights during the second quarter of fiscal year based on estimated impairment due to a combination of faster than previously expected actual payoff experience and faster prepayment forecasts in september versus june the balance of the valuation allowance amounted to  at march  and  at march  amortization of mortgage servicing rights totaled million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was due primarily to a million increase in gain loss on sale of mortgage loans  net and increases in trust fee income of million  insurance commission income of  and services charges on deposit accounts of  partially offset by decreases in loan servicing income of  and other non interest income of  the increase in the trust fee income was due to the first full year of operations of the trust company  which opened in february the increase in insurance commission income was due primarily to additional business resulting from the purchase of two insurance agencies by the agency in march the decrease in loan servicing income was due primarily to a decline in the company s loans serviced for others during fiscal year  and a  reduction in the valuation reserve for mortgage servicing rights during fiscal year the decrease in other non interest income was due primarily to reductions in the fair value of investments in certain employee benefit plans 
non interest expense total non interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for year ended march   following an increase of million  or  from million for year ended march  the increase during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was due primarily to increases in compensation and benefits of million  data processing of  amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets of  and other non interest expense of  these increases were partially offset by decreases in advertising and business promotion of  total non interest expenses for fiscal year included costs associated with the company s new banking and insurance office in middletown  rhode island that opened in january  and operating and acquisition related expenses recognized in march following the people s acquisition 
in addition  the increases in compensation and benefits included the net accounting impact of market price increases of fab stock held by certain employee benefit plans

income taxes income tax expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march   following an increase of  or  from million for the year ended march  these increases were due primarily to increased income before income tax expense 
the company s effective tax rate increased to for the year ended march   compared to for the year ended march  and for the year ended march   due primarily to the effects of an increase in the statutory federal income tax rate based on a higher taxable earnings threshold and increased state taxes 
extraordinary loss during march  the company pre paid federal home loan bank advances and other borrowings totaling million  which resulted in an after tax extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt of  or per share

reports listing all delinquent accounts are generated and reviewed by management on a monthly basis and the board of directors performs a monthly review of all loans or lending relationships delinquent days or more and all real estate owned reo 
the procedures taken by the company with respect to delinquencies vary depending on the nature of the loan  term and cause of delinquency and whether the borrower is habitually delinquent 
when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan  the company takes a number of steps to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status 
the company generally sends the borrower a written notice of non payment after the loan is first past due 
the company s guidelines provide that telephone  written correspondence and or face to face contact will be attempted to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects of repayment 
when contact is made with the borrower at any time prior to foreclosure  the company will attempt to obtain full payment  offer to provide budget and finance counseling services  work out a repayment schedule with the borrower to avoid foreclosure or  in some instances  accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
in the event payment is not then received or the loan is not otherwise satisfied  additional letters and telephone calls are generally made 
if the loan is still not brought current or satisfied and it becomes necessary for the company to take legal action  which typically occurs after a loan is days or more delinquent  the company will commence foreclosure proceedings against any real property that secures the loan 
if a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current  paid in full  or refinanced before the foreclosure sale  the property securing the loan generally is sold at foreclosure and  if purchased by the company  becomes reo 
federal regulations and the company s credit risk review policy require that the company utilize an internal asset classification system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem assets 
the company has incorporated the ots internal asset classifications as a part of its credit monitoring system 
the company currently classifies problem and potential problem assets as substandard  doubtful or loss assets 
an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the credit weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories  but possess weaknesses  are required to be designated special mention 
when an insured institution classifies one or more assets  or portions thereof  as substandard or doubtful  it is required to establish a general valuation allowance for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management 
general valuation allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities  but which  unlike specific allowances  have not been allocated to particular problem assets 
when an insured institution classifies one or more assets  or portions thereof  as loss  it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount 
a savings institution s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the ots which can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances 
the ots  in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies  has adopted an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of management for the assessment and establishment of adequate allowances and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation guidelines 
generally  the policy statement recommends that institutions have effective systems and controls to identify  monitor and address asset quality problems  that management has analyzed all significant factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio in a reasonable manner  and that management has established acceptable allowance evaluation processes that meet the objectives set forth in the policy statement 
although management believes that  based on information currently available to it at this time  its allowance for loan losses is adequate  actual losses are dependent upon future events and  as such  further additions to the level of allowances for loan losses may become necessary 
the company s credit risk review committee reviews and classifies the company s assets on a quarterly basis and the board of directors reviews the reports on a quarterly basis 
the company classifies assets in accordance with the management guidelines described above 
at march   the company had million of assets designated as substandard  including million of trust preferred investment securities acquired in the people s acquisition  and million of loans 
as of march   the company had loans totaling million designated as special mention 
these loans are designated as special mention because of inherent weaknesses that currently exist  but might be correctable in a twelve month cycle 
accordingly  they require additional monitoring

loans include loans receivable  net  excluding allowance for loan losses 
non accrual loans consist of all loans days or more past due and other loans that have been identified by the company as presenting uncertainty with respect to the collectibility of interest or principal 
the million increase in non performing assets during fiscal year was due primarily to assets acquired in the people s acquisition  including million of non accrual residential loans   of commercial and commercial real estate non accrual loans  a million non performing investment and  of real estate owned 
the non performing investment was sold in april impaired loans 
impaired loans are commercial and commercial real estate loans for which it is probable that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the definition of impaired loans is not the same as the definition of non accrual loans  although the two categories overlap 
non accrual loans include impaired loans and are those on which the accrual of interest is discontinued when collectibility of principal or interest is uncertain or payments of principal or interest have been contractually past due days 
the company may choose to place a loan on non accrual status due to payment delinquency or uncertain collectibility  while not classifying the loan as impaired  if it is probable that the company will collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status and collateral value 
impairment is determined by the difference between the present value of the expected cash flows related to the loan  using the original contractual interest rate  and its recorded value  or  in the case of collateral dependent loans  the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the recorded amount of the loan 
when foreclosure is probable  impairment is measured based on the fair value of the collateral 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and insignificant shortfalls in payment amounts generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
at march  and  total impaired loans of  and million required impairment allowances of  and  respectively 
impaired loans of  and  were on non accrual at march  and  respectively 
during fiscal year end  the average recorded value of impaired loans was million 
for these loans   of interest income was recognized while  of interest income would have been recognized under the original terms 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s ongoing review and estimate of the credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management s methodology to estimate loss exposure inherent in the portfolio includes analysis of individual loans deemed to be impaired  performance of individual loans in relation to contract terms  and allowance allocations for various loan types based on payment status or loss experience 
an unallocated allowance is also maintained within an established range based on management s assessment of many factors including current market conditions  trends in loan delinquencies and charge offs  the volume and mix of new originations  and the current type  mix  changing risk profiles and balance of the portfolio 
in addition  the ots and the fdic  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to make additional provisions for estimated loan losses based upon judgments different from those of management 
the allowance for loan losses was million  or of loans receivable  at march   compared to million  or loans receivable  at march  the increase of million  or  included the allowance for loan losses of million assumed with the people s acquisition 
management was influenced by several key factors as a basis for maintaining the level of the company s provisions for loan losses  which resulted in increases in the balance of the allowance for loan losses and as a percent of the total loan portfolio during fiscal year although the company s non performing loans and charge offs have remained low  there has been a significant shift in the composition of the loan portfolio during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the residential mortgage portfolio has decreased due primarily to a low fixed rate environment  which resulted in high refinancing activity  while the commercial and consumer loan portfolios have shown significant growth 
commercial and consumer loans bear a higher degree of risk than the one to four family mortgage loans that make up substantially all of the company s residential portfolio 
in addition  management believes that current economic conditions  including rising unemployment rates in its key market area of southeastern new england  could have an adverse affect on asset quality and result in higher non performing loans and charge offs 
the company will continue to monitor and modify its allowances for loan losses as conditions dictate 
while management believes the company s allowance for loan losses was sufficient to absorb losses inherent in its loan portfolio at march   no assurances can be given that the company s level of allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to cover future loan losses incurred by the company or that future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses will not be necessary if economic and other conditions differ substantially from the economic and other conditions used by management to determine the current level of the allowance for loan losses

the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate given the company s business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with board of directors approved guidelines 
through such management  the company seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates 
the company monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operating strategies 
the company s board of directors has established an asset liability committee  responsible for reviewing its asset liability policies and interest rate risk position  which meets on a monthly basis and reports trends and interest rate risk position to the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of the company 
the company has primarily utilized the following strategies to manage interest rate risk emphasizing the origination and retention of adjustable rate and shorter term generally ten years or less fixed rate  one to four family mortgage loans  selling in the secondary market longer term  fixed rate mortgage loans originated while generally retaining the servicing rights on such loans  and investing primarily in adjustable rate mortgage backed securities and short term fixed rate cmos 
in conjunction with its mortgage banking activity  the company uses forward contracts in order to reduce exposure to interest rate risk 
the amount of forward coverage of the pipeline of mortgages is managed on a day to day basis by an operating officer  within board approved policy guidelines  based on the company s assessment of the general direction of interest rates and levels of mortgage origination activity 
in addition  the company has engaged in interest rate swap agreements to synthetically lengthen its liability maturities 
the company s interest rate risk is monitored by management through the use of a model that generates estimates of the change in the company s net interest income and net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio  under any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the estimated market value of assets in the same scenario 
the ots produces a similar analysis for the bank using its own model  based upon data submitted on the bank s quarterly thrift financial report  the results of which may vary from the company s internal model primarily due to differences in assumptions utilized between the company s internal model and the ots model  including estimated loan prepayment rates  reinvestment rates and deposit renewal rates 
the following table sets forth the company s estimated npv and npv ratios as of march  and  as calculated by the company 
march  march  change in estimated npv estimated npv interest rates net sensitivity net sensitivity in basis portfolio npv board in basis portfolio npv in basis points value ratio limits points value ratio points dollars in thousands unchanged   certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv require certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv model presented incorporates an assumption that the composition of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured  and that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the term to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv measurements and net interest income models provide an indication of the company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to  and do not  provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the company s net interest income 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans and mortgage backed securities  proceeds from the sale of loans  fhlb advances  and other borrowings 
in addition  the company acquired cash in people s acquisition during fiscal year while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
during fiscal year  the company used cash acquired in the people s acquisition to fund asset growth and repay certain fhlb advances and other borrowings 
however  the company expects to use to deposits and fhlb advances and other borrowings to fund asset growth in the future  depending on market conditions  the pricing of deposit products  and the pricing of fhlb advances and other borrowings 
the company s most liquid assets are cash  short term investments  mortgage loans held for sale  investment securities available for sale  and mortgage backed securities available for sale 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the company s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at march   cash  short term investments  mortgage loans held for sale  investment securities available for sale  and mortgage backed securities available for sale totaled million  or of total assets 
the company has other sources of liquidity if a need for additional funds arises  including a million fhlb secured line of credit  fhlb advances  and other borrowings 
at march   the company had million in advances outstanding from the fhlb and other borrowings  and an additional borrowing capacity from the fhlb of million including the million line of credit 
at march   the portfolio of putable fhlb advances and reverse repurchase agreements totaled million  with an average interest rate of  an average life to maturity of years and an expected average life of years 
the expected average life calculated by the bank may or may not mirror the counter party s actual decision to exercise its option to terminate the advances 
the fhlb is required by regulation to offer replacement funding to the bank if the fhlb terminates a putable advance prior to the maturity date of the advance  provided that the bank is able to satisfy the fhlb s normal credit and collateral requirements 
such replacement funding would be for the remaining maturity of the putable advance  and at a market interest rate or a predetermined interest rate agreed upon between the bank and the fhlb 
the company has two subsidiary business trusts acquired as part of the people s acquisition  capital trust i and capital trust ii  of which the company owns all of the common securities 
at march  capital trust i had million of trust preferred securities outstanding that mature in june unless the company elects and obtains regulatory approval to accelerate the maturity date to as early as june capital trust ii had million of trust preferred securities outstanding that mature in july unless the company elects and obtains regulatory approval to accelerate the maturity date to as early as july on may   the company announced the redemption of the capital trust i preferred securities  at par  on june  at march   the company had commitments to originate loans and unused outstanding lines of credit and undistributed balances of construction loans totaling million

certificate of deposit accounts scheduled to mature in less than one year from march  totaled million 
the company expects that it will retain a majority of maturing certificate accounts 
the company plans to open a new banking office in east greenwich  rhode island in the second quarter of fiscal year  bringing total banking offices to the company continues to consider sites for new banking offices and loan origination centers in or adjacent to its market area 
in addition  the company may  from time to time  consider expanding its market share and or market area through the acquisition of assets or other banking institutions and may consider acquisitions of other types of financial services companies 
the establishment of additional banking offices  loan origination centers  trust service operations  mergers and acquisitions  and additional capital management strategies by the company would result in additional capital expenditures and other associated costs which the company has not yet estimated 
at march   the consolidated capital to total assets ratio of the company was 
the company paid one dividend and three dividends to stockholders during the fiscal year the company s primary source of funding for these dividends  and payments for periodic stock repurchases  has been dividends from the bank 
the bank s ability to pay dividends and other capital distributions to the company is generally limited by ots regulations
