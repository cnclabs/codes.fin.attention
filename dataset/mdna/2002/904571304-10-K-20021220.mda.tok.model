as a result  the company s daily operations generally do not require large amounts of working capital 
from time to time  the company utilizes portions of its cash to acquire and construct new stores and renovate existing locations 
as of september   the company amended its revolving credit agreement to revise covenants relating to interest and fixed charge coverage ratios for the fourth quarter of fiscal year and the first quarter of fiscal year the company and the bank are currently evaluating revisions to the fixed charge coverage covenant and interest coverage covenant for the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal year that will be consistent with the company s strategic course 
while the bank has indicated that it intends to negotiate revisions to the credit agreement  in good faith  that may be necessary  there can be no assurance that such revisions will be agreed to or that the company will be in compliance with the existing or amended covenants under the agreement during fiscal year at september   million was available for borrowing under this agreement 
see footnote f to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding the revolving credit

these capital expenditures include replacement of store equipment and gasoline dispensing equipment and upgrading of the company s data processing systems

management believes that cash from operations  available credit facilities and asset sales will be sufficient to meet the company s obligations for the foreseeable future 
in the event that the company is unable to amend covenants under its revolving credit agreement or cannot consummate proposed asset sales  there is a risk that the company will not be able to meet future cash obligations 
there can be no assurance that the company s lenders will cooperate with the company s efforts to pay down debt through the divestiture of assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to self insured liabilities  impairment and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience  current and anticipated business conditions  the condition of the financial markets  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under existing conditions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements self insurance liabilities the company records estimates for self insured worker s compensation and general liability insurance coverage 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or costs increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded 
impairment the company evaluates long lived assets  including stores  for impairment quarterly  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable 
the impairment is measured by calculating the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the store  and comparing this amount to the carrying value of the store s assets 
cash flows are calculated utilizing individual store forecasts and total company projections for the remaining estimated lease lives of the stores being analyzed 
should actual results differ from those forecasted and projected  the company may be subject to future impairment charges related to these facilities 
during fiscal year  the company is required to adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas nos 
and sfas no 
requires that assets with indefinite lives not be amortized but tested annually for impairment and provides specific guidance for such testing 
sfas no 
provides additional guidance for impairment testing and determination of when an asset is considered to be for sale 
at this time  the company has not determined the impact these standards will have on its financial statements  but believes the adoption of sfas no 
will result in a material write off of goodwill 
goodwill at september  was  income taxes the company currently has net operating loss nol carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future income for federal and state tax purposes 
these nols generate a significant deferred tax asset 
however  the company has recorded a valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset as it has determined that it is more likely than not that it will not be able to fully utilize the nols 
should the company s assumptions regarding the utilization of these nols change  it may reduce some or all of this valuation allowance  which would result in the recording of an income tax benefit 
impact of inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its results of operations in recent years 
generally  increases in the company s cost of merchandise can be quickly reflected in higher prices of goods sold 
however  any upward movement of gasoline costs may have short term negative effects on profit margins  since the company s ability to raise gasoline prices can be limited due to competition from other self service gasoline outlets 
in addition  fluctuation of gasoline prices can limit the ability of the company to maintain stable gross margins
