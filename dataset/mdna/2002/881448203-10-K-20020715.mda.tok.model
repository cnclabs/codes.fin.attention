item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of results of operations and financial condition is based upon and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  the selected financial data and other financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are an internationally recognized multinational facilitator of internet connectivity and provider of internet infrastructure and managed services 
we are the owner and operator of the nap of the americas  the fifth tier network access point in the world 
the nap of the americas  the first terrenap sm data center  and the only carrier neutral tier network access point  or nap  is located in miami  florida and provides peering  colocation and managed services to carriers  internet service providers  and other internet companies and enterprises 
the nap of the americas provides a neutral connection point where telecommunications carriers can establish bilateral and multilateral connections between and among their networks  a process known as peering  and purchase capacity from each other 
the nap of the americas also provides premium class space where carriers  internet service providers  application service providers  content providers  internet businesses  telecommunications providers and enterprises house their equipment and their network facilities in order to be close to the peering connections that take place at the nap 
this is known as colocation 
in addition  the nap of the americas provides a menu of related managed services  such as meet point rooms 
we expect that the nap of the americas will be a primary channel of internet traffic from central and south america and the caribbean to north america and europe 
as a result of changes in our business conditions  including market changes in the telecommunications industry and the lack of debt and equity financing vehicles to fund other business expansion during the third quarter of the year ended march   we began to redefine and focus our terrenap data center strategy  and began implementing a plan to exit all lines of business not directly related to this strategy 
lines of business discontinued include ip fax services  unified messaging services  and telephony 
as of march   we have completed our exit of lines of business not related to our terrenap data center strategy 
this change in focus has impacted the composition of the financial revenues for the years ending march  and march  we were founded in on april   terremark holdings  inc completed a reverse merger with amtec  inc  a public company 
contemporaneous with the reverse merger we changed our corporate name to terremark worldwide  inc and adopted tww as our trading symbol on the american stock exchange 
historical information of the surviving company is that of terremark holdings  inc critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses terremark worldwide inc s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenues and collectibility of receivables  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following significant accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and allowance for bad debts  accounting for income taxes  accounting for property and equipment  and impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of 
revenue recognition and allowance for bad debts 
revenue is recognized as service is provided when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
in addition  an allowance is provided for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments for those customers that we had expected to collect the revenues 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if they become insolvent  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  allowances for doubtful accounts may be required  which would decrease net income in the period the determination was made 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes current economic news and trends  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating revenue recognition and the adequacy of our allowances 
data center revenues currently consist of monthly recurring fees for colocation and exchange point services and non recurring installation fees and managed services fees 
revenues from colocation and exchange point services are billed and recognized ratably over the period of usage 
installation fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the related contract 
managed services fees are recognized in the period in which the services were provided 
revenues from real estate sales are recognized at the time of delivery to the customer 
revenues from development  commission and construction fees are recognized when earned 
revenues from construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract 
this method is used because management considers cost incurred to be the best measure of progress on these contracts 
the duration of a construction contract generally exceeds one year 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are classified as other liabilities and represent billings in excess of revenues recognized 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which losses are determined 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions can be reasonably estimated 
accordingly  it is possible that our current estimates relating to completion cost and profitability of our uncompleted contracts will vary from actual results 
accounting for income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we currently have provided for a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance and based on the available objective evidence  management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable 
should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period the determinations were made 
accounting for property and equipment 
property and equipment  net includes acquired assets and those accounted for under capital leases 
purchased assets are recorded at cost and capital leased assets are recorded at the net present value of minimum lease payments 
property and equipment are depreciated on the straight line method over their estimated remaining useful lives  which are generally five to twenty years for leasehold improvements  three years for computer software and five years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
should management determine that the actual useful lives of property and equipment placed into service are less than originally anticipated  or if any of our property and equipment was deemed to have incurred an impairment  additional depreciation or an impairment charge would be required  which would decrease net income in the period the determination was made 
conversely  should management determine that the actual useful lives of our property and equipment placed into service was greater than originally anticipated  less depreciation may be required  which would increase net income in the period the determination was made 
impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  we evaluate long lived assets and identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when these events occur  we determine if there is impairment by comparing the carrying value of the long lived asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
if an impairment is indicated  an impairment charge is provided for the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value and would decrease net income in the period determination was made 
changes in business conditions in the telecommunications industry and resulting decline in related construction projects caused us to perform an impairment analysis during the year ended march  of our goodwill acquired in the post shell acquisition 
based on this analysis  we determined that the asset  which is included in our real estate segment  was impaired by  we believe that the remaining  in post shell goodwill is recoverable through future related cash flows 
changes in business conditions in the telecommunications industry and resulting decline in related real estate leasing activities caused us to perform an impairment analysis during the year ended march  of the promote interests in tecota which we acquired in the telecom facilities management operations sale 
based on this analysis  we determined that the asset  which is included in our real estate segment  was impaired by  we believe that the remaining  in tecota promote interests is recoverable through future related cash flows 
during the three months ended september   we recorded a  impairment charge related to our colocation facility in santa clara  california  based on an option to purchase the facility granted to one of our vendors 
subsequent expiration of the option and continued decline in related colocation industry activities caused us in the quarter ended march  to change our classification for the facility to held for sale 
as a result  we recorded an additional  impairment 
these charges are included in our telecom facilities management segment  have fully impaired the related assets and include approximately  in expected carrying and selling costs 
results of operations for the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  revenue 
total revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march   reflecting our exit of the real estate development business 
data center revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the increase was attributable to our peering  colocation and managed services offered at the nap  which became operational on july the data center revenue in the prior year was derived from our peering and colocation services offered at the interim nap which became operational in december we expect data center revenues to increase in future periods as customers set up their operations in the nap of the americas 
future data center revenues will be derived from peering  colocation and managed services 
revenue from real estate sales was million for the year ended march   and was attributable to the sale of twelve condominium units 
the net revenue from the last six condominium units sold during the year ended march  is recorded as a gain on the sale of real estate held for sale 
development  commission and construction fees decreased approximately million during the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  this decrease resulted from a decrease in development  commission and construction fees earned primarily resulting from a decrease in commissions from telecom facilities management operations 
since we sold a large portion of our telecom facilities management operations in february  related leasing commissions and management fees have decreased 
contract construction revenue decreased million  from million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march  the decrease is attributable to the reduction in the number of contracts in as compared to during the year ended march   we completed two contracts and as of march   we had five construction contracts in process 
during the year ended march   we completed twelve contracts and as of march   we had seven contracts in process 
data center operations 
data center operations expenses increased million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the increase was attributable to costs associated with the operations of the nap of the americas facility which became operational in july the data center operations expense in the prior year was derived from operations of the interim nap facility  which became operational in december data center operations consist mainly of rent  operations personnel  electricity  chilled water and security services 
with the exception of electricity and chilled water  the majority of these expenses are fixed in nature 
we expect that our costs of electricity and chilled water costs will increase in the future as more customers utilize the nap of the americas 
start up costs data centers 
start up costs for the year ended march  primarily relate to the nap of the americas in miami  florida  and were approximately million as compared to million for the year ended march  start up costs in the previous year relate to the nap of the americas and the interim nap facility 
contract construction expenses 
contract construction expenses decreased million from million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march  this decrease is a result of the number of contracts in process  stage of completion and dollar amount of those projects 
we do not currently anticipate any losses on any of the individual contracts 
general and administrative expenses 
during fiscal year  our efforts included establishing internal operations to support our internet infrastructure services strategy 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million from approximately million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march  this decrease is attributable to the decrease in our investment in personnel and corporate infrastructure related to non core assets 
the significant components of these expenses include personnel  insurance  office expenses and professional fees 
in addition  during the year ended march   we implemented several cost savings initiatives  including staff reductions and an overall decrease in discretionary spending 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  for the year ended march  as compared to the previous fiscal year 
the increase is principally due to marketing the terrenap data centers including nap of the americas  partially offset by the decrease in marketing expenses associated with the sale of real estate 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march  the increase resulted primarily from the depreciation of the leasehold improvements and equipment used in the nap of the americas  which was placed in service on july  therefore  no similar expenses were recorded for the comparable period during impairment of long lived assets 
during the year ended march   in accordance with sfas no 
 we evaluated the carrying value of our leasehold improvements related to our colocation facility in santa clara and our goodwill related to post shell and our tecota promote interests 
our investment in our santa clara facility was impaired due to a decline in the technology sector and general economic conditions 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million 
we are currently attempting to sell our leasehold interest and terminate our obligation under the lease 
in addition  changes in business conditions in the telecommunications industry and resulting decline in related construction projects caused us to record an impairment to post shell s goodwill of approximately million 
furthermore  the decline in real estate leasing activities caused us to record an impairment of million to the tecota promote interests 
as a result of our agreement to sell certain telecom facilities management operations  during the year ended march   we recognized a million impairment of intangible assets relating to management contracts sold 
interest income 
interest income decreased from million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march  due to a decrease in our average cash balances invested and a decline in short term interest rates

we also sold six condominium units and recorded a net gain of million 
net loss from continuing operations 
net loss from continuing operations increased from million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march  this increase was primarily due to non cash items  which include impairment of long lived assets of approximately million  and depreciation and amortization expense of approximately million 
also contributing to the loss were interest expense of approximately million and million of expenses generated from the start up and operations of the nap of the americas 
loss from discontinued operations and loss on disposition of discontinued operations 
in march  we implemented our plan to dispose of acquired businesses whose operations reflect internet faxing  unified messaging and telephony services 
these operations were acquired earlier in the year ended march  in association with the amtec  spectrum communication  ixs 
net and asia connect acquisitions 
since the operations represent a class of customer and a major line of business  the results of these activities and estimated loss on disposal are accounted for as discontinued operations 
the loss on disposition of discontinued operations of million includes write off of approximately million in goodwill 
for the year ended march   discontinued operations had million of total revenues and a loss of million  net of million in goodwill amortization 
for the year ended march  there were no losses from discontinued operations or loss on disposition of discontinued operations 
results of operations for the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  revenue 
total revenue grew million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  data center revenue was million for the year ended march  no data center revenue was recorded for the previous comparable period 
the increase was attributable to our peering and colocation services offered at the interim nap 
we expect data center revenues to increase in future periods as customers set up their operations in the nap of the americas 
future data center revenues will be derived from peering  colocation and managed services 
revenue from real estate sales decreased million  or from million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march  revenue for the year ended march  is attributable to the sale of condominium units 
as a result of fewer units being available for sale  only twelve units were sold in the year ended march  development  commission and construction fees increased approximately million during the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  this increase resulted from increases of million in commissions from lease signings  primarily related to telecom facilities under management  million in management fees earned related to management of telecom  commercial and residential properties and million related to the sale of certain rights under agreements entered into in conjunction with a hotel development project 
since we sold a large portion of our telecom facilities management operations in february  related leasing commissions and management fees are expected to decrease in future periods 
contract construction revenue increased million  from million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march  during  we obtained third party contract construction projects as a result of our acquisition of post shell technology contractors  inc  now known as terremark technology contractors inc as of march   we had seven construction contracts in process 
data center operations 
data center operation expenses were million for the year ended march  no cost was recorded for the year ended march  the increase was attributable to costs associated with the operations of the interim nap facility which became operational in december we expect that data center operations costs will increase in the future as customers set up their operations in the nap of the americas

contract construction expenses increased million from million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march  this increase is attributable to an increase in the number of construction contracts in progress as a result of our acquisition of post shell technology contractors during the period and the percentages of completion of those projects 
we do not currently anticipate any losses on any of the individual contracts 
general and administrative expenses 
during fiscal  our efforts included the integration of our acquisitions and establishing internal operations to support our internet and telecom infrastructure services strategy 
general and administrative expenses increased by million from approximately million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march  this increase is attributable to our investment in personnel and corporate infrastructure and the related additional operating expenses resulting from the acquisitions of telecom routing exchange developers  post shell technology contractors  ixs 
net and asia connect 
although we are currently attempting to reduce expenses in activities not related to our core strategy  we expect general and administrative expenses relating to terrenap data center to continue increasing over time as we continue to expand our operations 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased million  or  for the year ended march  the decrease is principally due to the decrease of marketing expenses associated with the sale of real estate offset by the increase in marketing expenses associated with marketing the new merged company and terrenap data centers including nap of the americas

during the year ended march   our activities were directed towards the integration of our acquisitions and establishing internal operations to support internet and telecom infrastructure services 
loss from discontinued operations and loss on disposition of discontinued operations 
in march  we implemented our plan to dispose of certain acquired businesses whose operations reflect internet faxing  unified messaging and telephony services 
these operations were acquired earlier in the year ended march  in association with the amtec  spectrum communication  ixs 
net and asia connect acquisitions 
since the operations represent a class of customer and a major line of business  the results of these activities and estimated loss on disposal are accounted for as discontinued operations 
the loss on disposition of discontinued operations of million includes the write off of million in goodwill 
for the year ended march   discontinued operations had million of total revenues and a loss of million  net of million in goodwill amortization 
liquidity and capital resources cash used in continuing operations for the year ended march  was approximately million compared to cash used in operations of million for the year ended march   an increase of million

cash provided by financing activities for the year ended march  was million compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended march   an increase of million 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from million of new borrowings and issuance of convertible debt and million of construction payables relating to the nap of the americas and our colocation facility in santa clara  california partially offset by loan payments of million 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended march  resulted primarily from payments on loans of approximately million  including repayment of approximately million in debt associated with terremark centre and repayment of approximately million related to a cancelled line of credit  partly offset by million provided by the sale of our common stock 
during fiscal year  million of our liabilities  including notes  construction and other trade payables will come due 
we had a net working capital deficit of approximately million and stockholder s deficit of approximately million at march  and incurred a net loss of approximately million for the twelve months then ended 
this loss is the result of non cash items  including impairment charges of long lived assets of approximately million  and depreciation and amortization expense of approximately million  interest expense of approximately million  approximately million of expenses generated from the start up and operations of the nap of the americas  and not generating sufficient revenue during the year to support the increase in infrastructure 
during the year ended march   we met our liquidity needs primarily through obtaining additional debt financing and the issuance of equity interests 
some of our debt financing was either provided by or guaranteed by a principle executive officer 
we also successfully shut down or disposed of our remaining non core operations and implemented a series of expense reductions 
we expect that we will need an infusion of cash to fund our business operations during the next fiscal year 
our current liquidity needs are primarily related to repayment of our construction payables  other payables and debt and to support operations 
we have developed a plan to continue operating through the year ended march  actual funding requirements are dependent upon our ability to meet expectations and will be significantly impacted if some or all of the following assumptions  which underly the expectations are not met signing of additional customer contracts at nap of the americas  restructuring of million of construction payables into long term payables or equity or a combination thereof  exercise of our option to sell our common stock to a financial institution resulting in million in additional equity  no funding under any of our guarantees  and restructuring of our million credit facility  as discussed below 
we have identified additional potential customers and are actively marketing to them available services in the nap of the americas 
our plan is predicated on obtaining additional customer contracts by march   which on an annual basis will generate revenues of approximately million 
we have also been pursuing and continue to seek sources of additional debt and equity financing 
we are actively engaged in discussions with certain vendors to restructure the terms of our construction payable obligations 
our failure to obtain adequate terms from creditors and additional debt or equity financing and meet this plan will result in liquidity problems and require us to curtail  in whole or in part  current operations 
there can be no assurances that our plan will be adequately implemented in the time frame contemplated  even if such funds are obtained 
further  any additional equity financing if obtained  will be dilutive to existing stockholders 
as a result of these matters  substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our plan to increase liquidity includes additional equity funding  entering into strategic relationships  and the potential sale of additional debt securities sufficient to fund our business plan 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us 
our ability to obtain financing may be adversely affected by future declines in the technology sector and general economic conditions 
we intend to allocate our financial resources to activities that are consistent with our strategy of developing and operating terrenap data centers  including the nap of the americas 
however  the development of the nap of the americas and other terrenap data centers will require substantial capital resources 
as part of our business strategy  we intend to continue to evaluate potential acquisitions  joint ventures and strategic alliances in or with companies that provide services or operations that complement our existing businesses 
these acquisitions may also require financing  which may not be available to us on acceptable terms 
debt and equity activity in june  we entered into an exclusive agreement with the comunidad autonoma de madrid to develop and operate carrier neutral network access points naps in spain 
as part of that agreement the parties formed nap de las americas madrid sa for the purpose of owning and operating carrier neutral tier naps in spain and of which we own

risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this annual report 
our business  financial condition or operating results could be seriously harmed if any of these risks materialize 
the trading price of our common stock may also decline due to any of these risks 
the deployment of our terrenap sm data center strategy will require us to expend substantial resources for leases  improvements of facilities  purchase of complementary businesses  assets and equipment  implementation of multiple telecommunications connections and hiring of network  administrative  customer support and sales and marketing personnel 
in general  we expect that it may take us a significant period of time to select the appropriate location for a new terrenap sm data center  construct the necessary facilities  install equipment and telecommunications infrastructure and hire operations and sales personnel 
the failure to generate sufficient cash flows or to raise sufficient funds may require us to delay or abandon some or all of our development and expansion plans or otherwise forego market opportunities  making it difficult for us to generate additional revenue and to respond to competitive pressures 
expenditures commence well before a terrenap sm data center opens  and it may take an extended period for us to approach break even capacity utilization 
as a result  we expect that individual terrenap sm data centers will experience losses for more than one year from the time they are opened 
if we do not attract customers to new terrenap sm data centers in a timely manner  or at all  our business would be materially adversely affected 
growth in the number of our terrenap sm data centers is likely to increase the amount and duration of losses 
to date  we have funded our operations through private debt and equity offerings 
however  because we have not yet achieved positive cash flow from our operations  we will continue to require capital support until we are cash flow positive 
our consolidated financial statements as of fiscal year end march  have been prepared on the assumption that we will continue as a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business 
our independent auditors have issued a report dated july  stating that our recurring operating losses  negative cash flows  and liquidity deficit  combined with our current lack of credit facilities  raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
investors in our securities should review carefully our financial statements and the report of our independent accountants thereon 
our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on several factors  including our ability to raise additional debt and capital 
there can be no assurance that any financing will be available through bank borrowings  debt or equity issuances  vendor lines of credit  or otherwise  on acceptable terms or at all 
if future financing requirements are satisfied through the issuance of equity securities  investors may experience significant dilution both in terms of their percentage interest in the company and the net book value per share of common stock 
while we are actively seeking strategic solutions to our funding issues  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue as a going concern 
the nature of our operations changed subsequent to our april  merger with amtec  inc our operations continue to evolve as we develop our internet infrastructure and managed services business 
we began offering internet infrastructure and managed services in due to our short operating history  our business model is still evolving 
consequently  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operation may not be necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
we have experienced revenue growth in the recent period  but this growth may not be indicative of our future operating results 
many of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly in the future are beyond our control 
we believe that we will continue to experience net losses on a quarterly and annual basis for the foreseeable future 
we may also use significant amounts of cash and or equity to acquire complementary businesses  products  services or technologies 
the market for internet infrastructure services has only recently begun to develop  is evolving rapidly and likely will be characterized by an increasing number of market entrants 
there is significant uncertainty regarding whether this market ultimately will prove to be viable or  if it becomes viable  that it will grow 
our future growth  if any  will be dependent on the willingness of carriers to peer and colocate within our facilities  enterprises to outsource the system and network management of their mission critical internet operations and our ability to market our services in a cost effective manner to a sufficiently large number of those potential customers 
there can be no assurance that the market for our services will develop  that our services will be adopted or that businesses  organizations or consumers will use the internet for commerce and communication 
if this market fails to develop  or develops more slowly than expected  or if the our services do not achieve market acceptance  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
we intend to allocate our financial resources to activities that are consistent with our strategy of developing and operating terrenap sm data centers  including the nap of the americas 
we have therefore implemented a policy of reducing expenditures in areas that are not consistent with that objective 
however  the development of the nap of the americas and other terrenap sm data centers will require substantial capital resources 
we are exploring various alternatives  including the raising of debt and equity both in private and public markets and obtaining financing from our vendors 
in the event that we are unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient financial resources to permit us to fully implement our proposed plans  we will consider various alternatives  including possible joint ventures and reducing the scale or deferring implementation of proposed projects 
however  there is no assurance that we will have the funds necessary to discharge our obligations associated with operating the nap of the americas or developing and operating other terrenap sm data centers 
the expansion of our operations through the opening of additional terrenap sm data centers in emerging markets is part of our strategy 
to expand successfully  we must be able to assess markets  locate and secure new terrenap sm data center sites  install hardware  software and other equipment in and develop terrenap sm data center facilities  and attract carriers  internet service providers and other customers to the new locations 
to manage this expansion effectively  we must continue to improve our operational and financial systems and expand  train and manage our employee base and build a menu of managed services 
we anticipate continuing to make significant investments in the nap of the americas and new terrenap sm data centers and network infrastructure  product development  sales and marketing programs and personnel 
our inability to establish additional terrenap sm data centers or effectively manage our expansion would have a material adverse effect upon our business 
furthermore  if we were to become unable to continue leveraging third party products in our services offerings  our product development costs could increase significantly 
finally  several of our customers are emerging growth companies that may have negative cash flows  and there is the possibility that we will not be able to collect receivables on a timely basis 
we expect to continue to make additional significant investments in sales and marketing and the development of new services as part of our expansion strategy 
we will incur further expenses from sales personnel hired to test market our services in markets where there is no terrenap sm data center 
in addition  we typically experience a lengthy sales cycle for our services  particularly given the importance to customers of securing internet connectivity for mission critical operations and the need to educate certain customers regarding terrenap sm data center  and benefits of colocation and internet connectivity services 
the rate of growth in our customer base and the length of the sales cycle for our services may cause significant adverse results to our business  and our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
due to the typically lengthy sales cycle for our services  our expenses may occur prior to customer commitments for our services 
there can be no assurance that the increase in our sales and marketing efforts will result in increased sales of our services 
our success is substantially dependent on the continued growth of our customer base and the retention of our customers 
our ability to attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors  including the willingness of carriers to peer at our facilities  the willingness of businesses to outsource their mission critical internet operations  the reliability and cost effectiveness of our services and our ability to effectively market such services 
we intend to develop alternative distribution and lead generation relationships with potential channel partners 
any failure by us to develop these relationships could materially and adversely impact our ability to generate increased revenues  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on a limited number of third party suppliers for key components of our infrastructure  and the loss of one or more suppliers may slow our growth or cause us to lose customers 
for example  the flywheel electrical generators that we use for power backup at the nap of the americas and the routers used as part of our peering infrastructure  that  are available only from sole or limited sources in the quantities and quality demanded by us 
we purchase these components and technology assistance pursuant to short term agreements with our infrastructure contractors 
we do not carry inventories of components and we have no guaranteed supply or service arrangements with any of these vendors 
any failure to obtain required products or services on a timely basis  at an acceptable cost would impede the growth of our business  causing our financial condition to be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  any failure of our suppliers to provide products or components that comply with evolving internet standards  would materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we conduct business internationally 
accordingly  our future operating results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including currency exchange fluctuation  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulty in collections  and in managing operations  taxes  restrictions on repatriation of earnings  regulatory  political or economic conditions in a specific country or region  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements 
the market for internet infrastructure services is extremely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
many companies have announced that they will begin to provide or plan to expand their service offerings to compete with our services 
we expect to encounter increased competition in the future due to increased consolidation and the development of strategic alliances in the industry 
in addition  we will compete with foreign service providers as we expand internationally and as these service providers increasingly compete in the united states market 
the principal competitive factors in our market include ability to deliver services when requested by the customer  internet system engineering and other professional services expertise  customer service  network capability  reliability  quality of service and scalability  variety of managed services offered  access to network resources  including circuits  equipment and interconnection capacity to other networks  broad geographic presence  price  ability to maintain and expand distribution channels  brand name recognition  timing of introductions of new services  physical and network security  financial resources  and customer base our current and potential competitors include providers of data center services  global  regional and local telecommunications companies and regional bell operating companies  and information technology outsourcing firms 
some of our competitors  particularly the global telecommunications companies that have begun  or intend to begin  providing data center services  have substantially greater resources  more customers  longer operating histories  greater name recognition  and may have more established relationships in the industry than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be able to develop and expand their internet infrastructure services faster  devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can 
in addition  these competitors have entered and will likely continue to enter into business relationships to provide additional services that compete with the services we provide 
we believe our market is likely to consolidate in the near future  which could result in increased price and other competition 
some of our competitors may be able to provide customers with additional benefits relating to the customer s internet system and network management solutions  including reduced local and long distance communications costs  which could reduce the overall costs of their services relative to ours 
we may not be able to offset the effects of any price reductions 
as we expand our operations in markets outside the united states  we will also encounter new competitors and competitive environments 
our foreign competitors may enjoy a government sponsored monopoly on telecommunications services essential to our business  and will generally have a better understanding of their local industry and longer working relationships with local infrastructure providers 
we believe that we have certain competitive advantages but there are few barriers to entry 
we are recognized by industry members as one of five owners operators of tier nap in the us 
none of the other four tier naps offer class a space immediately adjacent to the peering point as well as managed services 
in addition  we are the only carrier neutral nap 
nevertheless  there are few substantial barriers to entry to the colocation and managed services market  and we expect to face additional competition from existing competitors and new market entrants in the future 
we are dependent on key personnel 
we are highly dependent on the services of manuel d 
medina  our chairman 
the loss of mr 
medina could materially harm our business 
our potential growth and expansion and the merger and integration of separate businesses  are expected to place increased demands on our management skills and resources 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain and attract skilled and experienced management 
the failure to attract and retain personnel could materially harm our business and impair the price of our stock 
if our shares are delisted from the american stock exchange  we may apply to have our shares quoted on nasdaq s bulletin board or in the pink sheets maintained by the national quotation bureau  inc the bulletin board and the pink sheets are generally considered to be less efficient markets than the american stock exchange on which the shares are currently traded 
in addition  if our shares are no longer listed on the american stock exchange or another national securities exchange in the united states  our shares may be subject to the penny stock regulations 
if our shares are delisted from the american stock exchange  our stockholders could find it difficult to sell our stock and the price of our stock could be adversely affected 
you should not expect to receive dividends on our common stock 
we have not paid dividends on our common stock to date and have no plans for paying dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future 
we have certain obligations to pay dividends in kind  which may be paid  at our option  in common stock to holders of the series g and series h preferred shares 
except for those dividends on the shares of issued and outstanding preferred stock  and cash or in kind dividends that we may pay on other preferred stock that may be issued in the future that require dividends  we intend to retain any earnings to pay for the expansion of our business 
in addition  covenants in our financing agreements prohibit the payment of dividends 
we could pay additional taxes because our operations are subject to various foreign taxes 
we structure our operations based on assumptions about various tax laws  us and international tax treaty developments  international currency exchange and capital repatriation laws and other relevant laws of a variety of non us jurisdictions 
taxing or other authorities might not reach the same conclusions we reach 
we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if our assumptions about these matters are incorrect or the relevant laws are changed or modified 
distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries and affiliates may be subject to foreign taxes  reducing our earnings 
distributions of earnings and other payments  including interest  we receive from our subsidiaries and affiliates may be subject to withholding taxes imposed by the jurisdictions in which these entities are formed or operating 
these taxes would reduce the amount of after tax cash we would receive from these entities 
our customer service could suffer if we are unable to obtain satisfactory services from local communications providers  which could adversely affect our ability to compete 
we depend on local carriers to provide various communications services to us and to our customers 
we have from time to time had delays in receiving these communications services 
we may not be able to obtain these services on the scale and within the time required by us at an affordable cost  or at all 
if adequate services are not provided  customer service could suffer as could our competitive position and financial results 
further these service providers could become competitors in the future 
recent terrorist activity in the united states and the military action to counter terrorism could adversely impact our business 
the september  terrorist attacks in the united states  the ensuing declaration of war on terrorism and the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility appear to be having an adverse effect on business  financial and general economic conditions in the us these effects may  in turn  result in increased costs due to the need to provide enhanced security  which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
these circumstances may also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers  our ability to raise capital and the operation and maintenance of our nap facilities 
our business could be harmed by prolonged electrical power outages or shortages  or increased costs of energy 
our nap facilities are susceptible to regional costs of power  electrical power shortages and planned or unplanned power outages caused by these shortages 
a power shortage may result in an increase of the cost of energy  which we may not be able to pass on to our customers 
we attempt to limit exposure to system downtime by using backup generators and power supplies 
power outages  which last beyond our backup and alternative power arrangements  could harm our customers and our business 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board approved statement of financial accounting standards no 
fasb  business combinations  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
fasb  goodwill and other intangible assets 
fasb requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  fasb changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
the provisions of fas are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt fas at the beginning of the fiscal year ending march  in august  the financial accounting standards board approved statement of financial accounting standards no 
fasb  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
fasb supercedes fasb  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of business 
fasb retains the requirements of fasb for recognition and measurement of an impairment loss on long lived assets  and establishes a single accounting model for all long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
the provisions of fas are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt fas at the beginning of the fiscal year ending march  we do not expect the adoption of fasb  fasb or fasb to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements assuming we are a going concern 
had we continued amortizing our intangible assets  the annual amortization expense would have been approximately million for the next four years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not entered into any financial instruments for trading or hedging purposes 
our carrying values of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses is a reasonable approximation of their fair value 
our exposure to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt 
an immediate increase or decrease in current interest rates would furthermore not have a material impact to our debt obligations due to the fixed nature of our debt obligations 
the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
these interest rate changes may affect the fair market value of the fixed interest rate debt but does not impact our earnings or cash flows 
to date  all of our recognized revenue has been denominated in us dollars  generated mostly from customers in the us  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations has been minimal 
we expect that future revenues may be derived from customers outside of the us and may be denominated in foreign currency 
as a result  our operating results or cash flows may be impacted due to currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar 
furthermore  to the extent we engage in international sales that are denominated in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our services less competitive in the international markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we cannot assure you that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
some of our operating costs are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices 
the commodity most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of significant price change is electricity 
we are closely monitoring the cost of electricity 
to the extent that electricity costs continue to rise  we are investigating opportunities to pass these additional power costs onto our customers that utilize this power 
we do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge commodity price risk
