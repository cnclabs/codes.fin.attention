item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a more complete understanding of our financial condition and results of operations  and some of the risks that could affect future results  see risk factors beginning on page this section should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  which immediately follow this section 
critical accounting policies and estimates trimble s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  doubtful accounts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring costs  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the amount and timing of revenue and expenses and the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition trimble s revenues are recorded in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we require the following i execution of a written customer order  ii delivery of the product  iii fee is fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility of the proceeds is probable 
we recognize revenue from product sales when the products are shipped to the customer  title has transferred  and no significant obligations remain 
the company defers revenue if there is uncertainty about customer acceptance 
the company reduces product revenue for estimated customer returns and for any discounts that may occur under programs the company has with its customers and partners 
our shipment terms for domestic orders are typically fob shipping point 
our international orders are typically shipped fob destination  and accordingly  international orders are not recognized as revenue until the product is delivered and title has transferred 
revenues from purchased extended warranty and support agreements are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the warranty support period 
substantially all technology licenses and research revenue have consisted of initial license fees and royalties  which were recognized when earned  provided trimble had no remaining obligations 
sales to distributors and resellers are recognized upon shipment providing that there is evidence of such an arrangement through a distribution agreement or purchase order  title has transferred  no remaining performance obligations exist  the price and terms of the sale are fixed and collection is probable 
distributors and resellers do not have a right of return 
the company s software arrangements consist of a license fee and post contract customer support pcs 
the company has established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for its pcs contracts based on the price of the renewal rate 
the remaining value of the software arrangement is allocated to license fee using the residual method  which revenue is primarily recognized when the software has been delivered and there are no remaining obligations 
revenue from pcs is recognized ratably over the period of the pcs agreement 
allowance for doubtful accounts trimble maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market 
we use a standard cost accounting system to value inventory and these standards are reviewed a minimum of once a year and multiple times a year in our most active manufacturing plants 
we adjust the inventory value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory  based on management s assessment of future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill and other purchased intangible assets trimble has significant tangible and intangible assets on its balance sheet that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles related to acquisitions 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful amortization lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates 
the testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions 
trimble s assets are tested and reviewed for impairment on an ongoing basis under the established accounting guidelines 
changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to asset valuations 
if facts and circumstances indicate that the goodwill  other intangible assets or property and equipment may be impaired  an evaluation of continuing value would be performed 
if an evaluation is required  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets would be compared to their carrying amount to determine if a write down to fair market value or discounted cash flow value is required 
warranties we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be required 
business developments on march   trimble and caterpillar inc announced that they have reached a definitive agreement to form caterpillar trimble control technologies llc 
the joint venture  percent owned by trimble and percent owned by caterpillar  will develop the next generation of advanced electronic guidance and control products for earthmoving machines in the construction  mining and waste industries 
caterpillar trimble control technologies llc will be based in dayton  ohio and is expected to begin operations on april  under the terms of the agreement  caterpillar contributed million cash and selected technology  and trimble contributed select existing machine control product technologies valued at million 
additionally  both companies have licensed patents and other intellectual property from their portfolios to the joint venture 
also  trimble has received a special cash distribution of million from the joint venture 
the joint venture s intention is to develop machine control products that integrate site design information with accurate positioning technology to automatically control blades and other machine functions this machine control technology will combine historical trimble positioning technology with capability gained through the acquisition of spectra precision 
effective as of april   trimble completed the acquisition of certain assets of grid data  inc grid data  an arizona corporation  for approximately million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities 
in addition  trimble may make certain earn out payments based upon the completion of certain business milestones 
if the first milestone is achieved by april    shares of trimble common stock will be paid out to the shareholders of grid data 
if the first milestone is achieved and a second milestone is completed by october   an additional  shares of trimble common stock will be paid out 
however  if at the time the second milestone is achieved trimble s common stock is at a price less than the price per share as defined in the agreement  then trimble may  at its option  pay million in cash or million in trimble common stock  valued on the date that the second milestone is achieved 
the additional consideration  if earned  will be recorded as additional goodwill 
at the date of this report  it was uncertain whether the first milestone will be achieved by april  on march   trimble sold certain product lines of its air transport systems business  to honeywell international inc for approximately million in cash 
the air transport system business was not material to the company s financial results and was not considered strategic to trimble s future operations 
under the asset purchase agreement  honeywell purchased the air transport systems product lines that included the ht  ht  ht and trimble s tnl as part of an alliance that began in  trimble and honeywell jointly developed  manufactured  marketed  and sold the ht product line 
these products are installed in many commercial aircraft and major airlines around the world for gps based navigation 
during the third quarter of fiscal trimble also sold off other related product lines and discontinued its manufacturing operations in austin  texas 
these actions resulted in a loss on disposal of approximately  which is included in nonoperating income expense for fiscal the company also incurred severance costs of approximately  which is included in restructuring charges related to the termination of employees associated with the product lines disposed of in fiscal trimble acquired the spectra precision group on july   which resulted in trimble s emergence as the leader in the engineering and construction market 
an integration team was immediately created to manage the transition  reduce risks  and achieve approximately million of annualized cost synergies 
management believes the integration efforts have proceeded in accordance with the plans 
the sales force has been integrated  the global distribution channel has been extended  the survey and machine guidance product lines have been rationalized  redundant development has been eliminated and redundant sales and service facilities have been consolidated 
overall  these actions have resulted in approximately million of annualized cost synergies implemented by the end of fiscal we expect these cost synergies to primarily benefit our sales and marketing expenses  but operational efficiencies will also reduce our administrative expenses  and costs of goods sold with the elimination of duplicate product lines  and consolidation of purchasing and manufacturing operations 
we have realized to date approximately million of these cost reductions  primarily in sales and marketing expenses  and expect to realize the balance in fiscal the remaining savings are expected to benefit our sales and marketing expenses  as well as favorably impact our gross margins through increased manufacturing efficiencies 

additional cost reduction activities are planned for fiscal such as further consolidation of sales and service facilities primarily in europe  which are expected to enable us to meet the original million estimate in cost synergies

portfolio technologies revenues this segment is an aggregation of various operations that each equal less than ten percent of the company s total operating revenue 
the products in this segment are navigation modules and embedded sensors that are used in avionics  flight  and military applications 
also  included in this segment are the operations of our tripod data systems subsidiary which was acquired on november  portfolio technologies revenues increased by million or in fiscal over fiscal the revenue increase compared to was due to the following factors o in fiscal  trimble experienced a full year of revenues generated from the purchase of tripod data systems as compared to one and one half months in fiscal  which accounted for an increase of approximately million 
o the above increase was partially offset by a million or reduction in our commercial aviation product line during fiscal the sale of the air transport product line to honeywell was completed in march see note to the consolidated financial statements 
portfolio technologies revenues decreased by million or in fiscal over fiscal the revenue decrease compared to was due to the following o decreases in revenues for military and air transport products

international revenues 
sales to our unaffiliated customers in locations outside the us comprised approximately of total revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal north and south america represented of total revenue  europe  and asia in fiscal we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue 
for this reason  we are subject to the risks inherent in these foreign sales  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  exchange rates  governmental approval  and tariffs or other barriers 
even though the us government announced on march   that it would support and maintain the gps system  and on may   stated that it has no intent to ever again use selective availability sa  a method of degrading gps accuracy  there may be reluctance in certain foreign markets to purchase such products given the control of gps by the us government 
trimble s results of operations could be adversely affected if we were unable to continue to generate significant sales in locations outside the us no single customer  including the us government and its agencies  accounted for or more of the company s total revenues in fiscal  or it is possible  however  that in future periods the failure of one or more large customers to purchase products in quantities anticipated by the company may adversely affect the results of operations 
gross margin 
gross margin varies due to a number of factors  including product mix  international sales mix  customer type  the effects of production volumes and fixed manufacturing costs on unit product costs  and new product start up costs 
gross margin as a percentage of total revenues was in fiscal and in fiscal not including a million charge for inventory purchase accounting adjustment for the acquisition of the spectra precision group  gross margin was in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in gross margin percentage for fiscal  compared with fiscal  is due largely to approximately million of charges associated with the write down of excess and obsolete inventory partially related to the consolidation and simplification of product lines  and partially due to components in excess of our demand forecast horizon of twelve months  which impacted gross margin by approximately 
we expect that these excess and obsolete products will be disposed of during fiscal these disposals may result from selling at deeply discounted prices  use in research and development  or scrap 
also during fiscal  we exited a number of our direct sales offices  in an ongoing effort to change our sales model from direct to dealer discount  which impacted gross margin by approximately 
the remaining decrease in gross margin percentage is attributable to product mix changes and a full year sale of spectra precision group s products as compared to half a year in fiscal  which typically are sold at lower gross margins than trimble s traditional products 
in addition  there were unabsorbed fixed manufacturing overheads due to lower than expected revenues in fiscal  resulting from the economic slowdown 
in fiscal  adjusted gross margin increased by one percentage point over fiscal year due to the favorable product mix of engineering and construction and agriculture products  which yielded higher margins through the integration of software and wireless communications 
in addition  it was favorably impacted by the cost benefits of outsourcing our manufacturing to solectron 
these increases were partially offset by higher costs to acquire components due to worldwide component shortages 
because of potential product mix changes within and among the industry markets  market pressures on unit selling prices  fluctuations in unit manufacturing costs  including increases in component prices and other factors  current level gross margins cannot be assured 
in addition  should the global economic conditions deteriorate further  gross margin could be further adversely impacted

o trimble also had decreases of approximately million in expenses related to personnel  legal  facilities  equipment and other office supplies 
o these decreases were partially offset by approximately million of the spectra precision group s expenses included since its purchase in july restructuring charges restructuring charges of million were recorded in fiscal  which related to severance costs incurred as a result of the company being impacted by the global economic slow down  as well as severance costs related to employees terminated due to the disposition of certain product lines 
as a result of these actions  trimble s headcount decreased in fiscal by individuals 
this headcount reduction will reduce our on going operating expenses and enable us to be better positioned to achieve our strategic goals 
as of december   all of the restructuring charges except for approximately  have been paid 
the remaining amounts are expected to be paid in fiscal spectra precision group restructuring activities at the time we acquired the spectra precision group  we formulated a restructuring plan and provided approximately million for costs to close certain duplicative office facilities  combine operations including redundant domestic and foreign legal entities  reduce workforce in overlapping areas  and relocate certain employees 
these costs were accrued for as part of the allocation of the purchase price 
included in the total cost was approximately million related to the discontinuance of overlapping product lines which was included in our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
the facility consolidation and employee relocations resulted primarily from combining certain office facilities and duplicative functions  including management functions  of the spectra precision group 
through the end of fiscal  we had charged against the reserve approximately million which consisted of million for legal and tax consulting expenses relating to consolidation of legal entities  million for severance expenses  million for facilities and direct sales offices closures  million for an underfunded pension plan  and other costs of million 
we revised our final estimates of the costs to complete the remaining planned activities and accordingly reduced the restructuring reserve by approximately million  with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal the reserve balance was approximately million at december  and we anticipate completing the majority of our restructuring activities during fiscal the elements of the reserve at december  on the balance sheet included in accrued liabilities are as follows employee severance and facility closure  legal relocation and tax expense total in thousands total reserve    amounts paid written off    revision to estimates  balance as of december    amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles

nonoperating income expense  net increased by million during fiscal as compared with fiscal the primary reason for the increase was an increase in interest expenses related to loans and credit facilities resulting from the acquisition of the spectra precision group of approximately million income tax provision 
trimble s effective income tax rates from continuing operations for fiscal years  and were  and  respectively 
the income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of  due primarily to foreign taxes and the inability to realize the benefit of net operating losses 
the and income tax rates are less than the federal statutory rate  due primarily to the realization of the benefits from prior net operating losses and previously reserved deferred tax assets 
inflation

this was financed by the issuance of common stock of approximately million  and cash generated from operating activities of approximately million 
the company also used approximately million for the purchase of certain assets of grid data  and approximately million for net capital expenditures 
at december   trimble s debt mainly consisted of million outstanding under senior secured credit facilities  and an million subordinated promissory note related to the acquisition of the spectra precision group 
trimble has relied primarily on cash provided by operating activities to fund capital expenditures  and other investing activities 
during december and january  the company raised million and million  respectively  in a private placement of equity 
on march   the company used million of net proceeds from its private placement to retire accrued interest and principal under its subordinated note with spectra physics holdings  inc  a subsidiary of thermo electron  reducing the outstanding principal amount to million 
in addition  the company renegotiated the terms of the subordinated note 
under the revised agreement  the maturity of the note was extended until july   at the current interest rate of approximately per year 
in connection with the amendment  on march   the company agreed to issue to thermo electron a five year warrant to purchase  shares of trimble s common stock at an exercise price of 
under the terms of the agreement  beginning on july   trimble will also issue five year warrants to purchase shares of common stock on a quarterly basis for every million of principal and interest outstanding until the note is paid off 
these warrants will be exercisable at a price equal to trimble s closing price on the last trading day of each quarter 
under the five year warrant  the total number of warrants issued will not exceed  shares 
in fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was million  as compared to million in fiscal trimble s ability to continue to generate cash from operations will depend in large part on revenues  the rate of collections of accounts receivable  and continued focus on reducing operating costs and the move towards profitability 
both the inventory turns and accounts receivable days sales outstanding metrics were similar at the end of fiscal to the fiscal level 
the decrease in inventory turns from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to the acquisition of the spectra precision group in july  we moved from an outsource model in to significant in house manufacturing in fiscal as a result of the factories acquired in the usa  sweden and germany 
also  the increase in accounts receivable days sales outstanding from fiscal to fiscal was due to the spectra precision group conducting a significant portion of its business with international customers  who are traditionally slower payers 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal cash used in investing activities in fiscal was primarily related to the purchase of the spectra precision group  offset by net sales of short term investments 
cash used by financing activities was million in fiscal as compared with cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal during fiscal  the company made million of payments against its senior secured credit facilities 
these payments were offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock to employees pursuant to trimble s stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan of million  as well as issuance of common stock under a private equity placement of million

if trimble is able to achieve and maintain a leverage ratio debt ebitda of x or less for four consecutive quarters  the security for the credit facilities will be released 
financial covenants of the credit facilities include leverage  fixed charge  and minimum net worth tests 
during december  the company received a waiver with respect to compliance with the fixed charge ratio for the quarter ended december   and modified the fixed charge ratio for the quarter ended march  at december   the company is in compliance with debt covenants 
the amounts due under the three year revolver loans are paid as the loans mature  and the loan commitment fees are paid on a quarterly basis 
under the five year term loan  the company is due to make payments excluding interest of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and the remaining million in fiscal in order to reduce variable interest rate exposure on borrowings under its existing credit facility  trimble had an interest rate swap agreement on a portion of the variable rate debt  which fixes the rate on the notional amount of million at

management believes that its cash and cash equivalents  together with its credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet its anticipated operating cash needs beyond the next twelve months 
at december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents  as well as access to million of cash under the terms of its three year revolver loans 
on january   we completed the second closing of the private placement equity offering  through which  we received aggregate cash proceeds of approximately million 
these proceeds were used to repay debt 
trimble is currently restricted from paying dividends and is limited as to the amount of its common stock that it can repurchase under the terms of the credit facilities 
the company is allowed to pay dividends and repurchase shares of its common stock up to of net income in the previous fiscal year 
the company has obligations under noncancelable operating leases for its office facilities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  the payments under these noncancelable operating leases are expected to be approximately million 
the company expects fiscal capital expenditures to be approximately million to million  primarily for computer equipment  software  and leasehold improvements associated with business expansion 
decisions related to how much cash is used for investing are influenced by the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations 
trimble has evaluated the issues and does not currently believe that the introduction of the euro for widespread business use in january will have a material effect on its foreign exchange and hedging activities 
trimble has also assessed the potential impact that the euro conversion will have in regard to its internal systems accommodating euro denominated transactions and does not currently anticipate any adverse impact to the company 
trimble has entered into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the effects of changes in exchange rates on foreign denominated intercompany receivables 
at december   we had forward foreign currency exchange contracts to sell approximately million japanese yen  approximately million euros  and to buy approximately million british pounds sterling at contracted rates that mature over the next six months 
certain other risk factors our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate 
our operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
results in any period could be affected by changes in market demand  competitive market conditions  market acceptance of new or existing products  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the cost and availability of components  our ability to manufacture and ship products  the mix of our customer base and sales channels  the mix of products sold  our ability to expand our sales and marketing organization effectively  our ability to attract and retain key technical and managerial employees  the timing of shipments of products under contracts and sale of licensing rights  and general global economic conditions 
in addition  demand for our products in any quarter or year may vary due to the seasonal buying patterns of our customers in the agricultural and engineering and construction industries 
due to the foregoing factors  our operating results in one or more future periods are expected to be subject to significant fluctuations 
the price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which are based primarily on historical models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 
our operating results in each quarter may not accurately reflect business activity in each quarter 
due  in part  to the buying patterns of our customers  a significant portion of our quarterly revenues occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter  although our operating expenses tend to remain constant 
if for any reason expected sales are deferred  orders are not received  or shipments were to be delayed a few days at the end of a quarter  our operating results and reported earnings per share for that quarter could be significantly impacted 
our gross margin is subject to fluctuation 
our gross margin is affected by a number of factors  including product mix  product pricing  cost of components  foreign currency exchange rates and manufacturing costs 
for example  since our engineering and construction and geographic information systems gis products generally have higher gross margins than our component technologies products  absent other factors  a shift in sales toward engineering and construction and gis products would lead to a gross margin improvement 
on the other hand  if market conditions in the highly competitive engineering and construction and gis market segments forced us to lower unit prices  we would suffer a decline in gross margin unless we were able to timely offset the price reduction by a reduction in production costs or by sales of other products with higher gross margins 
a decline in gross margin could have a material effect on our operating results 
we are dependent on a sole manufacturer for our products and on sole suppliers of critical parts for our products 
with the selection of solectron corporation in august as an exclusive manufacturing partner for many of our gps products previously manufactured out of our sunnyvale facilities  we are substantially dependent upon a sole supplier for the manufacture of our products 
under the agreement with solectron  we provide to solectron a twelve month product forecast and place purchase orders with solectron sixty calendar days in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to our customers 
although purchase orders placed with solectron are cancelable  the terms of the agreement would require us to purchase from solectron all material inventory not returnable or usable by other solectron customers 
accordingly  if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products  we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from solectron to meet customers delivery requirements or we may accumulate excess inventories  if such inventories are not usable by other solectron customers 
in addition  we rely on sole suppliers for a number of our critical asics 
we have experienced shortages of supplies  including asics  in the past 
as an example  we were affected by industry wide shortages of memory devices and electronic components that reached their most severe impact in the third calendar quarter of our current reliance on sole or a limited group of suppliers involves several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and reduced control over pricing 
any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products  which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our credit agreement contains stringent financial covenants 
two of the financial covenants in our credit agreement with abn amro bank  nv and certain other banks  dated as of july  as amended the credit agreement  minimum fixed charge coverage and maximum leverage ratio  are extremely sensitive to changes in earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
in turn  ebitda is highly correlated to revenues and cost cutting 
due to uncertainties associated with the downturn in the worldwide economy  our future revenues by quarter are becoming increasingly more difficult to forecast and we have recently put in place various cost cutting measures  including the consolidation of service functions and centers  closure of redundant offices  consolidation of redundant product lines and reductions in staff 
if revenues should decline at a faster pace than the rate of these cost cutting measures  on a quarter to quarter basis we may not be in compliance with the two above mentioned financial covenants 
if we default on one or more covenants  we will have to obtain either negotiated waivers or amendments to the credit agreement 
if we are unable to obtain such waivers or amendments  the banks would have the right to accelerate the payment of our outstanding obligations under the credit agreement  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and viability as an operating company 
in addition  a default under one of our debt instruments may also trigger cross defaults under our other debt instruments 
an event of default under any debt instrument  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
our substantial indebtedness could materially restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition 
we now have  and for the foreseeable future will have  a significant level of indebtedness 
our substantial indebtedness could o increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  o limit our ability to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  research and development and other general corporate requirements  or to make certain investments that could benefit us  o require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service interest and principal payments on our debt  o limit our flexibility to react to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and o limit our ability to borrow additional funds 
we face competition in our markets 
our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future 
our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price  quality and performance of our products  the level of customer service  the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets 
within each of our markets  we encounter direct competition from other gps  optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger domestic and international competitors and new market entrants  some of which may be our current customers 
the competition in the future  may  in some cases  result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide systems and products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement this strategy successfully  or that any such products will be competitive with other technologies or products that may be developed by our competitors  many of whom have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  sales and other resources than we do 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures cause us to lose market share or force us to engage in price reductions that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may encounter problems associated with international operations and sales 
our customers are located throughout the world 
sales to unaffiliated customers in foreign locations represented approximately of our revenues in our fiscal year and in each of our fiscal years and in addition  we have significant international operations  including manufacturing facilities  sales personnel and customer support operations 
our international sales operations include offices in australia  canada  china  france  germany  great britain  japan  mexico  new zealand  sweden  russia  singapore and others 
our international manufacturing facilities are in sweden and germany 
our international presence exposes us to risks not faced by wholly domestic companies 
specifically  we have experienced issues relating to integration of foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  longer payment cycles and currency fluctuations 
additionally  we face the following risks  among others unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  political  legal and economic instability in foreign markets  particularly in those markets in which we maintain manufacturing and research facilities  difficulties in staffing and management  language and cultural barriers  seasonal reductions in business activities in the summer months in europe and some other countries  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
although we implemented a program to attempt to manage foreign exchange risks through hedging and other strategies  there can be no assurance that this program will be successful and that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  in certain foreign markets  there may be reluctance to purchase products based on gps technology  given the control of gps by the us government 
we are dependent on proprietary technology 
our future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology  and we rely on patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property 
there can be no assurance that the patents owned or licensed by us will not be invalidated  circumvented  challenged  or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
we are currently defending two separate lawsuits for alleged patent infringement  one alleging infringement of a patent by some of our grade control systems and another alleging infringement by our surveying products 
in the event that in either or both of these suits our products are held to be infringing a valid patent  we could be prevented from continuing to sell these products and could be required to pay substantial damages  or  alternatively  enter into a royalty bearing license agreement 
there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by us 
in addition  effective copyright  patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable  limited or not applied for in certain foreign countries 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our technology will prevent the misappropriation of such technology 
the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings 
we recognize that as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents  it may be necessary for us to withdraw products from the market  take a license from such patent holders  or redesign our products 
we do not believe any of our products currently infringe patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  but we cannot be certain they do not do so 
in addition  the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations 
such events could have a material adverse effect on our revenues or profitability 
we are dependent on new products 
our future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products to market on a timely basis 
we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products  enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance of such products 
however  there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or  if developed  will achieve significant customer acceptance 
if we were unable to successfully define  develop and introduce competitive new products  and enhance existing products  our future results of operations would be adversely affected 
development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict  and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products 
the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success 
in some of our markets where we currently have a market leadership position  a delay in new product introductions could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
no assurance can be given that we will not incur problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products 
our stock price may be volatile 
our common stock has experienced and can be expected to experience substantial price volatility in response to actual or anticipated quarterly variations in results of operations  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  developments related to patents or other intellectual property rights  developments in our relationship with customers  suppliers  or strategic partners and other events or factors 
in addition  any shortfall or changes in revenue  gross margins  earnings  or other financial results from analysts expectations could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
additionally  certain macro economic factors such as changes in interest rates as well as market climate for the high technology sector could also have an impact on the trading price of our stock 
we face risks of entering into and maintaining alliances 
we believe that in certain emerging markets our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain alliances with established system providers and industry leaders 
our failure to form and maintain such alliances  or the preemption of such alliances by actions of other competitors or us will adversely affect our ability to penetrate emerging markets 
no assurances can be given that we will not experience problems from current or future alliances or that we will realize value from any such strategic alliances 
we face risks in investing in and integrating new acquisitions 
we are continuously evaluating external investments in technologies related to our business  and have made relatively small strategic equity investments in a number of gps related technology companies 
acquisitions of companies  divisions of companies  or products entail numerous risks  including i the potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize cost savings or other anticipated benefits from integration  ii diversion of management s attention  iii loss of key employees of acquired operations  and iv inability to recover strategic investments in development stage entities 
any such problems could harm our growth strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
we are dependent on key customers 
we currently enjoy strong relationships with key customers 
an increasing amount of our revenue is generated from large original equipment manufacturers such as siemens vdo automotive  nortel  caterpillar  cnh global  bosch  and others 
a reduction or loss of business with these customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to realize value from these relationships in the future 
we are dependent on retaining and attracting highly skilled development and managerial personnel 
our ability to maintain our competitive technological position will depend  in a large part  on our ability to attract  motivate  and retain highly qualified development and managerial personnel 
competition for qualified employees in our industry and location is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract  motivate and retain enough qualified employees necessary for the future continued development of our business and products 
we are subject to the impact of governmental and other similar certifications 
we market certain products that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold 
for example  ce certification for radiated emissions is required for most gps receiver and data communications products sold in the european union 
an inability to obtain such certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
also  our products that use integrated radio communication technology require an end user to obtain licensing from the federal communications commission fcc for frequency band usage 
during the fourth quarter of  the fcc temporarily suspended the issuance of licenses for certain of our real time kinematic products because of interference with certain other users of similar radio frequencies 
an inability or delay in obtaining such certifications or delays of the fcc could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market  which could harm our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are dependent on the availability of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum 
our gps technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service sps provided by the us government s global positioning system gps 
the gps sps operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services 
international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu  a specialized technical agency of the united nations 
these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two three years by the world radiocommunication conference 
any itu reallocation of radio frequency bands  including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum  may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products  which would  in turn  cause a material adverse effect on our operating results 
many of our products use other radio frequency bands  together with the gps signal  to provide enhanced gps capabilities  such as real time kinematic precision 
the continuing availability of these non gps radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced gps products to our precision survey markets 
any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products  which would  in turn  cause a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  unwanted emissions from mobile satellite services and other equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or inband from licensed and unlicensed devices may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products  which could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results 
the fcc continually receives proposals for novel technologies and services  such as ultra wideband technologies  which may seek to operate in  or across  the radio frequency bands currently used by the gps sps and other public safety services 
adverse decisions by the fcc that result in harmful interference to the delivery of the gps sps and other radio frequency spectrum also used in our products may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products  which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
we are subject to the adverse impact of radio frequency congestion 
we have certain real time kinematic products  such as our land survey  that use integrated radio communication technology that requires access to available radio frequencies allocated by the fcc 
in addition  access to these frequencies by state agencies is under management by state radio communications coordinators 
some bands are experiencing congestion that excludes their availability for access by state agencies in some states  including the state of california 
an inability to obtain access to these radio frequencies could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
we are reliant on the gps satellite network 
the gps satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage 
the satellites were originally designed to have lives of years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate 
however  of the current deployment of satellites in place  some have already been in place for years 
to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible 
if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable  there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites 
a reduction in the number of operating satellites would impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the us government will remain committed to the operation and maintenance of gps satellites over a long period  or that the policies of the us government for the use of gps without charge will remain unchanged 
however  a presidential decision directive marks the first time in the evolution of gps that access for civilian use free of direct user fees is specifically recognized and supported by presidential policy 
in addition  presidential policy has been complemented by corresponding legislation  signed into law 
because of ever increasing commercial applications of gps  other us government agencies may become involved in the administration or the regulation of the use of gps signals 
any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select gps based systems instead of products based on competing technologies 
any resulting change in market demand for gps products could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
for example  european governments have expressed interest in building an independent satellite navigation system  known as galileo 
depending on the as yet undetermined design and operation of this system  there may be interference to the delivery of the gps sps and may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products  which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we are reliant on a continuous power supply 
california recently experienced an energy crisis that threatened to disrupt our operations and resulted in increased expenses for our california facilities 
in the event of an acute power shortage  that is  when power reserves for the state of california fall below certain critical levels  california has on some occasions implemented  and may in the future continue to implement  rolling blackouts throughout the state 
we currently do not have adequate backup generators or alternate sources of power in the event of a blackout  and our current insurance does not provide coverage for any damages we or our customers may suffer as a result of any interruption in our power supply 
if blackouts interrupt our power supply or solectron s power supply  we would be temporarily unable to continue operations at our california facilities 
any such interruption in our ability to continue operations at our facilities or solectron s ability to manufacture product at its facilities could damage our reputation  harm our ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new customers  and could result in lost revenue  any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
we must carefully manage our future growth 
any continued growth in our sales or any continued expansion in the scope of our operations could strain our current management  financial  manufacturing and other resources and may require us to implement and improve a variety of operating  financial and other systems  procedures and controls 
specifically we have experienced strain in our financial and order management system  as a result of our acquisitions 
while we plan to expand our sales  accounting  manufacturing  and other information systems to meet these challenges  there can be no assurance that these efforts will succeed  or that any existing or new systems over time  procedures or controls will be adequate to support our operations or that our systems  procedures and controls will be designed  implemented or improved in a cost effective and timely manner 
any failure to implement  improve and expand such systems  procedures and controls in a timely and efficient manner could harm our growth strategy and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to achieve our business objectives 
new accounting standards in august  the financial accounting standards board issued fas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
fas no 
supercedes fas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
fas no 
also amends accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary 
the provisions of fas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the effect of adopting fas no 
has been evaluated by the company  and does not have a material adverse effect on trimble s financial position or results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  statement also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business combinations completed after june  statement prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
statement requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
additionally  statement requires that goodwill included in the carrying value of equity method investments no longer be amortized 
the company will apply statement beginning in the first quarter of application of the nonamortization provisions of statement will significantly reduce amortization expense which was approximately million in fiscal the company will reclassify identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives  as defined by statement  to goodwill at the date of adoption 
the company will test goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in statement the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
the company expects to perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  in the first quarter of any impairment charge resulting from these transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of based on the preliminary unaudited analysis completed to date  we do not believe that the application of these statements will have an adverse material impact on the earnings and financial position of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
trimble uses certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
trimble does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
all financial instruments are used in accordance with polices approved by trimble s board of directors 
market interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under its senior secured credit facilities 
the company s credit facilities are comprised of a three year us dollar only revolver  a three year multi currency revolver  and a five year term loan 
borrowings under the credit facility have interest payments based on a floating rate of libor plus a number of basis points tied to a formula based on the company s leverage ratio 
as of december   our senior debt to ebitda senior leverage ratio was approximately 
at this leverage ratio our pricing will be libor plus basis points 
the us dollar and the multi currency revolvers run through july and have outstanding principal balances at december  of million and million  respectively 
as of december  the company has borrowed from the multi currency revolver in us currency only 
the term loan runs through july and has an outstanding principal balance of million at december  the three month libor effective rate at december  was 
a hypothetical ten percent increase in three month libor rates could result in approximately  annual increase in interest expense on the existing principal balances 
in order to reduce variable interest rate exposure on borrowings under its existing credit facility  trimble had an interest rate swap agreement on a portion of the variable rate debt  which fixes the rate on the notional amount of million at 
this agreement expired in february and was not renewed 
the company also has million of euro denominated debt  classified as a current liability at the end of fiscal the interest rate on this instrument is fixed at six percent 
a hypothetical ten percent decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on the results of operations of the company as related to this debt 
in addition  the company has a million promissory note  of which  was classified as a current liability at the end of fiscal the note is payable in monthly installments  bearing a variable interest rate of as of december  a hypothetical ten percent increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on the results of operations of the company 
the hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future 
furthermore  the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by trimble s management  should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time 
as a result  actual earnings effects in the future will differ from those quantified above 
foreign currency exchange rate risk trimble hedges identified risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings 
trimble utilizes forward contracts to hedge certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables 
these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements  as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the hedge contracts 
all hedge instruments are marked to market through earnings every period 
certain intercompany transactions such as the sale of products between our spectra precision group entities are not specifically hedged utilizing forward contracts  because the company believes that it has a natural hedge through its worldwide operating structure 
the company s practice is to settle these intercompany transactions on a timely basis which reduces our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements 
trimble does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position utilizing our current hedging strategy 
all forward contracts have a maturity of less than six months  and we do not defer any gains and losses with respect to such contracts  as they are all accounted for through earnings in each period
