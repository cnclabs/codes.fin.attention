item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal market risks are interest rates on various debt instruments and foreign exchange rates at the company s international subsidiaries 
interest rates the company centrally manages its domestic debt considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
this domestic debt consists of a line of credit with interest rates based on the eurodollar rate or the federal funds rate 
international debt relates to the company s japan subsidiaries and is used to fund the purchases of coupon equipment and billboards and for day to day operations 
additionally  the rent expenses associated with the lease financing agreement with a special purpose entity for the company s corporate headquarters are based on fluctuating short term interest rates 
these rates are based on the libor rate and can be adjusted based on short term rates up to six months 
a one point change in interest rates  based on the march  debt and off balance sheet obligations  would not have a material impact on the company s operations 
foreign operations operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates  which can be volatile at times 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on catalina marketing is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause the company to adjust its financing and operating strategies 
catalina marketing s net sales at its foreign subsidiaries represented approximately of the company s total net sales in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal the aggregate foreign exchange effect included in determining consolidated results of operations were approximately a  loss in the company s total net income in fiscal   loss in fiscal  and  gain in fiscal the company has not utilized derivative financial instruments to reduce the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies 
the company estimates that based upon the march  balance sheet  a change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material effect on operating profit 
the company believes that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because it does not take into account the impact of macroeconomic factors or changes in either results of operations or our financing and operating strategies
