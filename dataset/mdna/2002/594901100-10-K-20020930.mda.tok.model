revenue recognition revenue from hardware sales is recognized at the time of shipment with a provision for estimated returns and allowances 
revenue from licensed software sales is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
if a third party can install the software  revenue is recognized when shipped  with an appropriate deferral for any undelivered software contract elements 
however  if micros has the proprietary knowledge to install the software  revenue is recognized upon installation and when ready to go live  with an appropriate deferral for any undelivered software contract elements 
this deferral is earned when significant obligations no longer exist 
revenue from customer specific development work is recognized under the completed contract method 
service contract revenue is initially recorded as deferred service revenue and is recognized on a pro rata basis over the contract term 
revenue from the installation of the product and the training of customer s staff is recognized as the work is performed 
capitalized software development costs software development costs  for software products to be licensed to others  incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are charged to operations and included in research and development costs 
software development costs incurred after establishing technological feasibility and purchased software costs are capitalized on a product by product basis until the product is available for general release to customers upon which amortization begins 
annual amortization  charged to cost of sales  is the greater of the amount computed using the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product  or the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired subsidiaries and investees 
goodwill and intangible assets are stated on the basis of cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated periods of benefit  none of which exceeds years 
recoverability is assessed whenever adverse events and changes in circumstances indicate that undiscounted cash flows previously anticipated warrant reassessment 
beginning in july  the company will discontinue the amortization of goodwill based on statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
bad debt micros maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses which may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these allowances are based on customer payment practices and history  inquiries  credit reports from third parties and other financial information 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized 
if the company determines that it will not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination is made

the assets and liabilities of non us operations whose functional currencies are not in us dollar are translated at the fiscal year end exchange rates  while revenues and expenses are translated at month end exchange rates during the fiscal year 
the cumulative translation effects are reflected in shareholders equity 
gains and losses on transactions denominated in other than the functional currency of an operation are reflected in other income expense
