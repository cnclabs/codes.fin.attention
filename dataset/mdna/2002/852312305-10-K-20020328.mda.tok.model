item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all sales by the company are denominated in us dollars or the currency of the country of origin and  accordingly  the company does not enter into hedging transactions with regard to any foreign currencies 
currency fluctuations can  however  increase the price of the company s products to its foreign customers which can adversely impact the level of the company s export sales from time to time

we are also exposed to the impact of interest rate changes 
for example  based on average bank borrowings of million during a three month period  if the interest rate indices on which our bank borrowing rates are based were to increase basis points in the three month period  interest incurred would increase and cash flow would decrease by
