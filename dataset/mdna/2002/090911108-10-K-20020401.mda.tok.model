item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  contained elsewhere in this report  before deciding to invest in our company or to maintain or increase your investment 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are a the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and b that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  beginning on page f revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we have concluded that our revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sab warranty expense 
products sold are generally covered by a warranty against defects in material and workmanship for a period of one year 
we accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
we estimate costs to service warranty obligations based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  warranty accrual will increase  resulting in decreased gross profit 
valuation of long lived assets 
property  plant and equipment  intangible and certain other long lived assets are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
inventory 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the first in  first out method 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of inventories and record an allowance for obsolescence based on such evaluation  with a corresponding provision included in cost of sales 
material differences in estimates of obsolete inventory may result in the amount and timing of cost of sales for any period if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
litigation and other contingencies 
we regularly evaluate our exposure to threatened or pending litigation and other business contingencies 
because of the uncertainties related to the amount of loss from litigation and other business contingencies  the recording of losses relating to such exposures requires significant judgment about the potential range of outcomes 
to date  we have not been affected by any litigation or other contingencies that have had  or are currently anticipated to have  a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
as additional information about current or future litigation or other contingencies becomes available  we will assess whether such information warrants the recording of additional expense relating to its contingencies 
such additional expense could potentially have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
results of operations net sales 
net sales increased by to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to a  or million growth in domestic sales of our waterlase tm system 
domestic sales were also boosted in the third and fourth quarters of by the introduction of our lasersmile tm cosmetic whitening system 
these increases were offset by a  or million decrease in international sales in as we concentrated our resources on growing sales in the domestic market 
we are re evaluating our international distribution methods and taking steps to strengthen our position internationally 
the acquisition of the laser facility in germany represents one of those steps 
in addition to being able to manufacture closer to the customer  we anticipate that the local presence of a field technical staff will improve our customer service and enhance sales growth 
we anticipate that our recent receipt of fda clearances to market our waterlase tm system for root canal therapy and for bone applications should have an incrementally positive effect on sales growth in however  the full benefit of these clearances may not be realized until years beyond as practitioners learn to apply this technology to complex procedures 
net sales grew to million in from million in a key factor in the growth was a increase in export sales to million in alliances with international distributors primarily drove the increase in export sales 
in particular  during  we recommenced sales to germany through a new german distributor 
we believe the german market represents one of the largest markets for our products in europe 
we also commenced sales in france  korea  taiwan and japan during domestic sales also grew in but at a lesser rate than in the previous year as some customers deferred purchases in anticipation of the introduction of a new and improved model of our hard tissue laser system  now known as the waterlase tm 
the introduction of the twilite tm diode laser system predecessor of our lasersmile tm system also added to sales growth in both products were introduced during the third quarter of gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in this increase was largely the result of spreading the fixed costs of manufacturing over more units  an improvement in labor productivity  and engineering cost reductions in the material components of the products 
gross margin increased from of net sales in to of net sales in we expect to make further productivity improvements in labor and materials 
however  we also expect to see step increases in fixed costs related to growth  which will constrain the increases in gross profit resulting from volume and productivity improvements 
fixed costs related to our german facility  although not expected to be significant  are an example of such step costs 
gross profit increased in from million in gross margin increased to of net sales in from of net sales in the improvement in the gross margin was due principally to increased sales volume  combined with the improved design of the waterlase tm system  which resulted in lower material costs and increased manufacturing efficiencies 
the introduction of the twilite tm diode laser system during the third quarter of also contributed to the higher gross margins 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense increased to million in compared to million in as a percent of net sales  however  these expenses decreased to in from in the increase in absolute dollars was largely due to the increase in net sales in and included increased sales commissions and an increase in the number of sales representatives 
marketing costs also increased as we increased the number of trade shows  seminars and symposiums that we attended and sponsored 
we plan to continue to invest heavily in sales and marketing activities to increase dentists awareness of the benefits of our technology 
however  we expect that  as a percent of sales  these expenses will continue to decrease slowly 
sales and marketing expense increased in from million in as a percent of net sales  sales and marketing expense increased to in from in the increase in absolute dollars and as a percent of net sales was primarily due to i higher sales volume  ii the expansion of our domestic sales force and marketing infrastructure  iii increased marketing and advertising costs  and iv an increase in the number of teaching and educational seminars and activities promoting our products  both domestically and abroad 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased to million in from million in as a percent of net sales  general and administrative expense decreased to of net sales in from of net sales in the increase in absolute dollars in primarily related to the cost of infrastructure needed to support the growth of the business 
we also experienced increases in the cost of insurance not only related to growth but also as a result of tighter insurance market conditions 
we expect insurance pricing increases to continue in general and administrative expense decreased in from million in absent  in non recurring charges  which were included in  general and administrative expense in absolute dollars for would reflect a nominal decrease of compared to engineering and development expense 
engineering and development expense decreased to million in from million in as a percent of net sales  engineering and development expense decreased to of net sales in from of net sales in this decrease was related to the change in the development cycle for our products 
engineering costs also decreased as a result of process improvements  which reduced the number of employees needed to sustain the activities of the function 
our engineering efforts are currently directed at new product development plus continuing product improvement on our laser systems 
development efforts are currently focused on strengthening our patent portfolio and obtaining fda clearances for additional applications for existing and future products 
engineering and development expense decreased in from million in after consideration of  of non recurring charges included in fiscal related to the acquisition of laser skin toner  inc see note in the consolidated financial statements  engineering and development expense for would have reflected an increase of from this increase was principally due to development of the waterlase tm system and the lasersmile tm system 
gain on sale of assets 
the gain on sale of assets of  in is primarily related to two transactions 
in  we purchased our san clemente manufacturing facility and offices in order to avoid moving our operations 
in  we sold the facility and leased it back for a five year term with an additional five year option  resulting in a gain of  we are recognizing that gain for accounting purposes over the term of the lease 
in  we recognized  of this gain 
we also sold inventory and assets relating to our inactive subsidiary  societe endotechnic  in for a gain of  interest income decreased in principally due to lower short term interest rates in interest expense remained relatively unchanged from to although the variable interest rate on our line of credit decreased with other short term interest rates in  we incurred interest expense on the mortgage note payable that financed the purchase of our facility 
the interest expense from the mortgage note for three months of offset the decrease in interest on our line of credit 
interest income increased in primarily due to higher average cash balances maintained in interest bearing accounts over the previous year  as well as higher interest rates on short term cash investments 
interest expense increased over primarily due to a higher average balance during on our line of credit than in  as well as higher interest rates for short term debt 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in working capital 
our working capital requirements in and were financed through the private placement of equity securities  netting proceeds of million and million  respectively 
we also received proceeds in and from the exercise of warrants and stock options in the amounts of million and  respectively 
in  we incurred negative cash flow of million from operating activities  substantially all resulting from the net increase in working capital 
we financed our negative cash flow from operations through exercise of warrants and options of  and from net cash received on the sale of our facility of million 
at december   cash and cash equivalents was million compared to million at the end of accounts receivable  net  increased to million at december  from  at december  the increase was due to the higher sales volume experienced in the fourth quarter for which the receivable will be collected in the first quarter of we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  of  is adequate to provide for anticipated losses on uncollectible amounts 
inventories  net  increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase was due to increased production necessary to meet sales and expected demand 
inventory turnover improved during to an average of times  or every days  from an average of times  or every days in we expect inventory levels to increase in in support of anticipated higher sales levels 
our business continues to focus on the manufacturing and marketing of laser based technologies the waterlase tm and the lasersmile tm laser systems 
financing the development of our products and our operations has been achieved principally through the private placements of common stock and the exercise of stock options and warrants  though we have experienced significant increased sales over the last two years 
during the three years ended december   we have raised approximately million of net equity funds in this manner 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents  cash generated from operations and amounts available under our current revolving credit agreement will be adequate to meet our debt service requirements  capital expenditures and sustain our operations through the end of fiscal should we require further capital resources in  we would most likely address such requirement through a combination of product sales  sales of equity securities through private placements  and or debt financing 
if such additional debt or equity is needed  no assurances can be given that we would be able to obtain such additional capital resources 
if unexpected events occur requiring us to obtain additional capital and we are unable to do so  we then might attempt to preserve our available resources by deferring the creation or satisfaction of various commitments  deferring the introduction of various products or entry into various markets  or otherwise scaling back our operations 
if we were unable to raise such additional capital or defer certain costs as described above  such inability would have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
at december   we had million outstanding under a revolving credit agreement with a bank 
the revolving credit agreement provides for borrowings of up to million for the financing of inventory and is collateralized by substantially all of our accounts receivable and inventories 
the interest rate is computed based upon libor plus 
the balance at december  was million and during  there were no draws or repayments 
we do not intend to make any further borrowings under this line of credit in the immediate future 
in may  this line of credit will be reduced to million 
the current revolving credit agreement expires on january   at which point we will be required either to pay any remaining balance of the credit facility or refinance the credit facility 
in addition  during  we expect that warrants expiring in will be exercised  generating up to an additional million from external sources 
in february  our wholly owned subsidiary  biolase europe purchased a production facility in germany with ten employees for  we are required to pay the first installment of the purchase price by may  the amount of the first installment will be determined by us  but must be between  and  thereafter  we must pay  by april  and the balance of the purchase price  if any  must be paid by december  we are currently negotiating with a third party for that party to pay all or a portion of the first installment in exchange for certain rights that we would grant to the third party 
in the event we do not reach an agreement with this third party  then both the purchase price and the initial installment will be reduced by  the facility  which is iso certified  consists of two buildings equipped for laser production 
this facility will substantially increase our production capacity 
biolase europe also has a highly qualified technical staff experienced in laser principles and design  delivery systems  optics  technical service and field support 
biolase europe will manufacture our products in germany  provide direct support for our expanding international dealer network and contribute to our ongoing research and development of new products 
we have no other material commitments for capital expenditures 
selected quarterly financial data quarters ended march  june  september  december  amounts in thousands  except per share data net sales     gross profit     income loss from operations net income loss net income loss per share basic and diluted net sales     gross profit    loss from operations   net loss   net loss per share basic and diluted impact of changing prices on sales and income inflation has not historically had a material impact on our operating expenses 
the effect of deflation on the pricing of technology products has not yet had a material impact on our ability to price our products 
we are currently unable to predict what effect  if any  it may have in the future 
new accounting pronouncements in june  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  were issued 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and establishes criteria for the separate recognition of intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and certain other intangible assets having indefinite lives no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be subject to periodic testing for impairment 
intangible assets determined to have definite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  however  goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  are subject immediately to the non amortization and amortization provisions of this statement 
as we do not have any goodwill or material intangible assets  the adoption of these statements will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  this statement provides the accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets 
this statement requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this statement retains the requirements of sfas no 
related to long lived asset impairment loss recognition and measurement  but removes goodwill and certain intangibles from its scope 
the statement also requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
risk factors before investing in our company or deciding to maintain or increase your investment  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
we may not be able to continue or increase our net income in the future  which may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
we may not be able to continue to achieve net income 
prior to the third and fourth quarters of  we had not reached the break even point as we transitioned from our research and development phase and began commercializing our technology 
even if we continue to achieve net income  we may not be able to increase net income on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
our ability to achieve sustained or increased net income is  in turn  dependent on many of the other risk factors identified in this report below 
if we are unable to continue or increase our net income in the future  we may not be able to successfully operate our business and our stock price may decline 
we may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our future capital needs 
our line of credit expires on january  if we are unable to renew our line of credit at that time on acceptable terms  or at all  and we are required to repay the line of credit  absent sufficient cash flow from operations or the sale of securities  the diversion of resources for that purpose will adversely affect our operations and financial condition and our ability to achieve future growth in our net sales 
unless we can generate sufficient cash flow from sustained profitability  we will continue to be dependent on the availability of external financing to meet our operating and capital needs  including the repayment of current debt obligations 
we may not be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all  at the time when we need such funding 
if we do raise funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing stockholders would be reduced  and the securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
if we raise additional funds by issuing debt  we may be subject to limitations on our operations  including limitations on the payment of dividends 
our inability to raise additional funds on a timely basis will make it difficult for us to achieve our business plan and will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate in future periods and we may fail to meet expectations  which may cause the price of our common stock to decline 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
if quarterly revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
factors that might cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results include the factors described in the subheadings below as well as 
the evolving and varying demand for dental and medical lasers  
our ability to develop  introduce  market and gain market acceptance of new products and product enhancements in a timely manner  
our ability to control costs  
the size  timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders  
the introduction of new products by competitors  
the availability and reliability of components used to manufacture our products  
changes in our pricing policies or those of our suppliers and competitors  as well as increased price competition in general  
the mix of our domestic and international sales  and the risks and uncertainties associated with our international business  
costs associated with any future acquisitions of technologies and businesses  and 
general global economic and political conditions  including international conflicts and acts of terrorism 
in addition  a significant amount of our sales in any quarter may consist of sales through a single distributor 
as a result  the timing of orders by this distributor may impact our quarter to quarter results 
the loss of or a substantial reduction in orders from this distributor could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
due to all of the factors listed above and the other risks discussed in this report  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance 
our business depends on the acceptance of our products  and it is uncertain whether the market will broadly accept our products 
our future success will depend on our ability to demonstrate to dentists and physicians the potential cost and performance advantages of our laser systems over traditional methods of treatment and  to a lesser extent  over competitive laser systems 
our products represent relatively new technologies in the dental market  and have not yet achieved widespread market acceptance 
factors that may inhibit mass adoption of laser technologies by dentists and physicians include the cost of the products  concerns about the safety  efficacy and reliability of lasers and the ability to obtain reimbursement of laser procedures under health plans 
current economic pressure may make dentists and physicians reluctant to purchase substantial capital equipment or invest in new technologies 
the failure of medical lasers to achieve broad market acceptance would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to successfully market our products to achieve broad market acceptance 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers  and if we cannot secure alternate suppliers  our business may be harmed 
we purchase certain raw materials and components included in our products from a limited group of qualified suppliers  and we do not have long term supply contracts with any of our key suppliers 
our growth and ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of materials and components from our suppliers 
certain components of our products are currently available only from a single source or limited sources 
although we believe that alternate sources of supply are available for most of our single sourced materials and components  a change in a single or limited source supplier  or an inability to find an alternate supplier  could create manufacturing delays  disrupt sales and cash flow  and harm our reputation  any of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur expenses to enforce our rights 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and technology  to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the intellectual property of others 
we rely on patents to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any further patents  that any of our proprietary rights will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that any such rights will provide a sustainable competitive advantage 
competitors may claim that we have infringed their current or future intellectual property rights 
we may not prevail in any future intellectual property infringement litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in litigation 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming and distracting to management  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
additionally  in the event an intellectual property claim against us is successful  we might not be able to obtain a license on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign our products to avoid infringement 
any of the foregoing adverse events could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have significant international sales and are subject to risks associated with operating in international markets 
in the past few years  international sales have comprised a significant portion of our net sales 
our international sales declined significantly in the current year  and political and economic conditions outside the united states could make it difficult for us to increase our international sales or to operate abroad 
in the future  we intend to continue to pursue and expand our international business activities 
international operations are subject to many inherent risks  including 
political  social and economic instability  
fluctuations in currency exchange rates  
exposure to different legal standards  
reduced protection for our intellectual property in some countries  
burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  
import and export license requirements and restrictions of the united states and each other country in which we operate  
trade restrictions  
the imposition of governmental controls  
unexpected changes in regulatory or certification requirements  
changes in tariffs  
difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  
longer collection periods and difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities  and 
potentially adverse tax consequences 
we believe that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales  and that continued growth and profitability may require further expansion of our international operations 
a substantial percentage of our international sales are denominated in the local currency 
as a result  an increase in the relative value of the dollar could make our products more expensive and potentially less price competitive in international markets 
we do not currently engage in any transactions as a hedge against risks of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations 
any of these factors may adversely affect our future international sales and  consequently  affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
product liability claims against us could be costly and could harm our reputation 
the sale of dental and medical products involves the inherent risk of product liability claims against us 
while we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage in an amount that we believe is adequate for our level of sales  this insurance is expensive  is subject to various coverage exclusions and may not be obtainable in the future on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we do not know whether claims against us  if any  with respect to our products will be successfully defended or whether our insurance will be sufficient to cover liabilities resulting from such claims 
rapid changes in technology could harm the demand for our products or result in significant additional costs 
the markets in which our laser products compete are subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in the regulatory environment  frequent new device and pharmaceutical introductions and evolving dental and surgical techniques 
these changes could render our products noncompetitive or obsolete 
the success of our existing and future products is dependent on the differentiation of our products from those of our competitors  the timely introduction of new products and the perceived benefit to the customer in terms of patient service and return on investment 
the process of developing new medical devices is inherently complex and requires regulatory approvals or clearances that can be expensive  time consuming and uncertain 
we have in the past experienced delays in product development 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities  be financially or otherwise capable of the research and development to bring new products to market in a timely manner or that product and technologies developed by others will not render our products obsolete 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
our products compete with those of a number of foreign and domestic companies  including those companies that market traditional dental products such as dental drills  as well as other companies that market laser technologies in the dental and medical markets that we address 
some of our competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources than us 
this may allow them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and to devote greater resources to the development and introduction of enhanced products than we can 
in addition  the rapid technological changes occurring in the healthcare industry are expected to lead to the entry of new competitors  especially as dental and medical lasers gain increasing market acceptance 
our ability to anticipate technological changes and to introduce enhanced products on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to grow and remain competitive 
new competitors or technology changes in laser products and methods could cause commoditization of such products  require price discounting or otherwise adversely affect our gross margins 
changes in government regulation or the inability to obtain necessary government approvals could harm our business 
our products are subject to extensive government regulation  both in the united states and other countries 
to clinically test  manufacture and market products for human diagnostic and therapeutic use  we must comply with regulations and safety standards set by the us food and drug administration and comparable state and foreign agencies 
generally  products must meet regulatory standards as safe and effective for their intended use prior to being marketed for human applications 
the clearance process is expensive  time consuming and uncertain 
the failure to receive requisite approvals for the use of our products or processes  or significant delays in obtaining such approvals  could prevent us from developing  manufacturing and marketing products and services necessary for us to remain competitive 
if our customers cannot obtain third party reimbursement for their use of our products  they may be less inclined to purchase our products 
our products are generally purchased by dental or medical professionals who then bill various third party payors  such as government programs or private insurance plans  for the procedures conducted using these products 
in the united states third party payors review and frequently challenge the prices charged for medical services 
in many foreign countries  the prices are predetermined through government regulation 
payors may deny coverage and reimbursement if they determine that the procedure was not medically necessary for example  cosmetic or that the device used in the procedure was investigational 
we believe that most of the procedures being performed with our current products generally have been reimbursed  with the exception of cosmetic applications such as tooth whitening 
the inability to obtain reimbursement for services using our products could deter dentists and physicians from purchasing or using our products 
we cannot predict the effect of future healthcare reforms or changes in financing for health and dental plans 
any such changes could have an adverse effect on the ability of a dental or medical professional to generate a return on investment using our current or future products 
such changes would act as disincentives for capital investments by dental and medical professionals and could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the failure to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our business 
our future success depends in part on the continued service of certain key personnel  including jeffrey w 
jones  our chief executive officer  edson j 
rood  our chief financial officer  ioana rizoiu  our vice president of clinical research  and keith bateman  our vice president of global sales 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our key employees  other than with mr 
jones  whose employment agreement was renewed in january for an additional two year term 
our success will also depend in large part on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified engineering and other highly skilled technical personnel 
competition for employees  particularly development engineers  is intense 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain sufficient numbers of such highly skilled employees 
our inability to attract and retain additional key employees or the loss of one or more of our current key employees could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
potential future acquisitions could have unintended negative consequences which could harm our business and cause our stock price to decline 
we may consider pursuing acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies in the future as a part of our growth strategy 
acquisitions could require significant capital infusions and could involve many risks  including but not limited to the following 
we may encounter difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  products and workforce of the acquired companies  
acquisitions may materially and adversely affect our results of operations because they may require large one time charges or could result in increased debt or contingent liabilities  adverse tax consequences  substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges  or the amortization of amounts related to deferred compensation  goodwill and other intangible assets  
acquisitions may be dilutive to our existing stockholders  
acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management  and 
key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify or consummate any future acquisitions on acceptable terms  or at all 
in the event we do pursue any acquisitions  it is possible that we may not realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisitions 
our common stock price has been volatile  which could result in substantial losses for individual stockholders 
our common stock is currently traded on the nasdaq small cap market and has only limited daily trading volume 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
the market for technology companies  in particular  has  from time to time  experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may significantly affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
for example  the closing per share sale price of our common stock fluctuated from to over the prior fiscal year despite steady improvement in our financial performance 
on august   the closing sale price of our common stock declined from per share on volume of approximately  shares  absent any news about or announcements by us 
the trading price of our common stock could be affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  changes in expectations of our future performance  changes in estimates by securities analysts or failure to meet such estimates  quarterly fluctuations in our revenue and financial results and a variety of risk factors  including the ones described elsewhere in this report 
periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities sometimes result in securities class action litigation 
if this were to happen to us  such litigation would be expensive and would divert management s attention 
in addition  with only a limited public market for our stock  it would be difficult to sell a significant amount of our stock  which could cause a significant decline in the trading price of our stock 
if our stock price drops below per share for an extended period of time or we are otherwise unable to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq small cap market  our shares could be delisted from the nasdaq small cap market and the marketability  liquidity and price of our common stock would be adversely affected 
we are exposed to risks associated with the recent worldwide economic slowdown and related uncertainties 
concerns about decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  and recent international conflicts and terrorist and military activity have resulted in a downturn in economic conditions  both domestically and internationally 
these unfavorable economic conditions could ultimately cause a slowdown in customer orders  an increase in the number of cancellations and the rescheduling of backlog  if any 
in addition  recent political and social turmoil related to international conflicts and terrorist acts may put further pressure on economic conditions in the us and worldwide 
unstable political  social and economic conditions make it difficult for our customers  our suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
if such conditions continue or worsen  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
future sales of our common stock could affect the stock price 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock  including shares issued on the exercise of options and warrants  in the public market  the market price of our common stock could fall 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
as of december   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
all of these shares  other than shares held by affiliates  are freely tradable

in the event that a third party acquires or more of our outstanding common stock  the holders of these rights will be able to purchase the underlying junior participating preferred stock as a way to discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company

the existence of these features could prevent others from seeking to acquire shares of our common stock in transactions at premium prices
