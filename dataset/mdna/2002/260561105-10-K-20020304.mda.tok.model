contract guarantee 
in  the company completed the sale of its telerate business to bridge information systems bridge 
under the terms of the sale  dow jones retained its guarantee of payments of certain annual minimum payments for data acquired by telerate from cantor fitzgerald securities cantor and market data corporation mdc under contracts entered into when telerate was a subsidiary of dow jones 
as further discussed herein  in december  the company established a reserve in the amount of million representing the present value of the estimated annual minimum payments over the remainder of the contract through october  using a discount rate of approximately 
at december   the company s reserve for the contract guarantee was million 
the reserve reduction resulted from dow jones making a million payment under its guarantee for amounts not paid by bridge prior to its bankruptcy  payments totaling million that bridge made after its bankruptcy filing  partially offset by amortization of discount on the reserve balance of million 
in october  the bankruptcy court granted bridge s motion to reject telerate s contracts with cantor and mdc 
telerate has indicated that it has ceased operations and is no longer receiving the government securities data from cantor and mdc and will not be making payments to cantor and mdc 
cantor and mdc advised the company that they would be seeking payment from dow jones of an amount they allege was due on november under the contract guarantee and future payments due through the company has various substantial defenses to these claims 
on november   the company filed a lawsuit in the supreme court of the state of new york seeking a declaratory judgment with respect to the contract guarantee and the claims of cantor and mdc 
in this lawsuit the company has asked the court to find that the company does not and will not owe any payment under the contract guarantee through october in the alternative  the company has asked the court to find that if any amount is owed  it must be reduced by amounts that cantor and mdc receive or should have received from other distribution of the data 
mdc and cantor fitzgerald have filed motions to dismiss  counterclaims  and an additional lawsuit against the company disagreeing with the company s position and asserting damages of approximately million 
due to the stage of the lawsuit at december   it is not possible to determine whether the court will find that any obligation the company had under the guarantee may be dismissed or reduced 
accordingly  the company believes the balance of the reserve continues to be appropriate 
write down of investments 
in  the company realized a loss of million from impairment in the value of its investments in nation multimedia group public co 
million  and ibeam broadcasting corp 
million 
these investments are marketable equity securities  which are carried at their market price 
prior to the realization of losses for these investments in the third quarter of  the company recorded the unrealized losses associated with these investments directly to other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
the company holds a less than interest in nation multimedia group public company  a diversified media company based in thailand  which is publicly traded on the bangkok exchange 
prior to and during there had been volatility in the market price of nation multimedia 
at december  the company s investment in nation multimedia was valued at million and the company had recorded million of unrealized losses through other comprehensive income 
the company s investment continued to decline in  and in the third quarter the company determined the impairment of the investment was other than temporary 
this determination was based on the investment s declining market price in  approximately a decline through september   combined with increased economic uncertainty in southeast asia  which was significantly heightened after the september terrorist attacks 
in october  the company received shares of ibeam broadcasting corporation ibeam in exchange for the company s shares of nextvenue inc the company valued the consideration based on the market value of the shares it received on the date the purchase of nextvenue was consummated in october the market value of ibeam began to deteriorate in the fourth quarter of and continued to deteriorate throughout as of december   the company had recorded million of unrealized losses in other comprehensive income 
in march  ibeam s k public filing included a going concern opinion 
in april  ibeam announced it would restructure its operations and was considering selling the company 
in may  nasdaq notified ibeam that it may be delisted because its stock was trading below the minimum 
ibeam received an extension and in september  its shareholders approved a one for ten reverse stock split  which was expected to raise the market value 
the reverse stock split failed to increase the market value and the stock continued to trade below the minimum trading level  and a delisting was likely 
considering the impact of the september terrorist attacks on the economy  a near term rebound was not likely 
therefore  the company realized a loss of its full million investment in september subsequent to the company s write down  ibeam announced it was filing for bankruptcy and selling its assets 
special items in equity investments 
equity in losses of associated companies included special items netting to a charge of million  as follows a charge of million related to a loss on an office lease abandoned by smartmoney  a gain of million related to the early extinguishment of debt at cnbc europe  and a charge of million for costs related to the shut down of work 
com 
special items in  the company recorded special items which netted to a loss of million million after taxes and minority interest  or per share  as follows the company recorded write downs totaling million  on the company s investments in bridge and optimark technologies  inc optimark and a reserve of million for a contract guarantee related to the sale of telerate 
these charges were partially offset by net gains on sales of businesses and investments totaling million 
also  in  a restructuring charge million after taxes relating to an equity investment was reversed  resulting from the favorable disposition of a satellite lease in europe 
additional details of the above items follows  with a summary provided in the table on page investment write downs 
the company wrote down the carrying value of its investments in bridge and savvis communications corp 
in aggregate  million and optimark technologies  inc million 
dow jones accounted for these investments under the cost method  therefore  changes in the value of the investment are not recognized unless there is impairment in value of the investment that is deemed to be other than temporary 
it is the company s policy to continually monitor investments for indications of impairment 
the purchase price for the sale of telerate in to bridge consisted of million aggregate par value of year  redeemable  convertible  preferred stock of bridge  which was included in other investments  and cash of million 
in  dow jones acquired approximately million shares of savvis communications corp 
at cents per share for an aggregate cost of 
million and issued subordinated debt to bridge which had a carrying value including interest of million 
bridge was savvis largest customer and shareholder and a significant vendor for technical support services 
throughout  bridge experienced continued operating shortfalls from plan and experienced a need for substantial relief from its bank lenders and additional financing 
these developments  when combined with the pricing of its third quarter issuance of convertible notes  clearly demonstrated that there was a decline in the value of the company s preferred stock holdings 
in addition  bridge notified its lenders that as of september  it was not in compliance with certain financial covenants under its outstanding credit agreement 
bridge s principal shareholder had taken over management of the company and launched several initiatives focused on improving operations  increasing revenues and raising additional capital 
however  there was no assurance that these efforts would be successful 
these factors  combined with the lack of updated long term forward projections  left dow jones management with insufficient objective evidence to determine that the decline in value of the company s preferred stock holdings was temporary 
using the third quarter convertible notes financing transaction as a benchmark  dow jones recorded a charge to earnings in the third quarter of of million to write down this investment there was no tax benefit as this was a capital loss 
also  the company discontinued accruing dividends on its preferred stock holdings effective with the third quarter of the revised carrying value for this investment at september  was million 
bridge s financial position continued to deteriorate during the fourth quarter of  and it continued to experience severe operational difficulties 
during the fourth quarter and continuing into january and early february  bridge s primary investor  welsh carson anderson stowe  engaged in negotiations with bridge and its lenders in an effort to reach an agreement to restructure bridge s debt  arrange additional financing and significantly reorganize its operations 
however  those negotiations did not reach a successful conclusion and on february  bridge filed a petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code with a view to seeking a sale of its assets in order to repay its creditors in whole or in part 
in light of the foregoing events  dow jones concluded that its bridge related investments had been further impaired  and were now worthless 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  the company wrote off million representing the remaining value of the bridge preferred stock  the bridge subordinated debt and the savvis stock 
the company holds a minority interest in optimark technologies  inc consisting of preferred and common shares with an aggregate cost of million 
during the second quarter of  optimark began experiencing operating and cash flow difficulties 
the conditions worsened during the third quarter which prompted optimark to institute a short term restructuring plan and seek additional financing to sustain its operations 
the company believed that any impairment in this investment was only temporary 
in the fourth quarter  the company was advised that the additional financing had been delayed 
in addition  optimark s short term restructuring plan was not generating sufficient cash flow 
public filings also indicated there was question of optimark s ability to continue as a going concern 
as a result of these factors  the company determined that the impairment was other than temporary and wrote off the full investment in the fourth quarter of contract guarantee 
under the terms of the company s sale of telerate  dow jones retained its guarantee of payments under certain circumstances of certain annual minimum payments for data acquired by telerate from cantor fitzgerald securities cantor and market data corporation mdc under contracts entered into when telerate was a subsidiary of dow jones 
the annual minimum payments average approximately million per year through october under certain conditions 
bridge agreed to indemnify dow jones for any liability dow jones incurred under the contract guarantee with respect to periods subsequent to bridge s purchase of telerate 
however  bridge filed for bankruptcy protection on february  after unsuccessful attempts to reorganize its operations and arrange for additional financing 
dow jones believes that mdc and cantor have the obligation to cover  mitigate or otherwise reduce or avoid any losses or damages to dow jones under the contract guarantee  including by securing the best possible commercial terms for the supply of the subject data to a third party or parties 
mdc and cantor deny that they have this obligation 
dow jones believes that any and all amounts which are received by mdc and or cantor in respect of such data would reduce any liability that dow jones might have under the contract guarantee 
as of december   there was a high degree of uncertainty  however  as to what value the data might have in the marketplace  whether an agreement would be reached by mdc and or cantor to supply the data to a third party or parties  the financial position of such party or parties  the timing of any such agreement  and various related factors 
therefore  it was not possible for dow jones to determine with any certainty that any such offsets would in fact be realized  or at what time or in what amounts 
consequently  in december  the company established a reserve in the amount of million representing the present value of the estimated annual minimum payments over the remainder of the contract through october using a discount rate of approximately 
as explained above  dow jones has commenced a lawsuit which is opposed by mdc and cantor seeking to establish the absence of any liability under the guarantee

per share in these capital loss carryforwards  which largely related to the sale of telerate  had been previously fully reserved

our journal linage expectations track these assumptions  and also include the benefits of our color print expansion project such that  for the full year  we assume mid single digit linage growth at the wall street journal

we will continue to control expenses  which will be about to below year ago levels in the quarter
