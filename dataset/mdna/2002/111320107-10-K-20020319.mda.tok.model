item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto  included in part iv  item of this report  and the risk factors section at the end of this item  before deciding to invest in our company or to maintain or increase your investment 
in this report  all share numbers and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect our for stock splits  each in the form of a stock dividend  effective february  and february  overview we are the leading provider of highly integrated silicon solutions that enable broadband communications and networking of voice  video and data services 
using proprietary technologies and advanced design methodologies  we design  develop and supply complete system on a chip solutions and related hardware and software applications for every major broadband communications market 
our diverse product portfolio includes solutions for digital cable set top boxes and cable modems  high speed local  metropolitan and wide area and optical networks  home networking  voip  carrier access  residential broadband gateways  direct broadcast satellite and terrestrial digital broadcast  dsl  wireless communications  systemi o server solutions  and broadband network processors 
from broadcom s inception in through  we were primarily engaged in product development and the establishment of strategic customer and foundry relationships 
during that period  we generated the majority of our revenue from development work performed for key customers 
we began shipping our products in  and subsequently our revenue has increased predominantly through sales of our semiconductor products 
we intend to continue to enter into development contracts with key customers  but expect that future development revenue will constitute a small percentage of our total revenue 
we also generate a small percentage of our product revenue from the licensing of software and the provision of software support services and from licenses of system level reference designs 
the percentage of our net revenue derived from independent customers located outside of the united states was approximately in  in and in all of our revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
from time to time  our key customers have placed large orders causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly 
we expect these fluctuations will continue 
sales to motorola  including sales to its manufacturing subcontractors  represented approximately of our net revenue in  of our net revenue in and of our net revenue in sales to com  including sales to its manufacturing subcontractors  represented approximately of our net revenue in and of our net revenue in sales to cisco  including sales to its manufacturing subcontractors  represented approximately of our net revenue in and of our net revenue in sales to our five largest customers which customers have varied from year to year  including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors  represented approximately of our net revenue in  of our net revenue in and of our net revenue in we expect that our key customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in and for the foreseeable future 
our gross margin has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following our product mix  the position of our products in their respective life cycles  competitive pricing strategies  manufacturing cost efficiencies and inefficiencies  amortization of purchased intangible assets  stock based compensation expense  the fair value of performance based warrants earned by certain customers  and the mix of product revenue and development revenue 
for example  newly introduced products generally have higher average selling prices and gross margins  both of which typically decline over product life cycles due to competitive pressures and volume pricing agreements 
our gross margin and results of operations may continue to fluctuate as a result of these and other factors 

table of contents the cycle for test  evaluation and adoption of our products by customers can range from three to six months or more  with an additional three to nine months or more before a customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our products 
moreover  in light of the recent significant economic slowdown in the technology sector  it may take significantly longer than three to nine months before customers commence volume production of equipment incorporating some of our products 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience significant delays between incurring expenses for research and development and selling  general and administrative efforts  and investments in inventory  and the generation of corresponding revenue  if any 
furthermore  during and thereafter  we may continue to increase our investment in research and development  selling  general and administrative functions and inventory 
we anticipate that the rate of new orders may vary significantly from month to month 
if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our results of operations for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  would be materially and adversely affected 
a key element of our business strategy involves the acquisition of businesses  products or technologies that allow us to reduce the time required to develop new technologies and products and bring them to market  complement our existing product offerings  expand our market coverage  increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities 
we plan to continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions from time to time  and may make additional acquisitions in the future 
during and we completed acquisitions that were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  for aggregate equity consideration of billion 
in these acquisitions included visiontech ltd  a supplier of digital video audio mpeg compression and decompression chips  serverworks corporation  a supplier of high performance system input output integrated circuits for servers  workstations and storage platforms  kimalink  a developer of integrated circuits for wireless data communications  and portatec corporation  a developer of integrated solutions for smart mobile devices 
in these acquisitions included innovent systems  inc  a developer of radio frequency integrated circuits for wireless data communications  puyallup integrated circuit company  inc  a provider of integrated circuit design services  altima communications  inc  a supplier of networking integrated circuits for the small to medium sized business networking market  newport communications  inc  a supplier of mixed signal integrated circuits for the high speed communications infrastructure market  silicon spice inc  a developer of communications processors and other technology for high density voice  fax and data packet transmission over wide area networks  element  inc  a developer of high port density  low power digital subscriber line chipsets  software and communications processor technology  allayer communications  a developer of high performance enterprise and optical networking communications chips  and sibyte  inc  a developer of high performance microprocessor solutions for broadband networking 
because each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a purchase transaction  the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired companies commencing as of their respective acquisition dates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  during and we completed nine acquisitions that were accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting 
in these acquisitions included digital furnace corporation  a developer of communications algorithms and software that increase the capacity of existing broadband networks for interactive services  bluesteel networks  inc  a developer of high performance internet security processors for e commerce and vpn applications  stellar semiconductor  inc  a developer of d graphics technology  and pivotal technologies corporation  a developer of high performance communications links for both wired and wireless environments 
in these acquisitions included maverick networks  a developer of highly integrated silicon solutions for multi layer switching equipment in enterprise networks  epigram  inc  a developer of advanced semiconductor products for high speed home networking  armedia  inc  a developer of high performance digital video decoders  hothaus technologies inc  a provider of openvoip embedded communications software that enables transmission of digital voice  fax and data packets over data networks  including the internet  and altocom  inc  a provider of complete software data fax modem implementations for general purpose embedded processors  pc cpus and digital signal processors 
because each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a pooling of interests transaction  our historical consolidated financial statements and the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for prior periods have been restated to include the operations of these nine companies as if they had been combined with our company at the beginning of the first period presented 
included in restated net revenue and net loss for were revenue and net losses  aggregating million and million  respectively  from the four pooling of interests transactions completed in that year and incurred prior to the respective closings of those transactions 
included in restated net revenue and net income for were revenue and net losses  aggregating million and million  respectively  incurred prior to the respective closings of the nine pooling of interests transactions 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and allowances  inventory reserves  strategic investments  goodwill and purchased intangible asset valuations  deferred income tax asset valuation allowances  warranty reserves  restructuring costs  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the significant judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue  receivables and inventory 
we recognize product revenue upon concluding that all of the fundamental criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
the criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment  except for shipments to stocking distributors where revenue is recognized upon sale to the end customer 
in addition  we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and allowances such as competitive pricing programs 
should actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates  additional reductions to revenue would result 
our products typically carry a one to three year warranty 
we provide reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  use of materials and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  additional warranty reserves could be required  which could reduce gross margins 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs could be required 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development ipr d 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible assets impact future amortization  the amount assigned to ipr d is expensed immediately 
if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct  purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate long lived assets used in operations  including goodwill and purchased intangible assets  when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns in the semiconductor industry  are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of assets is impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to fair value  which is typically calculated using a weighted average of the market approach and discounted expected future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital 
impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected discounted cash flows 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates of anticipated future net revenue  the remaining estimated economic life of the products and technologies  or both  could differ from those used to assess the recoverability of these assets 
in that event  additional impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain long lived assets could be required 
strategic investments 
we have made strategic investments in publicly traded and privately held companies for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
the share prices of the publicly traded securities have been volatile  and the value of the non publicly traded securities is difficult to determine 
we periodically review these investments for other than temporary declines in fair value and write down investments to their fair value when an other than temporary decline has occurred based on the specific identification method 
we generally believe an other than 
table of contents temporary decline has occurred when the fair value of the investment is below the carrying value for two consecutive quarters  absent evidence to the contrary 
fair values for investments in public companies are determined using the quoted market prices 
fair values for investments in privately held companies are estimated based upon one or more of the following pricing models using historical and forecasted financial information  the values of recent rounds of financing  or quoted market prices of comparable public companies 
although we believe our estimates reasonably reflect the fair value of our non publicly traded securities  had there been an active market for the equity securities  the carrying values might have been materially different than the amounts reported 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of companies in which we have such investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value and which could require an impairment charge 
deferred taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we determine that we will not realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we will make an adjustment to the deferred tax assets  which adjustment will be charged to income tax expense in the period of such determination 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated years ended december  net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expense research and development selling  general and administrative stock based compensation amortization of goodwill amortization of purchased intangible assets impairment of goodwill in process research and development restructuring costs litigation settlement costs merger related costs income loss from operations interest income  net other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss years ended december  and net revenue 
our revenue consists principally of product revenue generated by sales of our semiconductor products  and to a much lesser extent  from licenses of software and the provision of software support services and development revenue generated under development contracts with our customers 
net revenue is revenue less provisions for returns and allowances and the fair value of performance based warrants earned by certain customers 
net revenue for was million  a decrease of million or as compared with net revenue of billion in net revenue was reduced by million and million in and  respectively  to account for the fair value of the performance based warrants to purchase shares of class a common stock earned by certain customers in connection with purchase and development agreements that we assumed in prior acquisitions 

table of contents the decline in net revenue for as compared to resulted primarily from a decrease in volume shipments of our semiconductor products for the high speed networking market  digital cable set top boxes and cable modems  as our customers faced slower demand for their products and continued to work through their inventory issues  offset in part by shipments of systemi o server products 
due to the significant economic slowdown in the technology sector and semiconductor industry in  we experienced a significant slowdown in customer orders  as well as an increase in the number of order cancellations and reschedulings of backlog 
we experienced modest revenue growth in the third and fourth quarters of and expect that modest growth to continue in the first quarter of gross profit 
gross profit represents net revenue less the cost of revenue 
cost of revenue includes the cost of purchasing the finished silicon wafers manufactured by independent foundries  costs associated with assembly  packaging  test and quality assurance for semiconductor products  amortization of purchased technology  and costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support and contracted development work 
gross profit for was million or of net revenue  a decrease of million or from gross profit of million or of net revenue in the decrease in gross profit was mainly attributable to the decrease in the volume of semiconductor product shipments as well as non cash acquisition related charges  including amortization of purchased intangible assets and stock based compensation expense 
this decrease was offset in part by cost reductions in the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue for compared with was primarily a result of the non cash acquisition related charges and  to a lesser extent  decreased absorption of manufacturing overhead due to lower production volumes and shifts in our product mix 
approximately million and million of stock based compensation expense were included in cost of revenue in and  respectively 
approximately million and million of amortization of purchased intangible assets were included in cost of revenue in and  respectively 
at december  the unamortized balance of purchased intangible assets that will be amortized to cost of revenue in the future was million  of which million is expected to be amortized in and million is expected to be amortized in see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we anticipate that gross profit will continue to be impacted by the non cash amortization of acquisition related charges 
in addition  gross profit is likely to be impacted in the future by competitive pricing strategies  fluctuations in the volume of our product sales  fluctuations in silicon wafer costs  and the possible future introduction of certain lower margin products 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research  design and development activities  costs related to engineering design tools  subcontracting costs  and facilities expenses 
research and development expense for was million or of net revenue  an increase of million or as compared with research and development expense of million or of net revenue in this increase was primarily due to the addition of personnel through acquisitions and internal hiring  investment in design tools for the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products  and the cost of additional facilities required to support the increase in headcount 
research and development expense in the near term is expected to be slightly higher in absolute dollars than the levels 
due to the significant economic slowdown in the technology sector and current market conditions  we are not currently able to assess the trend of research and development expense thereafter 
however  based upon past experience  we anticipate that research and development expense in absolute dollars will continue to increase over the long term as a result of the growth and diversification of the markets we serve  new product opportunities and our expansion into new markets and technologies 
we will continue to periodically assess our cost structure and product programs to improve operational efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses  professional and legal fees  trade show expenses and facilities expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense for was million or of net revenue  an increase of million or as compared with selling  general and administrative expense of million or of net revenue in this increase reflected higher personnel related costs resulting from the addition of sales and marketing  senior management and administrative personnel through acquisitions and internal hiring as well as increased facilities expenses and legal fees 
selling  general and administrative expense in the near term is expected to be slightly higher in absolute dollars than the levels 
due to the significant economic slowdown in the technology sector and current market conditions  we are not currently able to assess the trend of selling  general and administrative expense thereafter 
however  based upon past experience  we anticipate that over the long term selling  general and administrative expense in absolute dollars will continue to increase to support expansion of our operations through indigenous growth and acquisitions  as a result of periodic changes in our infrastructure to support increased headcount  acquisition and integration activities  and international operations  and in view of the volume of current litigation 
we will continue to periodically assess our cost structure and product programs to improve operational efficiencies 

table of contents stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense generally represents the amortization of deferred compensation as well as expense related to options subject to variable accounting 
we recorded approximately million of deferred compensation in and billion of deferred compensation in  primarily in connection with stock options assumed in our acquisitions 
deferred compensation primarily represents the difference between the fair value of our common stock at the measurement date of each acquisition and the exercise price of the unvested stock options assumed in the acquisition 
additional deferred compensation related to earned contingent consideration is measured and recorded at the date the contingency is met 
deferred compensation is presented as a reduction of shareholders equity and is amortized ratably over the respective vesting periods of the applicable options  generally three to five years 
approximately million and million of deferred compensation was eliminated due to employee terminations during and  respectively 
stock based compensation expense for was million or of net revenue  an increase of million or as compared with stock based compensation expense of million or of net revenue in approximately million and million of additional stock based compensation expense was classified as cost of revenue in and  respectively 
approximately million of additional stock based compensation expense resulting from an extension of the exercise period for vested stock options of certain terminated employees was classified as restructuring costs for approximately million of additional stock based compensation expense was classified as merger related costs for the significant increase in stock based compensation expense for relates primarily to stock options assumed in the four purchase transactions completed during as well as the full year impact of the eight purchase transactions completed during  all of which were accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin 
we expect to record additional stock based compensation expense in future periods as a result of the continued amortization of deferred compensation related to these purchase transactions 
in connection with our acquisition of serverworks in and our acquisitions of allayer and sibyte in  we agreed to increase the aggregate equity consideration for each acquisition if certain future internal performance goals were later achieved 
such additional consideration  if earned  will be paid in the form of additional shares of our class a common stock 
any additional consideration paid that is allocated to deferred compensation will be amortized over the remaining vesting periods of the underlying options and restricted stock assumed in the acquisitions 
in addition  outstanding options assumed in these transactions are subject to variable accounting and are revalued quarterly over their applicable vesting periods until all performance goals are satisfied or until the options are exercised  forfeited  cancelled or expire 
we recorded an additional million of deferred compensation during when certain allayer  sibyte and serverworks performance goals were met 
approximately million of this amount was expensed immediately 
at december    shares of class a common stock were reserved for future issuance if the remaining internal performance goals established in connection with our acquisitions of sibyte and serverworks are met 
if the remaining internal performance goals had been met at december   additional consideration of approximately million  based on the closing price of our class a common stock on december   would have been recorded and allocated between goodwill and deferred compensation 
the amount of actual additional consideration to be recorded will vary depending on which  if any  of the remaining internal performance goals are met and the actual market values of our class a common stock on the dates such internal performance goals are satisfied 
we recorded approximately million in stock based compensation expense in related to stock options subject to variable accounting  using the fair market value of per share based on the closing price of our class a common stock on december   in accordance with fin and fin no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans 
these charges have been and in the future will be based on the amount by which our class a common stock closing price at the end of the reporting period  or at the date of exercise  if earlier  exceeds the exercise price 
depending upon movements in the market value of our class a common stock  the variable accounting treatment of certain stock options may result in significant additional stock based compensation expense in future periods 
at december  there were  shares subject to variable accounting  of which  were vested and  were unvested 
these shares have a weighted average per share exercise price of and an average life of approximately three years 
see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
in connection with the four purchase transactions completed during and contingent consideration earned from previous acquisitions  we recorded approximately million of additional goodwill and million of purchased intangible assets in for the eight purchase transactions completed during  we recorded approximately billion of goodwill and million of purchased intangible assets in 
table of contents goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
intangible assets acquired include completed technology  customer relationships and assembled workforce 
we obtained independent appraisals or performed internal appraisals of the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired to allocate the purchase prices 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the economic lives of the respective assets  generally two to five years 
the amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets for was million or of net revenue  an increase of million or as compared with million or of net revenue in in addition  approximately million and million of amortization of purchased intangible assets has been classified as cost of revenue for and  respectively 
at december  the unamortized balance of purchased intangible assets that will be amortized in the future was million  of which the majority is expected to be amortized to expense in see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in connection with our acquisitions of allayer  sibyte and serverworks  we recorded million of additional goodwill during when certain internal performance goals were met 
we expect to record additional consideration in the future when and if any of the remaining internal performance goals are met 
any additional consideration paid will be allocated between goodwill and deferred compensation 
in june the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under these new rules  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas is immediately applicable to any acquisitions made after june  we will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets from prior acquisitions beginning in the first quarter of as of december  the unamortized balance of goodwill and other intangible assets was billion 
this balance includes assembled workforce  which will be reclassified to goodwill on january  in accordance with sfas application of the non amortization provisions of sfas is estimated to result in a decrease in amortization of goodwill of approximately million per year or per share based on weighted average shares outstanding for the year ended december  
we will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets under the new rules as of january  we have not yet determined the effect that these tests will have on our results of operations and financial position 
impairment of goodwill 
during we performed an assessment of the carrying values of intangible assets recorded in connection with our various acquisitions 
the assessment was performed in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  due to the recent significant economic slowdown and the reduction in near term demand in the technology sector and the semiconductor industry 
as a result of the assessment  we concluded that the decline in market conditions within the industry was significant and other than temporary 
based on this assessment and an independent valuation  we recorded a charge of billion to write down the value of goodwill associated with certain of our purchase transactions 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in process research and development 
ipr d totaled million for the four purchase transactions completed in  as compared to million for the eight purchase transactions completed in the amounts allocated to ipr d were determined through established valuation techniques used in the high technology industry and were expensed upon acquisition as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future uses existed 
the fair value of ipr d for each of the acquisitions was determined using the income approach 
under the income approach  the expected future cash flows from each project under development are estimated and discounted to their net present value at an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return 
significant factors considered in the calculation of the rate of return are the weighted average cost of capital and return on assets  as well as the risks inherent in the development process  including the likelihood of achieving technological success and market acceptance 
each project was analyzed to determine the unique technological innovations  the existence and reliance upon core technology  the existence of any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the complexity  cost and time to complete the remaining development 
future cash flows for each project were estimated based upon forecasted revenue and costs  taking into account product life cycles  market penetration and growth rates 

table of contents the ipr d charge includes only the fair value of ipr d performed to date 
the fair value of completed technology is included in identifiable purchased intangible assets  and the fair values of ipr d to be completed and future research and development are included in goodwill 
we believe the amounts recorded as ipr d  as well as developed technology  represent fair values and approximate the amounts an independent party would pay for these projects 
as of the closing date of each purchase transaction  development projects were in process 
although the costs to bring the products from the acquired companies to technological feasibility are not expected to have a material impact on our future results of operations or financial condition  the development of these technologies remains a significant risk due to the remaining effort required to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products  and significant competitive threats from numerous companies 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired technologies into commercially viable products consists principally of planning  designing and testing activities necessary to determine that the products can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets and could have a material and adverse impact on our business and operating results 
the following table summarizes the significant assumptions at the acquisition dates underlying the valuations for our significant purchase transactions completed in and weighted average average estimated risk estimated estimated cost to adjusted purchase percent time to complete discount ipr d transaction development projects complete complete in millions rate in millions acquisitions visiontech video compression integrated circuits year serverworks high performance systemi o integrated circuits for servers years acquisitions innovent rf integrated circuits for wireless years altima ethernet physical layer transceivers year newport integrated circuits for optical communications equipment year silicon spice communications processors year element integrated circuits used in dsl year allayer integrated circuits for wide area and ethernet switching applications years sibyte network processors years we completed all of the visiontech development projects as expected in serverworks is expected to complete two development projects during the first six months of one additional project is expected to be completed during the current weighted average percent complete for these projects is approximately  and we estimate the cost to complete these projects will be approximately million 
we completed all five of the innovent development projects by the end of an additional million over the previous estimate was required to complete these projects 
we completed three development projects of altima as expected during we reallocated the resources on the remaining project to focus on next generation semiconductor products that we believe are better aligned with future demand 
we completed all eight of the newport development projects as expected during an additional million over the previous estimate was required to complete these projects 
we completed the silicon spice development project as expected in we completed one of the element development projects during one additional project is expected to be completed during we estimate the cost to complete this project will be approximately million 
we completed one of the allayer projects as expected during we reallocated the resources on the two remaining projects to focus on next generation semiconductor products that we believe are better aligned with future demand 

table of contents we currently expect to complete one of the sibyte development projects during and another project in the current weighted average percent complete for both projects is approximately  and we estimate the cost to complete these projects will be approximately million 
except as noted above  actual results to date have been consistent  in all material respects  with our assumptions at the time of the acquisitions 
the assumptions consist primarily of expected completion dates for the in process projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  and revenue and expense projections once the products have entered the market 
shipment volumes of products from the acquired technologies are not material to our overall financial results at the present time 
it is difficult to determine the accuracy of overall revenue projections early in the technology life cycle 
failure to achieve the expected levels of revenue and net income from these products will negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time that the acquisitions were completed and may potentially result in impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets 
restructuring costs 
in the second quarter of we announced and began implementing a plan to restructure our operations in response to the then current challenging economic climate 
this restructuring plan has resulted and will result in certain business unit realignments  workforce reductions and consolidation of excess facilities 
for we recorded restructuring costs totaling million  which were classified as operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
we anticipate recording further restructuring costs in as we continue to implement this plan 
through december  the restructuring plan had resulted in termination of the employment of approximately employees across all business functions and geographic regions 
we recorded workforce reduction charges of approximately million related to severance and fringe benefits 
included in this amount is approximately million of stock based compensation expense resulting from an extension of the exercise period for vested stock options of the terminated employees 
in addition  headcount was reduced through attrition and reductions in the number of temporary and contract workers employed by us 
through december  we recorded charges of approximately million for the consolidation of excess facilities 
the charges related primarily to lease terminations and non cancelable lease costs 
we cannot assure that our restructuring program will achieve all of the expense reductions and other benefits we anticipate 
in addition  anticipated savings from reduced headcount or facility consolidations have been and may in the future be mitigated by subsequent increases to headcount and subsequent facilities additions related to our operating requirements 
litigation settlement costs 
litigation settlement costs of approximately million were incurred in no comparable litigation settlement costs were incurred in merger related costs 
in connection with the pooling of interests transactions in  merger related costs of approximately million were incurred 
no merger related costs were incurred in as there were no business combinations accounted for as poolings of interests 
merger related costs consist primarily of transaction costs  such as fees for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants and other related fees and expenses  incurred in acquisitions as well as certain restructuring costs related to the disposition of duplicative facilities and assets and the write down of unutilized assets 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  reflects interest earned on average cash and cash equivalents and investment balances  less interest accrued on our debt and capital lease obligations 
interest income  net  for was million as compared with million in the decrease for was the result of interest expense incurred on debt assumed from our serverworks acquisition and an overall decline in interest rates on our investments  partially offset by increased cash balances available to invest resulting from the cash generated by operations  cash balances assumed in acquisitions  and cash received from the exercise of employee stock options 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  primarily includes recorded gains and losses on strategic investments as well as gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and dispositions of property and equipment 
for  other expense  net  was million as compared with million in during we recorded a loss of approximately million representing an other than temporary decline in the value of our strategic investments 
provision for income taxes 
we recorded income tax benefits of approximately million in and million in  which resulted in effective tax rates of approximately for and for the federal statutory rate was for both periods 
the differences between our effective tax rates for and and the federal statutory rate resulted primarily from the effects of nondeductible ipr d  impairment of goodwill and other acquisition related expenses from the purchase transactions completed during and  as well as the effects of certain losses recorded 
table of contents without tax benefit 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december  and we provided valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in the amounts of approximately million and million  respectively  resulting in an increase in the valuation allowance in of approximately million 
approximately million of the change in the valuation allowance was recorded as income tax expense 
the remainder of the change was recorded primarily against shareholders equity as it relates primarily to the deferral of certain tax benefits from employee stock option exercises  which benefits  if and when recognized  will be recorded directly to shareholders equity 
there is no valuation allowance provided against the remainder of our deferred tax assets  as we believe it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized 
the primary bases for this conclusion are the expectation of future income from our ordinary and recurring operations and tax planning strategies  which rely on our continuing ability to realize value from our intellectual property portfolio 
the internal revenue service is examining our federal income tax returns for the years ended december  and management believes that the results of these examinations will not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations

net revenue for was billion  an increase of million or as compared with net revenue of million in net revenue for was reduced by million  which represents the fair value of the performance based warrants to purchase shares of class a common stock earned by certain customers in connection with purchase and development agreements that we assumed in prior acquisitions 
the growth in net revenue resulted mainly from increases in volume shipments of our semiconductor products for the high speed networking market  digital cable set top boxes and cable modems 
gross profit 
gross profit for was million or of net revenue  an increase of million or from gross profit of million or of net revenue in the increase in gross profit was mainly attributable to the significant increase in the volume of semiconductor product shipments 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was largely driven by volume pricing agreements and competitive pricing strategies on certain high volume products 
included in cost of revenue were approximately million and million of stock based compensation expense in and  respectively  and approximately million of amortization of purchased intangible assets in research and development expense 
research and development expense for was million or of net revenue  an increase of million or as compared with research and development expense of million or of net revenue in the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to the addition of personnel and the investment in design tools for the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense for was million or of net revenue  an increase of million or as compared with selling  general and administrative expense of million or of net revenue in the increase in absolute dollars reflected higher personnel related costs resulting from the hiring of sales and marketing personnel  senior management and administrative personnel  increased facilities expenses and legal and other professional fees 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue reflected the significant increase in net revenue during as compared with stock based compensation expense 
we recorded approximately billion and million of deferred compensation in and  respectively  primarily in connection with stock options assumed in our acquisitions 
stock based compensation expense for was million or of net revenue  an increase of million as compared with stock based compensation expense of million or of net revenue in approximately million and million of additional stock based compensation expense in and were classified as merger related costs 
in addition  approximately million and million of stock based compensation expense were classified as cost of revenue in and  respectively 
the significant increase in stock based compensation expense in relates primarily to stock options assumed in the eight purchase transactions completed during the year that were accounted for in accordance with fin see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
in connection with the eight purchase transactions completed during  we recorded approximately billion of goodwill and million of purchased intangible assets 
the amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets for was million or of net revenue 
no 
table of contents comparable amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets was incurred in in addition  approximately million of amortization of purchased intangible assets was classified as cost of revenue in in process research and development 
ipr d aggregated million for the purchase transactions completed in no amounts of ipr d were incurred in the amounts allocated to ipr d were determined through established valuation techniques used in the high technology industry and were expensed upon acquisition as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future uses existed 
litigation settlement costs 
litigation settlement costs of approximately million were incurred in no comparable litigation settlement costs were incurred in merger related costs 
merger related costs of approximately million and million were incurred in and  respectively  in connection with the pooling of interests transactions 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  for was million as compared with million in this increase was principally due to increased cash balances available to invest resulting from the cash generated by operations  cash balances assumed in acquisitions  and cash received from the exercise of employee stock options 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  primarily includes gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and the disposals of property and equipment 
for  other expense  net  was million as compared with  in provision for income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately million in and income tax expense of approximately million in  which resulted in effective tax rates of approximately for and for the federal statutory rate was for both periods 
the primary differences between our effective tax rates for and and the federal statutory rate resulted from the effects of nondeductible ipr d and acquisition related expenses from the eight purchase transactions completed during our effective tax rate on income before the effects of these items  and before the effects of payroll tax expenses relating to certain stock option exercises  was for and for the primary reasons for our decreased effective tax rate on income before such items for compared to were benefits from increased research and development credits and beneficial tax rate differentials on foreign earnings 
at december  and we provided a valuation allowance of million against a portion of certain acquired net operating losses  due to uncertainty regarding their future realization 
there was no valuation allowance provided against the remainder of our deferred tax assets  as we believed it was more likely than not that these assets would be realized 
the primary basis for this conclusion was the expectation of future income from our ordinary and recurring operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june the fasb issued sfas and sfas effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under these new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
sfas is immediately applicable to any acquisitions made after june  we will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets from prior acquisitions beginning in the first quarter of application of the non amortization provisions of sfas is estimated to result in a decrease in amortization of goodwill of approximately million per year or per share based on weighted average shares outstanding for the year ended december  
we will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets under the new rules during we have not yet determined the effect these tests will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
in october the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which supercedes prior accounting standards concerning the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or the disposition of long lived assets for the disposition of a segment of a business 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we expect to adopt sfas as of january  and have not yet determined the effect  if any  the adoption of sfas will have on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources since our inception we have financed our operations through a combination of sales of equity securities  cash generated by operations and cash assumed in acquisitions 
at december  we had million in working capital  million in cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities and million in long term marketable securities 
marketable securities are defined as income yielding securities that can be readily converted into cash 
at december  we had million in working capital  million in cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities  and million in long term marketable securities 
our working capital declined in due primarily to our assumption of approximately million in net current liabilities in the acquisitions made during the year 
in addition  we had million in long term marketable securities at the end of that were included in current assets at the end of and we expended approximately million on additions to property and equipment and strategic investments 
cash and cash equivalents decreased from million at december  to million at december  as investing activities more than offset the cash provided by operating and financing activities 
during operating activities provided million in cash 
although we had a net loss of billion in  such amount included non cash items aggregating billion resulting from depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense  amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets  impairment of goodwill  ipr d  restructuring charges  deferred taxes and loss on strategic investments 
in addition to the impact of non cash items  our operating activities also reflected decreases in accounts receivable and inventory  offset in part by decreases in other accrued liabilities 
operating activities provided cash in the amount of million in this was primarily the result of the net loss of million being more than offset by the impact of net non cash charges aggregating million 
accounts receivable decreased million to million during the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to lower billings at the end of as compared to inventories decreased million to million during the reduction in inventory generally reflects the close management of our inventory levels during the recent economic slowdown  and the increased use of drop shipments from our manufacturing subcontractors directly to our customers 
in the future  we may be required to maintain higher levels of accounts receivable and inventory to support increased sales 
this may result in our operating activities using cash  in contrast to historically providing cash 
investing activities used cash in the amount of million in  primarily as a result of million of net purchases of marketable securities  the purchase of million of capital equipment to support our operations and the purchase of million of strategic investments  offset in part by million of net cash acquired in purchase transactions 
in our investing activities provided million in cash  as a result of million in proceeds from the net sales of marketable securities and million in net cash acquired in purchase transactions  offset in part by million in purchases of capital equipment and the purchase of million in strategic investments 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  which was primarily the result of a million bank credit facility secured to replace the serverworks credit facility that was paid off in  million in net proceeds received from issuances of common stock upon exercises of stock options and million in net proceeds from the exercise of performance based warrants earned by customers  partially offset by million in payments on debt obligations primarily of acquired companies 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  primarily from million in net proceeds from issuances of common stock upon exercises of stock options and net proceeds of million from the exercise of performance based warrants earned by customers  partially offset by million in net payments on debt obligations of acquired companies 
due to the significant decline in our stock price  we received fewer proceeds from the exercise of stock options in than we did in  as significantly fewer options  with lower exercise prices  were exercised 
in the future we may not generate as much cash from the exercise of stock options as we have in the past 

table of contents the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments payment obligations by year in thousands there after total credit facility note payable capital leases operating leases purchase commitments total in addition  we have guaranteed an aggregate of million in loans provided by a financial institution to certain of our employees 
at the time of its acquisition by us  serverworks had an existing bank credit facility of up to million  of which million was outstanding on the date of acquisition 
to receive more favorable terms and conditions  on december  that credit facility was paid in full and terminated 
on december  we entered into a replacement financing arrangement for a bank credit facility of up to million 
we may choose the rate at which the credit facility bears interest at the rate of either a the higher of i plus the federal reserve rate and ii the bank of america prime rate or b libor plus selected in one  two or three month periods 
interest is payable at either the selected interest period or quarterly 
at december  the interest rate for the credit facility was 
we must pay a commitment fee of on any unused balance of the credit facility 
at december   million was outstanding under the credit facility 
the credit facility is due and payable december  at the time of its acquisition by us  serverworks had a million non interest bearing obligation to a third party 
that obligation was paid in april our debt also includes a note payable to a significant customer in the amount of million that bears interest at a rate of libor plus per year  adjusted quarterly  and is due in december at december  the interest rate for the note was 
the note becomes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain events 
the customer has asserted that the entire principal amount of the note and all interest accrued thereon are currently due and payable and has filed a lawsuit to collect the obligation  we dispute that assertion and are vigorously defending the lawsuit 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
capitalized lease obligations for equipment are payable in varying monthly installments at rates from to 
we lease our facilities and certain engineering design tools and information systems equipment under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through we had outstanding capital commitments totaling approximately million as of december   primarily for the purchase of engineering design tools  computer hardware and information systems infrastructure 
during we spent approximately million on capital equipment to support our operations 
we expect that we will continue to spend substantial amounts during to purchase additional engineering design tools  computer hardware  test equipment  information systems and leasehold improvements  to support our operations and as we integrate and upgrade the capital equipment and facilities of acquired companies 
we may finance these purchases from our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  on hand  borrowings  debt and equity offerings  or a combination of any of these means 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements and commitments for at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities beyond the next months or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
we could raise such funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money from financial institutions 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on terms that would be favorable to our shareholders and us  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders 
table of contents would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
although we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next months  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
we anticipate that the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including the overall levels of sales of our products and gross profit margins  the market acceptance of our products  the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our new products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace  volume price discounts  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and product and technology roadmaps  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  capital improvements to new and existing facilities  technological advances  our competitors response to our products  our relationships with suppliers and customers  and general economic conditions and specific conditions in the semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets  including the effects of the current economic slowdown and related uncertainties 
in addition  we may require additional capital to accommodate planned future growth  hiring  infrastructure and facility needs or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
risk factors before deciding to invest in our company or to maintain or increase your investment  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec  including our subsequent reports on forms q and k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business 
if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occur with material adverse effects on broadcom  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price for our class a common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
we are exposed to the risks associated with the recent worldwide economic slowdown and related uncertainties 
slower economic activity  concerns about inflation  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns in the telecommunications and related industries  and recent international conflicts and terrorist and military activity have resulted in a downturn in worldwide economic conditions  and particularly in the united states 
as a result of these unfavorable economic conditions  in the first half of we experienced a significant slowdown in customer orders  an increase in the number of cancellations and reschedulings of backlog and higher overhead costs as a percentage of our reduced net revenue 
although the volume of orders placed by customers increased  and our backlog and overhead costs  as a percentage of net revenue  improved during the second half of  concerns remain regarding the timing  strength and duration of economic recovery in the semiconductor industry and broadband communications and internet infrastructure markets 
in addition  recent political and social turmoil related to international conflicts and terrorist acts can be expected to place further pressure on economic conditions in the us and worldwide 
these political  social and economic conditions make it extremely difficult for our customers  our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
if such conditions continue or worsen  our business  financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents our operating results may fluctuate significantly due to the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry 
any such variations could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
we operate in the semiconductor industry  which is cyclical and subject to rapid technological change 
from time to time  the semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns such as the current one 
these downturns are characterized by diminished product demand  excess customer inventories  accelerated erosion of prices and excess production capacity 
the current downturn and future downturns in the semiconductor industry may be severe and prolonged 
future downturns in the semiconductor industry  or any failure of this industry or the broadband communications markets to fully recover from the recent downturn  could seriously impact our revenue and harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
this industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints  which may affect our ability to ship products in future periods 
accordingly  our quarterly results may vary significantly as a result of the general conditions in the semiconductor industry  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly 
as a result  we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly net revenue and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price may decline 
fluctuations in our operating results may be due to a number of factors  including the following economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets  including the effects of the current significant economic slowdown  international conflicts and acts of terrorism and the impact of adverse economic  market and political conditions worldwide  the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders  the gain or loss of a key customer  changes in our product or customer mix  the volume of our product sales and pricing concessions on volume sales  the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products  the effectiveness of our expense and product cost control and reduction efforts  the rate of adoption and acceptance of new industry standards in our target markets  our ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a timely manner  the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt broadcom technologies and products in our target markets  the timing of customer industry qualification and certification of our products and the risks of non qualification or non certification  the effects of new and emerging technologies  the various risks inherent in our acquisitions of technologies and businesses  our ability to retain and hire key executives  technical personnel and other employees in the numbers  with the capabilities and at the compensation levels that we need to implement our business and product plans  patent and other intellectual property disputes  customer indemnification claims and other types of litigation risks  fluctuations in the manufacturing yields of our third party semiconductor foundries and other problems or delays in the fabrication  assembly  testing or delivery of our products  problems or delays that we may face in shifting our products to smaller geometry process technologies and in achieving higher levels of design integration  
table of contents the availability and pricing of third party semiconductor foundry and assembly and test capacity and raw materials  the risks and challenges of producing products with new suppliers and at new fabrication and assembly facilities  the risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations  the quality of our products and any remediation costs  the effects of natural disasters and other events beyond our control  and the level of orders received that we can ship in a fiscal quarter 
we expect to continue to increase our operating expenses in the future 
a large portion of our operating expenses  including rent  salaries and capital lease expenditures  is fixed and difficult to reduce or change 
accordingly  if our revenue does not meet our expectations  we probably would not be able to adjust our expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall in revenue 
in that event  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
due to all of the foregoing factors  and the other risks discussed in this report  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of future performance 
because we depend on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenue  the loss of a key customer could seriously impact our revenue and harm our business 
in addition  if we are unable to continue to sell existing and new products to our key customers in significant quantities or to attract new significant customers  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
we have derived a substantial portion of our revenue in the past from sales to a relatively small number of customers 
as a result  the loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
sales to motorola  including sales to its manufacturing subcontractors  accounted for approximately of our net revenue in sales to our five largest customers  including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors  decreased to of our net revenue in compared to of our net revenue in we expect that our key customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue in and in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  our future operating results will continue to depend on the success of our largest customers and on our ability to sell existing and new products to these customers in significant quantities 
we may not be able to maintain or increase sales to certain of our key customers for a variety of reasons  including the following most of our customers can stop incorporating our products into their own products with limited notice to us and suffer little or no penalty 
our agreements with our customers typically do not require them to purchase a minimum amount of our products 
many of our customers have pre existing relationships with our current or potential competitors that may affect their decisions to purchase our products 
our customers face intense competition from other manufacturers that do not use our products 
some of our customers offer or may offer products that compete with our products 
our longstanding relationships with some of our larger customers may also deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from buying our products 
in addition  to attract new customers or retain existing customers  we may offer certain customers favorable prices on our products 
if these prices are lower than the prices paid by our existing customers  we would have to offer the same lower prices to certain of our customers who have contractual most favored nation pricing arrangements 
in that event  our average selling prices and gross margins would decline 
the loss of a key customer  a reduction in our sales to any key customer or our inability to attract new significant customers could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents because we are subject to order and shipment uncertainties  any significant order cancellations or deferrals could adversely affect our operating results 
we typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders that customers can generally cancel or defer on short notice without incurring a significant penalty 
any significant cancellations or deferrals in the future could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  cancellations or deferrals could cause us to hold excess inventory  which could reduce our profit margins  increase product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to a customer 
if a customer refuses to accept shipped products or does not timely pay for these products  we could incur significant charges against our income  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
we face intense competition in the broadband communications markets and semiconductor industry  which could reduce our market share in existing markets and affect our entry into new markets 
the broadband communications markets and semiconductor industry are intensely competitive 
we expect competition to continue to increase as industry standards become well known and as other competitors enter our target markets 
we currently compete with a number of major domestic and international suppliers of integrated circuits and related applications in the markets for digital cable set top boxes  cable modems  high speed local  metropolitan and wide area and optical networks  home networking  voip  carrier access  residential broadband gateways  direct broadcast satellite and terrestrial digital broadcast  digital subscriber lines  wireless communications  i o server solutions and network processing 
we also compete with suppliers of system level and motherboard level solutions incorporating integrated circuits that are proprietary or sourced from manufacturers other than broadcom 
this competition has resulted and may continue to result in declining average selling prices for some of our products 
in all of our target markets  we also may face competition from newly established competitors  suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies  and customers who choose to develop their own silicon solutions 
we also expect to encounter further consolidation in the markets in which we compete 
many of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key markets  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than we do 
these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they may also be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers  resellers or other third parties 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
existing or new competitors may also develop technologies in the future that more effectively address our markets with products that offer enhanced features  lower power requirements or lower cost 
increased competition has in the past and is likely to continue to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully or that competitive pressures will not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must keep pace with rapid technological changes in the semiconductor industry and broadband communications markets to remain competitive 
our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards 
we will also need to continue to develop and introduce new and enhanced products to meet our customers changing demands 
substantially all of our product revenue in recent quarters has been derived from sales of products for the cable modem  digital cable set top box  high speed office network and network server markets 
these markets are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles and increasing demand for higher levels of integration and smaller process geometries 
in addition  these markets continue to undergo rapid growth and consolidation 
a significant slowdown in any of these or other broadband communications markets could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success will also depend on the ability of our customers to develop new products and enhance existing products for the broadband communications markets and to introduce and promote those products successfully 
the broadband communications markets may not continue to develop to the extent or in the time periods that we anticipate 
if new markets do not develop as we anticipate  or if our products do not gain widespread acceptance in these markets  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents if we do not anticipate and adapt to evolving industry standards in the semiconductor industry and broadband communications markets  our products could become obsolete and we could lose market share 
products for broadband communications applications generally are based on industry standards that are continually evolving 
if new industry standards emerge  our products or our customers products could become unmarketable or obsolete 
we may also have to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these new standards 
our past sales and profitability have resulted  to a large extent  from our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products incorporating the new standards 
our ability to adapt to these changes and to anticipate future standards  and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those standards  will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and prospects for growth 
we have in the past invested substantial resources in emerging technologies that did not achieve the market acceptance that we had expected 
our inability to anticipate the evolving standards in the semiconductor industry and  in particular the broadband communications markets  or to develop and introduce new products successfully into these markets could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner or to achieve market acceptance of our new products  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our future success will depend on our ability to develop new silicon solutions for existing and new markets  introduce these products in a cost effective and timely manner and convince leading equipment manufacturers to select these products for design into their own new products 
our quarterly results in the past have been  and are expected in the future to continue to be  dependent on the introduction of a relatively small number of new products and the timely completion and delivery of those products to customers 
the development of new silicon devices is highly complex  and from time to time we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and lower than anticipated manufacturing yields in the early production of such products 
our ability to develop and deliver new products successfully will depend on various factors  including our ability to accurately predict market requirements and evolving industry standards  accurately define new products  timely complete and introduce new product designs  timely qualify and obtain industry interoperability certification of our products and the products of our customers into which our products will be incorporated  obtain sufficient foundry capacity  achieve high manufacturing yields  shift our products to smaller geometry process technologies to achieve lower cost and higher levels of design integration  and gain market acceptance of our products and our customers products 
if we are not able to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
our new products generally are incorporated into our customers products at the design stage 
we often incur significant expenditures on the development of a new product without any assurance that an equipment manufacturer will select our product for design into its own product 
the value of our products largely depends on the commercial success of our customers products and on the extent to which those products accommodate components manufactured by our competitors 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to achieve design wins or that equipment that incorporates our products will ever be commercially successful 
our products typically have lengthy sales cycles 
a customer may decide to cancel or change its product plans  which could cause us to lose anticipated sales 
in addition  our average product cycles tend to be short and  as a result  we may hold excess or obsolete inventory that could adversely affect our operating results 
after we have developed and delivered a product to a customer  the customer will usually test and evaluate our product prior to designing its own equipment to incorporate our product 
our customer may need three to six months or longer to test  evaluate and adopt our product and an additional three to nine months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our product 
moreover  in light of the recent significant economic slowdown in the technology sector  it may take significantly longer than three to nine months before customers commence volume production of 
table of contents equipment incorporating some of our products 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience significant delays from the time we increase our operating expenses and make investments in inventory until the time that we generate revenue from these products 
it is possible that we may never generate any revenue from these products after incurring such expenditures 
even if a customer selects our product to incorporate into its equipment  we have no assurances that the customer will ultimately market and sell its equipment or that such efforts by our customer will be successful 
the delays inherent in our lengthy sales cycle increase the risk that a customer will decide to cancel or change its product plans 
such a cancellation or change in plans by a customer could cause us to lose sales that we had anticipated 
in addition  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if a significant customer curtails  reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle or chooses not to release equipment that contains our products 
while our sales cycles are typically long  our average product life cycles tend to be short as a result of the rapidly changing technology environment in which we operate 
as a result  the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not generate material revenue for us  and from time to time  we may need to write off excess and obsolete inventory 
if we incur significant marketing and inventory expenses in the future that we are not able to recover  and we are not able to compensate for those expenses  our operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions and we still have higher cost products in inventory  our operating results would be harmed 
our acquisition strategy may require us to undertake significant capital infusions  be dilutive to our existing shareholders  result in unanticipated accounting charges or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations  and result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of acquired companies or businesses 
a key element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses  products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings  expand our market coverage  increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities 
between january  and december   we acquired companies  including four acquisitions that were completed in we plan to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities in the future 
acquisitions may require significant capital infusions  typically entail many risks and could result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of acquired companies 
we have in the past and may in the future experience delays in the timing and successful completion of the acquired company s technologies and product development through volume production  unanticipated costs and expenditures  changing relationships with customers  suppliers and strategic partners  or contractual  intellectual property or employment issues 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
the acquisition of another company or its products and technologies may also require us to enter into a geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience 
these challenges could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  harm our reputation and increase our expenses 
in addition  acquisitions may materially and adversely affect our results of operations because they may require large one time charges or could result in increased debt or contingent liabilities  adverse tax consequences  substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges  or the amortization of amounts related to deferred compensation and purchased intangible assets 
in connection with our purchase acquisitions to date  we recorded goodwill in the aggregate amount of approximately billion 
the portion of such goodwill attributable to each acquisition generally has been amortized over a month period from the date that such acquisition closed 
in accordance with sfas we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of billion in the three months ended september  to write down the value of goodwill associated with certain of our purchase transactions 
beginning in the first quarter of  goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with sfas and sfas in addition  in connection with these acquisitions we incurred deferred compensation charges in the aggregate amount of approximately billion  which will be amortized over the period of time for which the relevant options or restricted stock may continue to vest 
we expect to record additional goodwill and deferred compensation charges in connection with future acquisitions and may record additional goodwill and deferred compensation charges with respect to prior acquisitions that involve as yet unearned contingent consideration 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
any of these events could cause the price of our class a common stock to decline 
acquisitions made entirely or partially for cash may reduce our cash reserves 
furthermore  if we issue equity or convertible debt securities in connection with an acquisition  as in the case of our recent acquisitions  the issuance may be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we may issue could have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our class a or class b common stock 
for example  as a consequence of the pooling of 
table of contents interests rules  the securities issued in nine of the completed acquisitions described above were shares of class b common stock  which have voting rights superior to our publicly traded class a common stock 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any pending or future acquisitions or that we will realize the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions 
in the future  we may not be able to find other suitable acquisition opportunities that are available at attractive valuations  if at all 
even if we do find suitable acquisition opportunities  we may not be able to consummate the acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms  as the recent decline in the price of our class a common stock may make it significantly more difficult and expensive to initiate or consummate additional acquisitions 
moreover  it may be difficult for us to successfully integrate any acquired businesses  products  technologies or personnel  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to retain key technical and senior management personnel and attract additional key employees  which could seriously harm our business 
our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel  in particular  our co founders  president and chief executive officer  dr 
henry t 
nicholas iii  and vice president of research development and chief technical officer  dr 
henry samueli 
we do not have employment agreements with these executives or any other key employees that govern the length of their service 
the loss of the services of dr 
nicholas or dr 
samueli  or certain other key employees  would likely materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  particularly senior managers  digital circuit designers  mixed signal circuit designers and systems applications engineers 
competition for these employees is intense and the recent decline in the price of our class a common stock may make it more difficult to attract and retain such key employees  all of whom have been granted stock options 
in june we completed a stock option exchange offering for the purpose of reincentivizing and improving our ability to retain key employees 
however  we cannot be certain that the stock option exchange program will result in increased retention of such employees 
our inability to attract and retain additional key employees could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success depends in significant part on strategic relationships with certain of our customers 
if we cannot maintain these relationships or if these customers develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor s solutions instead of buying our products  our operating results would be adversely affected 
in the past  we have relied in significant part on our strategic relationships with certain customers who are technology leaders in our target markets 
we intend to pursue and continue to form these strategic relationships in the future but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
these relationships often require us to develop new products that may involve significant technological challenges 
our partners frequently place considerable pressure on us to meet their tight development schedules 
accordingly  we may have to devote a substantial amount of our limited resources to our strategic relationships  which could detract from or delay our completion of other important development projects 
delays in development could impair our relationships with our strategic partners and negatively impact sales of the products under development 
moreover  it is possible that our customers may develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor s solution for products that they currently buy from us 
if that happens  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights  which could harm our competitive position 
our success and future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we primarily rely on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies and processes 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes  it is possible that certain of our competitors or other parties may obtain  use or disclose our technologies and processes 
we currently hold issued united states patents and have filed over additional united states patent applications 
we cannot assure that any additional patents will be issued 
even if a new patent is issued  the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  any of our existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
moreover  any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful protection 
if our patents do not adequately protect our technology  our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours 
our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
moreover  
table of contents because we have participated in developing various industry standards  we may be required to license some of our technology and patents to others  including competitors  who develop products based on the adopted standards 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and strategic partners 
we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these efforts  parties may attempt to copy  disclose  obtain or use our products  services or technology without our authorization 
as a result  our technologies and processes may be misappropriated  particularly in foreign countries where laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
in addition  some of our customers have entered into agreements with us that grant them the right to use our proprietary technology if we ever fail to fulfill our obligations  including product supply obligations  under those agreements  and if we do not correct this failure within a specified time period 
moreover  we often incorporate the intellectual property of our strategic customers into our own designs  and have certain obligations not to use or disclose their intellectual property without their authorization 
we cannot assure you that our efforts to prevent the misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers will succeed 
we are currently engaged in litigation  and in the future we may have to engage in additional litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
this litigation may be very expensive and time consuming  divert management s attention and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
infringement or other claims against us could adversely affect our ability to market our products  require us to redesign our products or seek licenses from third parties and seriously harm our operating results 
companies in the semiconductor industry often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights 
from time to time  we have received  and may continue to receive in the future  notices that claim we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused other parties proprietary rights 
moreover  in the past we have been engaged and currently we are engaged in litigation with parties who claim that we have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets 
although we are defending the pending litigation vigorously  it is possible that we will not prevail in pending or future lawsuits 
in addition  we may be sued in the future by other parties who claim that we have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets  or who may seek to invalidate one of our patents 
any of these claims may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  in a patent or trade secret action  a court could issue a preliminary or permanent injunction that would require us to withdraw or recall certain products from the market or redesign certain products offered for sale or under development 
in addition  we may be liable for damages for past infringement and royalties for future use of the technology 
we may also have to indemnify certain customers and strategic partners under our agreements with such parties if a third party alleges or if a court finds that we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused another party s proprietary rights 
even if claims against us are not valid or successfully asserted  these claims could result in significant costs and a diversion of management and personnel resources to defend 
in that event  our business  financial condition and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected 
if any claims or actions are asserted against us  we may seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights 
however  we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we depend on five independent foundry subcontractors to manufacture substantially all of our current products  and any failure to obtain sufficient foundry capacity could materially and adversely affect our business 
we do not own or operate a fabrication facility 
five outside foundry subcontractors located in asia manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor devices in current production 
in september two of the foundries principal facilities were affected by a significant earthquake in taiwan 
as a consequence of this earthquake  they suffered power outages and equipment damage that impaired their wafer deliveries which  together with strong demand  resulted in wafer shortages and higher wafer pricing industrywide 
if any of our foundries suffers any damage to its facilities  experiences power outages  encounters financial difficulties or in the event of any other disruption of foundry capacity  we may not be able to qualify an alternative foundry in a timely manner 
even our current foundries would need to have new manufacturing processes qualified if there is a disruption in an existing process 
if we choose to use a new foundry or process  it would typically take us several months to qualify the new foundry or process before we can begin shipping products from it 
if we cannot accomplish this qualification in a timely manner  we may still experience a significant interruption in supply of the affected products 

table of contents because we rely on outside foundries with limited capacity  we face several significant risks  including a lack of ensured wafer supply and potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices  limited control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and control  manufacturing yields and production costs  and the unavailability of or potential delays in obtaining access to key process technologies 
in addition  the manufacture of integrated circuits is a highly complex and technologically demanding process 
although we work closely with our foundries to minimize the likelihood of reduced manufacturing yields  our foundries have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields 
this often occurs during the production of new products or the installation and start up of new process technologies 
the ability of each foundry to provide us with semiconductor devices is limited by its available capacity and existing obligations 
although we have entered into contractual commitments to supply specified levels of products to certain of our customers  we do not have a long term volume purchase agreement or a guaranteed level of production capacity with any of our foundries 
foundry capacity may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices 
availability of foundry capacity has in the recent past been reduced due to strong demand 
we place our orders on the basis of our customers purchase orders  and the foundries can allocate capacity to the production of other companies products and reduce deliveries to us on short notice 
it is possible that foundry customers that are larger and better financed than we are  or that have long term agreements with our four main foundries  may induce our foundries to reallocate capacity to them 
such a reallocation could impair our ability to secure the supply of components that we need 
although we primarily use four independent foundries  most of our components are not manufactured at more than one foundry at any given time  and our products typically are designed to be manufactured on a specific process at only one of these foundries 
accordingly  if one of our foundries is unable to provide us with components as needed  we could experience significant delays in securing sufficient supplies of those components 
any of these delays would likely materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure that any of our existing or new foundries would be able to produce integrated circuits with acceptable manufacturing yields 
furthermore  our foundries may not be able to deliver enough semiconductor devices to us on a timely basis  or at reasonable prices 
certain of our acquired companies have established relationships with foundries other than our five main foundries  and we are using these other foundries to produce the initial products of these acquired companies 
we may utilize such foundries for other products in the future 
in using new foundries  we will be subject to all of the same risks described in the foregoing paragraphs with respect to our current foundries 
we may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration and that may result in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
in order to remain competitive  we expect to continue to transition our products to increasingly smaller line width geometries 
this transition will require us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products and redesign certain products 
we periodically evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies to reduce our costs  and we have designed certain products to be manufactured in 
micron  
micron  
micron and 
micron geometry processes 
in the past  we have experienced some difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes 
these difficulties resulted in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
we may face similar difficulties  delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes 
we are dependent on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully 
we cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our relationships with our foundries 
if our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
as smaller geometry processes become more prevalent  we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality  as well as customer and third party intellectual property  into our products 
however  we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis  or at all 

table of contents the loss of any of the third party subcontractors that assemble and test substantially all of our current products could disrupt our shipments  harm our customer relationships and adversely affect our net sales 
we do not own or operate an assembly or test facility 
five third party subcontractors located in asia assemble and test substantially all of our current products 
because we rely on third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products  we cannot directly control our product delivery schedules and quality assurance and control 
this lack of control has in the past resulted  and could in the future result  in product shortages or quality assurance problems that could increase our manufacturing  assembly or testing costs 
we do not have long term agreements with any of these subcontractors and typically procure services from these suppliers on a per order basis 
if any of these subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties  suffers any damage to its facilities  experiences power outages or in the event of any other disruption of assembly and testing capacity  we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner 
due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assemblers and testers  we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assemblers or testers for our components 
any problems that we may encounter with the delivery  quality or cost of our products could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are continuing to develop relationships with additional third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products 
in using these new subcontractors  we will be subject to all of the same risks described in the foregoing paragraph 
the complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses and in undetected defects or bugs  which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products and damage our reputation with current or prospective customers 
highly complex products such as the products that we offer frequently contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  these defects and bugs 
if any of our products contain defects or bugs  or have reliability  quality or compatibility problems  our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products  which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers 
in addition  these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales to our customers 
to alleviate these problems  we may have to invest significant capital and other resources 
although our products are tested by our suppliers  our customers and ourselves  it is possible that our new products will contain defects or bugs 
if any of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product  we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall  repair or replacement costs 
these problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others 
in addition  these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts 
moreover  we would likely lose  or experience a delay in  market acceptance of the affected product or products  and we could lose credibility with our current and prospective customers 
we may be unable to manage future growth  which could strain our managerial  operational and financial resources  and materially and adversely affect our business 
during the past few years  we significantly increased the scope of our operations and expanded our workforce  expanding from  employees as of december  to  employees as of december   including contract and temporary employees and employees who joined us as the result of acquisitions 
this growth has placed  and any future growth is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our management personnel  systems and resources 
we anticipate that we will need to implement a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems  procedures and controls  and other internal management systems 
we also will need to continue to expand  train  manage and motivate our workforce 
all of these endeavors will require substantial management effort 
we will likely need to expand our facilities or relocate some or all of our employees or operations from time to time to support our growth 
these relocations could result in temporary disruptions of our operations or a diversion of management s attention and resources 
if we are unable to effectively manage expanding operations  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
as our international business expands  our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected as a result of legal  business  political and economic risks specific to our international operations 
we currently obtain substantially all of our manufacturing  assembly and testing services from suppliers located outside of the united states 
in addition  approximately of our net revenue for the year ended december  was derived from sales to independent customers outside the united states 
we also frequently ship products to our domestic 
table of contents customers international manufacturing divisions and subcontractors 
in we established an international distribution center in singapore and a design center in the netherlands 
furthermore  as a result of various acquisitions  we also currently undertake design and development activities in india  canada  taiwan  the united kingdom  belgium and israel 
we intend to continue to expand our international business activities and to open other design and operational centers abroad 
the recent terrorist attacks in the united states and abroad and resultant heightened security may adversely impact our international sales and could make our international operations more expensive 
international operations are subject to many inherent risks  including political  social and economic instability  nationalization of business and blocking of cash flows  acts of terrorism and international conflicts  trade restrictions  the imposition of governmental controls and restrictions  exposure to different legal standards  particularly with respect to intellectual property  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  import and export license requirements and restrictions of the united states and each other country in which we operate  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  foreign technical standards  changes in tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
moreover  the seasonality of international sales and economic conditions in our primary overseas markets may negatively impact the demand for our products abroad 
all of our international sales to date have been denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets or require us to assume the risk of denominating certain sales in foreign currencies 
any one or more of the foregoing factors could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations or require us to modify our current business practices significantly 
we anticipate that these factors will impact our business to a greater degree as we further expand our international business activities 
we may seek to raise additional capital in the future through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities or by borrowing money  and additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements and commitments for at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities beyond the next year or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
we could raise these funds by selling more equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations significantly or to obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies or potential markets 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our class a or class b common stock 

table of contents our california facilities and the facilities of two of the four independent foundries upon which we rely to manufacture substantially all of our current products are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 
our california facilities  including our principal executive offices  are located near major earthquake fault lines 
if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of our facilities is located  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  two of the five outside foundries upon which we rely to manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor devices  are located in taiwan  a country that recently experienced a significant earthquake and could be subject to additional earthquakes 
any earthquake or other natural disaster in taiwan could materially disrupt our foundries production capabilities and could result in our experiencing a significant delay in delivery  or substantial shortage  of wafers and possibly in higher wafer prices 
disruptions in energy supplies could negatively affect our results of operations 
early in california experienced prolonged energy alerts and blackouts caused by disruption in energy supplies 
as a consequence  california continues to experience substantially increased costs of electricity and natural gas 
we are unsure whether these alerts and blackouts will reoccur or how severe they may become in the future 
several of our facilities  including our principal executive offices  are located  and we conduct research  development and engineering activities  in california 
many of our customers are also headquartered or have substantial operations in california 
if we  or any of our major customers located in california  experience a sustained disruption in energy supplies  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
changes in current or future laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations by the fcc  other federal or state agencies or foreign governments could impede the sale of our products or otherwise harm our business 
the federal communications commission has broad jurisdiction over each of our target markets 
although current fcc regulations and the laws and regulations of other federal or state agencies are not directly applicable to our products  they do apply to much of the equipment into which our products are incorporated 
as a result  the effects of regulation on our customers or the industries in which they operate may  in turn  materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
fcc regulatory policies that affect the ability of cable operators or telephone companies to offer certain services or other aspects of their business may impede the sale of our products 
for example  in the past we have experienced delays when products incorporating our chips failed to comply with fcc emissions specifications 
we and our customers may also be subject to regulation by countries other than the united states 
foreign governments may impose tariffs  duties and other import restrictions on components that we obtain from non domestic suppliers and may impose export restrictions on products that we sell internationally 
these tariffs  duties or restrictions could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the united states or elsewhere could also materially and adversely affect our business 
various export licensing requirements could materially and adversely affect our business or require us to significantly modify our current business practices 
various government export regulations apply to the encryption or other features contained in some of our products 
we have applied for and received several export licenses under these regulations  but we cannot assure you that we will obtain any licenses for which we have currently applied or any licenses that we may apply for in the future 
if we do not receive the required licenses  we may be unable to manufacture the affected products at our foreign foundries or to ship these products to certain customers located outside of the united states 
certain of our directors  executive officers and their affiliates can control the outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders  and accordingly we will not be able to engage in certain transactions without their approval 
as of march  our directors and executive officers beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock and of the total voting control held by our shareholders 
in particular  as of march  our two founders  dr 
henry t 
nicholas iii and dr 
henry samueli  beneficially owned a total of approximately of our outstanding common stock and of the total voting control held by our shareholders 
accordingly  these shareholders currently have enough voting power to control the outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders 
these matters include the election of a majority of our board of directors  the issuance of additional shares of class b common 
table of contents stock  and the approval of most significant corporate transactions  including a merger  consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets 
in addition  these persons currently control the management of our business 
because of their significant voting stock ownership  we will not be able to engage in certain transactions without the approval of these shareholders 
these transactions include proxy contests  mergers  tender offers  open market purchase programs or other purchases of our class a common stock that could give our shareholders the opportunity to receive a higher price for their shares than the prevailing market price at the time of such purchases 
our stock price is highly volatile 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for them 
the market price of our class a common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
since august  our class a common stock has traded at prices as low as and as high as per share 
these fluctuations have occurred and may continue to occur in response to various factors  many of which we cannot control  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors  customers or us  general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets  international conflicts and acts of terrorism  changes in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by analysts  changes in investor perceptions  or changes in expectations relating to our products  plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers 
in addition  the market prices of securities of internet related  semiconductor and other high technology companies have been especially volatile 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been the subject of securities class action litigation  and as noted in note of notes to consolidated financial statements we have recently been sued in several purported securities class action lawsuits  which have been consolidated into a single action 
we and our directors and officers have also been sued in purported shareholder derivative actions and other securities litigation 
although we believe that those lawsuits are without merit  an adverse determination could have a very significant effect on our business and results of operations  and could materially affect the price of our stock 
moreover  regardless of the ultimate result  it is likely that the lawsuits will divert management s attention and resources from other matters  which could also adversely affect the price of our stock 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain anti takeover provisions that could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may prevent or discourage a third party from acquiring us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders 
in addition  we have in the past issued and may in the future issue shares of class b common stock in connection with certain acquisitions  upon exercise of certain stock options  and for other purposes 
class b shares have superior voting rights entitling the holder to ten votes for each share held on matters that we submit to a shareholder vote as compared with one vote per share in the case of our class a common stock 
our board of directors also has the authority to fix the rights and preferences of shares of our preferred stock and to issue such shares without a shareholder vote 
it is possible that the provisions in our charter documents  the exercise of supervoting rights by holders of our class b common stock  our officers ownership of a majority of the class b common stock and the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock or additional shares of class b common stock may prevent parties from acquiring us 
in addition  these factors may discourage third parties from bidding for our class a common stock at a premium over the market price for this stock 
finally  these factors may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock  and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our non trading investment portfolio 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines  the guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
debt securities are generally classified as held to maturity and are stated at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity 
our investment policy for held to maturity investments requires that all investments mature in three years or less  with a weighted average maturity of no longer than one year 
primarily  these investments are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
equity securities are generally classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
included in our portfolio are equity investments in three publicly traded companies 
as a result of recent market price volatility  we recorded a million loss in related to these investments 
as of december  the fair value of these publicly traded equity investments was million 
we have also invested in several privately held companies  many of which can still be considered to be in the start up or development stage  or in funds that invest in such companies 
we make investments in key business partners and other industry participants to establish important strategic relationships  expand existing relationships and achieve a return on our investment 
these investments are inherently risky  as the markets for the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
as such  we could lose our entire investment in these companies 
we recorded a million loss in related to these privately held investments 
as of december  the fair value of these investments was million 
our debt currently consists of a financing arrangement for a bank credit facility of up to million  a note payable in the amount of million and capital leases in the amount of million 
with respect to the credit facility  we may choose the rate at which the credit facility bears interest at the rate of either a the higher of i plus the federal reserve rate and ii the bank of america prime rate or b libor plus selected in one  two or three month periods 
interest is payable at either the selected interest period or quarterly 
at december   the interest rate for the credit facility was 
we must pay a commitment fee of on any unused balance of the credit facility 
at december  million was outstanding under the credit facility 
the credit facility is due and payable december  the note payable to a significant customer bears interest at a rate of libor plus per year  adjusted quarterly  and is due in december at december  the interest rate for the note was 
the note becomes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain events 
the customer has asserted that the entire principal amount of the note and all interest accrued thereon are currently due and payable and has filed a lawsuit to collect the obligation  we dispute that assertion and are vigorously defending the lawsuit 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of our debt fluctuates based on changes in interest rates
