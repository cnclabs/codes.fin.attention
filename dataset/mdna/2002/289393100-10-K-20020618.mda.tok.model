item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected historical financial data and the financial statements of the company and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
certain information discussed below may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions  it can give no assurance that its expectations will be achieved 
forward looking information is subject to certain risks  trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results 
among those risks  trends and uncertainties are the general economic climate  costs of food and labor  consumer demand  interest rate levels  restrictions imposed by the company s debt covenants  management control  availability of supplies  the availability of financing and other risks associated with the acquisition  development and operation of new and existing restaurants 
this list of risks and uncertainties is not exhaustive 
critical accounting policies the company s reported results are affected by the application of certain accounting policies that require subjective or complex judgements 
these judgements involve estimates that are inherently uncertain and may have a significant impact on our quarterly or annual results of operations and financial condition 
changes in these estimates and judgements could have significant effects on the company s results of operations and financial condition in future years 
we believe the company s most critical accounting policies cover accounting for long lived assets specifically property  buildings and equipment depreciation thereon and the valuation of intangible assets 
additional critical accounting policies govern revenue recognition and accounting for stock options 
property  buildings and equipment when the company purchases fixed assets  those assets are recorded at cost 
however  when the company acquires an operating restaurant or business  the company must allocate the purchase price between the fair market value of the tangible assets acquired and any excess to goodwill 
the fair market value of restaurant equipment fixtures and furnishings in an operating restaurant is difficult to separate from the going concern value of the restaurant 
most of the value of the equipment is due to the fact that it is in the restaurant and working 
the company values in place equipment with reference to replacement cost  age and condition  and utility in its intended use 
depreciation property  buildings and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line method over their estimated useful lives or the term of the related lease  whichever is shorter 
differences between the realized lives and the estimated lives could result in changes to the company s results from operations in future years  as well as changes in the rate of recurring capital expenditures 
intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of the company s intangible assets for impairment annually in accordance with fas these tests are primarily based on the cashflow of the underlying business units and the value of those cashflows in the marketplace 
changes in those cashflows or in the multiples assigned by the marketplace could result in the impairment of those assets and a subsequent writedown of goodwill 
revenue recognition the company s revenue is primarily from cash and credit card transactions 
as such  restaurant revenue is generally recognized upon receipt of cash or credit cards receipts 
franchise fees based upon a percent of the franchisees gross sales are recognized as the franchisees sales occur 
revenue from the lottery  which includes traditional ticket based games and video poker games is recorded on a commission basis  that is net of state regulated payouts 
expenses are record using accrual accounting based upon when goods and services are used 
stock options the company accounts for its stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
based on this methodology the company has not recorded any compensation costs related to its stock options since all options have been issued at an exercise price equal to or greater than the market value of the company s stock at the time of issuance 
included in note of the company s financial statements is the pro forma effect on the company s net income and earnings per share if compensation had been determined based on the estimated fair value of the options at the date of grant consistent with the provisions of sfas no

per share for the year ended april  for the year ended march   the company reported net income of approximately  or

during the year ended april   total assets increased approximately  to million 
increases in cash and marketable securities were largely offset by reductions in fixed assets due to the sale of the real estate in gresham  oregon to the franchisee

revenues for the year ended april  were greater than for the comparable period in reflecting the operations of the five mitzel s units for the full year as well as two additional company owned elmer s units 
same restaurant sales decreased and franchise and administrative services revenues increased due to the sale of two franchise agreements and the administrative services agreement with the yankee grills which commenced december  lottery revenues  as a percentage of total revenues  fell from to 
revenues for the year ended april  were greater than the comparable period in  driven primarily by the december  acquisition of the five mitzel s units 
restaurant costs and expenses 
as a percent of total revenue  food  beverage and supply costs were in compared to and of and respectively 
labor was of total revenue in compared to results in and of and respectively 
occupancy  depreciation  amortization and restaurant opening closing expenses totaled of revenue in compared to and results in of and respectively 
in the first six months of the year  the company saw a shift in sales to lower margin items  resulting in an increase in food beverage and supply costs as a percentage of revenues 
this seems to have stabilized in the second half of the year 
the decrease in labor as a percentage of revenue in over fiscal year is driven by improved operating efficiencies  partly offset by an increase in minimum wages rates in washington and california 
washington state minimum wage is now indexed to inflation and will be adjusted annually 
the decrease in occupancy  depreciation  amortization and restaurant opening closing expenses as a percentage of revenues in over is primarily due to lower restaurant opening closing expenses and the cessation of amortization under fas  which the company adopted in the first quarter of the fiscal year 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were of total revenue in fiscal compared and in fiscal and respectively 
the increase in general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues reflects the impact of integration expenses related to the mitzel s restaurant acquisition and increased marketing expenditures for those restaurants as well as an increase in resources devoted to franchise operations 
non operating income expenses 
this primarily reflects net interest expenses that were of total revenues in compared to and in fiscal and respectively 
the reduction in net interest expense as a percentage of revenues is primarily the result of increased revenues 
liquidity and capital resources as of april   the company had cash and equivalents of approximately  representing a decrease of approximately  during the fiscal year 
the decrease resulted from cash provided by operations totaling approximately million  less cash used in investing activities of approximately million and less cash used in financing activities of approximately million 
cash used in investing activities includes net additions to available for sale securities of million 
in addition to the regular replacement of depreciating restaurant assets  cash used in investing activities included the acquisition and subsequent conversion to the elmer s concept of the roseburg location 
cash used in financing activities includes early retirement of the mortgage debt on the gresham property of approximately  as well as  contributed to a sinking fund for the company s convertible debt 
the company s primary liquidity needs arise from debt service  operating lease requirements and the funding of capital expenditures 
as of april   the company had outstanding indebtedness of million under term loan facilities with ge capital  million in real estate loan facilities with wells fargo bank and million in convertible notes issued in a private placement 
the ge capital loan was originated in june with proceeds used to retire without penalty approximately million in wells fargo term debt and million in a term loan facility with eagles view management 
the ge capital loan fully amortizes over ten years  million of the loan has a fixed interest rate of 
interest is variable at basis points over day commercial paper currently approximately on the remaining million portion of the note 
the variable portion of the note can be fixed basis points above five year treasuries without penalty within the first two years 
the loan is collateralized by substantially all of the assets owned by elmer s restaurants  inc except for real estate assets 
the remaining wells fargo real estate debt has a weighted average maturity of years  bears interest at an average of  requires monthly payments of principal and interest  and is collateralized by three real estate assets 
the million of convertible notes have a remaining maturity of approximately six years  bear interest at  require monthly interest only payments  payments into a company held sinking fund  and are subordinated to other company funded debt 
the notes include a convertible feature that permits the holder to convert the principal of the note into common stock at any time at per share 
the company can redeem the notes after december  by paying a premium of or less depending on the years remaining to maturity 
certain of the company s debt agreements require compliance with debt covenants 
the most restrictive covenants require the company to maintain a maximum ratio of total liabilities  excluding subordinated debt  to tangible net worth plus subordinated debt of to  and a ratio of cash generation defined as net income before taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization to total interest expense plus the prior period current maturities of long term debt of at least to management believes that the company is in compliance with such requirements 
elmer s restaurants  inc  like most restaurant businesses  is able to operate with nominal or deficit working capital because sales are for cash and inventory turnover is rapid 
renovation and or remodeling of existing restaurants is either funded directly from available cash or  in some instances  is financed through outside lenders 
construction or acquisition of new restaurants is generally  although not always  financed by outside lenders 
the company believes that it will continue to be able to obtain adequate financing on acceptable terms for new restaurant construction and acquisitions and that cash generated from operations will be adequate to meet its financial needs and to pay operating expenses for the foreseeable future  although no assurances can be given 
contractual obligations the company makes a range of contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business and in conjunction with the acquisition and sale of restaurants 
the following table shows the company s contractual obligations commitment expiration period total amount year years committed or less years years or more term debt      convertible debt   operating leases      guarantees      totals      the covenants to the company s term debt require the company to maintain certain leverage and cash flow ratios discusses in detail in the footnotes to the financial statements 
the company believes it is in compliance with all debt covenants as of the fiscal year ended april   and the company expects it will continue to be in compliance 
however  in the event the company were out of compliance with the debt covenants  the terms of the loan agreements generally provide for the acceleration of repayment 
the company has issued promissory notes  convertible at the option of the holder  into common stock at per share 
the likelihood of conversion increases with any increase in the market price of the company s common stock above 
the company has signed long term occupancy leases for all but three of its restaurant locations 
these leases are recorded as operating leases  and costs are expensed as they become due 
under the terms of lease assignment agreements  the company has guaranteed certain franchisee occupancy leases five years 
in one case the guarantee could be extended for up to years 
in all cases these guarantees are in turn  personally guaranteed by the franchisee 
in the event the franchisee defaulted on the occupancy lease  the company could be required to pay all rent and other amounts due under the terms of the lease for the remainder of the guarantee term 
in the event of default  the company expects it would exercise its right to reoccupy and continue to operate the restaurants as elmer s breakfast 
lunch 
dinner tm these guarantees are further discussed in note of the financial statements 
inflation certain of the company s operating costs are subject to inflationary pressures  of which the most significant are food and labor costs 
as of april   a significant percentage of the company s employees were paid wages equal to or based on the state minimum hourly wage rates 
economic growth that would reduce unemployment or make more jobs available in higher paying industries could directly affect the company s labor costs 
the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its results of operations for fiscal  fiscal or fiscal substantial increases in costs could have a significant impact on the company and the industry 
if operating expenses increase  management believes it can recover increased costs by increasing prices to the extent deemed advisable considering competition 
seasonality the seasonality of restaurant sales due to consumer spending habits can be significantly affected by the timing of advertising  competitive market conditions and weather related events 
while restaurant sales for certain quarters can be stronger  or weaker  there is no predominant pattern
