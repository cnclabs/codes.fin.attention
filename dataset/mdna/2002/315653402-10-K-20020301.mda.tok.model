item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we deploy  own and operate fiber optic networks designed to provide comprehensive wholesale  broadband connectivity for data  voice and video transmission in major metropolitan areas 
these networks provide an advanced  high bandwidth  fiber optic solution to support the demand for network capacity in the local loop 
we believe that our end to end connectivity  carrier neutral position  rapid provisioning time and carrier class reliability will make us the preferred carrier s carrier for transport services in our markets 
from our inception through december   we were a development stage enterprise 
during this period  we had no commercial operations and did not record any revenues 
we engaged principally in organizational and developmental activities  including formulating our business plan  developing strategic relationships with vendors and property owners  gaining access to capital for future growth  hiring personnel  purchasing equipment  and deploying our communications networks 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we began providing services in the new york city market 
we are no longer a development stage enterprise for financial reporting purposes 
we began operating our first metropolitan network in january in new york city  and we began deploying our infrastructure in chicago and los angeles in the fourth quarter of as of december   we had accomplished the following 
we can provide fiber optic transport services in ten major carrier hotels in the new york metropolitan area  including hudson street and eighth avenue  four major carrier hotels in los angeles and one major carrier hotel in chicago 

we are operating our advanced  vertical in building networks  known as fibernet in building networks  or fins  in office buildings in new york city and seven in chicago 

we had exclusive license agreements that give us the right to manage communications access and infrastructure in approximately other office buildings nationwide 

we had customers and entered into interconnection agreements with existing and potential customers  establishing the basis for purchase orders from them 
we have experienced significant operating losses  net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities 
we expect to continue to experience such losses and negative cash flows as we continue to operate our business 
we also have a limited operating history 
consequently  prospective investors have limited operating history and financial data upon which to evaluate our performance 
the telecommunications industry is currently experiencing a period of uncertainty and rationalization 
many companies in our industry are in financial distress  and some of our largest customers have filed for bankruptcy 
we have been negatively impacted by the general economic environment and by the difficulties that are impacting our industry 
most significantly  customer contracts and services have been cancelled  resulting in a loss of recurring revenues to us 
we are unable to determine the extent to which additional contracts or services that we provide to our customers will be cancelled  and we cannot forecast our ability to replace those cancelled contracts with new contracts 
as a result  our revenues  business operations and liquidity may continue to be negatively affected by the market environment 
factors affecting future operations revenues 
we generate revenues from selling network capacity and related services to other communications service providers 
revenues are derived from three general types of services 
transport services 
our transport services include the offering of broadband circuits on our metropolitan transport networks and fins 
over our metropolitan transport networks  we can provision circuits from one of our carrier point facilities to another carrier point facility or to an on net building via an interconnection with our fin in that building 
we can also provision circuits vertically between floors in a carrier point facility or an on net building 

colocation services 
our colocation services include providing customers with the ability to locate their communications and networking equipment at our carrier point facilities in a secure technical operating environment 
we can also provide our customers with colocation services in the central equipment rooms of certain of our on net and off net buildings 
typically  if a customer colocates its equipment at our facilities  our agreement with them may include a minimum commitment to use our transport services 

communications access management services 
our access management services include providing our customers with the non exclusive right to market and provide their retail services to tenants in our on net and off net buildings 
customers typically enter into an agreement with us to gain access to all or a significant number of our properties 
for certain of on net and our off net buildings  we have the exclusive right to manage communications access 
once a customer has entered into an agreement with us for access services  we typically require that customer to utilize our in building networking infrastructure for connectivity to their retail customers  if such networking infrastructure is available 
our revenues are generated on a monthly recurring basis under contracts with our customers 
these terms of these contracts can range from month to month to five years in length 
during we experienced a trend of entering into shorter term contracts with our customers 
previously  our customers typically entered into contracts with terms of three to five years 
increasingly  our customers are electing to purchase services on a month to month basis or for a contracted period of only one year 
our services are typically sold under fixed price agreements 
in the case of transport services  we provide an optical circuit or other means of connectivity for a fixed price 
revenues from transport services are not dependent on customer usage or the distance between the origination point and termination point of a circuit 
the pricing of colocation services is based upon the size of the colocation space or the number of colocation units  such as cabinets  provided to the customer 
revenues from access management services are typically determined by the square footage of the commercial office properties to which a customer purchases access 
the pricing of all of our services have declined significantly over the past year  although we believe not to the extent that the pricing in other segments of the telecommunications market 
the growth of our revenues is dependent upon our ability to provide additional services in our existing facilities 
we also believe that the majority of the growth in our revenues will come from our existing customers 
consequently  our growth in revenues is dependent on the underlying growth of our customers businesses and their need for our services within the facilities that we already operate 
we continue to add additional customers 
however  we believe the number of companies that are potential customers is decreasing  due to the industry environment 
in addition  we currently do not anticipate expanding our network infrastructure to other carrier point facilities or on net buildings and off net buildings 
within each of our existing facilities  our revenues will depend upon the demand for our services  the competition that we face and our customer service 
we typically begin our sales cycle by entering into a non binding business services agreement with a customer 
this agreement establishes our mutual interest in exploring a business relationship and the general parameters upon which we will proceed 
as a next step  we execute a telecommunications services agreement  also known as an interconnection agreement 
this is a technical document that outlines the engineering specifications and operating standards that are required of us by the customer 
with the technical requirements complete  we finalize a sales contract 
customers can order a specific circuit or colocation space  or  alternatively  they can purchase general availability on our networks or in our facilities by establishing minimum revenue commitments on a recurring basis 
currently our colocation and access services produce approximately one third of our revenues 
in the future we anticipate generating significantly more of our revenues from transport services than from colocation or access management services 
the scalability of our network architecture allows us to increase transport capacity to a greater degree than is possible with our colocation and access services 
direct costs 
direct costs are associated with the operation of our networks and facilities 
the largest component of our direct costs is the occupancy expenses at our carrier point facilities  on net buildings and off net buildings 
because we have entered into long term leases or colocation agreements for the facilities  we do not expect to experience a significant change in occupancy expenses based upon our current deployment of network infrastructure 
other specific costs include maintenance and repair costs and utility costs 
our license agreements for our on net and off net buildings require us to pay license fees to the owners of these properties 
in addition  our lease for our meet me room at hudson street in new york city also requires us to pay a license fee 
these license fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the revenues that we generate in each particular building 
other than our license fees  our direct costs are generally fixed in nature 
we do not anticipate that direct costs will change commensurately with any change in our revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses generally include all of our personnel costs  occupancy costs for our corporate offices  insurance costs  professional fees  sales and marketing expenses and other miscellaneous expenses 
personnel costs  including wages  benefits and sales commissions  are our largest component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
we have reduced the number of our employees from at the beginning of to as of december   and our personnel costs have decreased significantly 
prospectively  we do not anticipate significant changes in headcount  and we believe that our personnel costs will increase moderately 
we do expect our insurance costs to increase materially upon our annual renewals as a result of increases in coverage premiums 
stock related expense 
stock related expense relates to the granting of stock options to our employees 
we grant stock options to our employees as a form of equity based compensation to attract  retain and incentivize qualified personnel 
these costs are non cash charges that are amortized over the vesting term of each employee s option agreement 
certain options granted to employees are accounted for using variable plan accounting 
under variable plan accounting  the stock related expense is adjusted for changes in the market price of the underlying common stock 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense includes the depreciation of our network equipment and infrastructure  computer hardware and software  furniture and fixtures  and leasehold improvements  as well as the amortization of goodwill and certain deferred charges 
we commence the depreciation of network related fixed assets when they are placed into service and depreciate those assets over periods ranging from three to years 
as a result of the impairments to goodwill and fixed assets that we recorded during  depreciation and amortization expense may decrease going forward 
significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results from operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates that we have made 
these estimates have been based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under difference assumptions or conditions 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  an allowance for doubtful accounts  the impairment of long lived assets including goodwill and the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we recognize revenues when earned as services are provided throughout the life of each contract with a customer 
the majority of our revenues are invoiced on a monthly recurring basis under long term contracts  typically one to five years in length 
certain of our contracts require us to invoice our customers for the periods ranging from one year to the full term of the contract 
we record deferred revenue for the amount of an invoice that has not been recognized as revenue 
deferred revenue is recorded for the full value of the contract at contract inception  only if we are contractually entitled to invoice the customer for the full value of the contract and the customer is obligated to pay such invoice  thereby creating a corresponding account receivable for us 
we have in the past entered into reciprocal agreements with four of our customers  whereby we purchase services from them 
the services provided and obtained through these agreements are priced at fair value as of the date of the agreement 
we recognized the transport and colocation revenues from these agreements in accordance with our stated revenue recognition policy  and we concurrently recorded the expenses for colocation services as direct costs in our statements of operations 
none of the expenses associated with our reciprocal agreements are capitalized 
all of the costs are expensed as incurred 
reciprocal agreements accounted for million  or  of revenues in and million of our direct costs 
in reciprocal agreements accounted for million  or  of revenues and million of our direct costs 
in  we terminated two of our reciprocal agreements  and in we anticipate terminating one additional reciprocal agreement 
consequently  we believe that revenues and expenses recorded under reciprocal agreements will decrease significantly in we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same level of credit losses that we have in the past 
a significant number of our customers have filed for bankruptcy or are otherwise in significant financial distress 
in addition  our revenues and accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers or a further deterioration in the economic environment or telecommunications industry  in general  could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results  including a reduction in future revenues and additional allowances for doubtful accounts 
if we determine that collection of a receivable is not reasonably assured  we defer the revenue and recognize it at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
we assess the fair value and recoverability of our long lived assets  including goodwill  whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in doing so  we make assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows and other factors to make our determination 
the fair value of our long lived assets and goodwill is dependent upon the forecasted performance of our business  changes in the telecommunications industry and the overall economic environment 
when we determine that the carrying value of our long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based upon a forecasted discounted cash flow method 
if these forecasts are not met  we may have to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
during  we performed an assessment of the goodwill related to our acquisition of devnet  llc  pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
devnet had entered into exclusive license agreements to manage communications access to commercial office properties  and we associated the goodwill resulting from the acquisition primarily to those agreements 
we made this determination based upon significant negative industry and economic trends 
in  a change in the business environment resulted in significantly less demand for telecommunications access to commercial office properties  and the number of potential customers seeking these services diminished greatly 
consequently  we revised our forecasted cash flows from devnet and determined that the decline in the market conditions within this market segment was material and other than temporary 
after using an undiscounted cash flow model of the future cash flows forecasted to be generated from business activities in the commercial office properties underlying the license agreements and determining there was an impairment  we used a discounted cash flow model to determine the size of the impairment 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million during the third quarter of to reduce goodwill associated with the purchase of devnet 
the charge was based on the amount by which the carrying amount of these assets exceeded their fair value 
during  we recorded approximately million of amortization of goodwill relating to devnet 
in december  the company revised its business plan and conducted extensive reviews of its assets and operations in connection with amending the credit facility see note 
based on the reviews  the company has recorded an asset impairment of approximately million to reflect the company s revised business plan and current state of the markets in which the company operates 
of this amount  million relates to assets held for use  and million represents assets to be disposed of 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based upon historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
as a result of this review  we have established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
restatement of financial statements we restated our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  to record a beneficial conversion feature of million in connection with the issuance of our senior secured convertible notes on may  and to reduce the beneficial conversion feature on the conversion of our series d  e and f preferred stock to zero 
in  we were a development stage company and did not record any revenue 
other than with respect to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   this restatement has no impact on our assets or total stockholders equity  and it resulted in a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital and a decrease in preferred stock and accumulated deficit 
the change increased net loss by million and decreased net loss applicable to common shareholders by million 
these changes decreased net loss applicable to common stockholders per share by 
the change has no impact on our cash flows 
we originally did not record a beneficial conversion relating to the issuance of the senior secured convertible notes  assuming a market value per share 
the restatement assumes a market value per share 
also  we incorrectly recorded a beneficial conversion of million on the subsequent conversion of our senior secured convertible notes issued during into preferred stock 
the restated financial statements include the correction of these errors 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the fiscal year ended december  were million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended december  revenues were generated by providing transport  colocation and communications access management services to our customers 
we recognized million in transport services in  up from million in this increase was primarily a result of strong demand for high bandwidth circuits within and between our carrier hotel facilities 
revenues from colocation and other services increased to million in from million in  and revenues from communications access management services grew to million in from million in prospectively  we expect transport services to grow at a faster rate than colocation and access management services 
our network infrastructure has significant capacity to provide additional broadband transport connectivity 
however  our colocation facilities are approaching more stabilized utilization rates 
we do not expect our access management services to grow significantly 
many companies that would have potentially purchased these services from us are in financial distress  and the demand for those companies services has not met with industry expectations 
during  three customers  networks  network plus and qwest  accounted for approximately of our revenues 
in  these customers accounted for of revenues 
two of those companies  networks and network plus  have filed for bankruptcy 
once a customer has filed for bankruptcy  we recognize revenues from that customer only upon the receipt of payment 
our revenues for were not impacted by the bankruptcy of network plus because the company filed for bankruptcy subsequent to year end 
prospectively  we expect these customers to represent a significantly lower percentage of our revenues 
reciprocal agreements accounted for million  or  of revenues in  up from million  or  of revenues in in  we terminated two of our reciprocal agreements  and in we anticipate terminating one additional reciprocal agreement 
we believe that revenues under reciprocal agreements will decrease significantly in direct costs 
direct costs  associated with the operation of our networks and facilities  were million in  compared to million in the majority of our direct costs are occupancy expenses  consisting of rent and utility costs  for our carrier hotel facilities  on net buildings and off net buildings 
other direct costs include license fees  maintenance and repair costs  and professional fees 
the increase in direct costs was primarily the result of the addition of new facilities in and incorporating a full year s expenses for facilities added in we do not expect direct costs to increase significantly in since we do not anticipate adding many new facilities 
reciprocal agreements accounted for million of our direct costs in and million of our direct costs in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were million compared to million for the initial increase in expenses resulting from the expansion of our operations in the first half of was partially offset in the second half of the year by our aggressive cost savings initiatives to reduce corporate overhead in line with our current outlook for business activity 
cost reductions were realized in nearly all components of selling  general and administrative expenses  including advertising and marketing costs  professional fees and travel and entertainment expenses 
the greatest decrease in overhead came in personnel costs  as we reduced headcount from employees at the beginning of to  as of december  in accordance with eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  an accrual of approximately  for severance benefits not yet paid at december  was recorded 
based upon the realization of these cost savings  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to decrease in stock related expense 
stock related expense for was million  compared to million for this non cash expense relates to the granting of stock options to employees 
the amount for the current period reflects a reversal of a previously recorded expense 
this reversal is due to a decline in the price per share of our common stock since the beginning of the current period 
in december we repriced stock options for certain of our executive officers  resulting in variable plan accounting in accordance with fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  from the date of modification 
the additional intrinsic value was determined on the date of modification using the then market price of the common stock 
the additional compensation cost was recognized over the period from the date of modification to the date the awards vest 
the additional compensation cost has been adjusted in subsequent periods for changes in the market price 
after the awards vested  adjustments to compensation cost for changes in the market price were recognized immediately 
in subsequent periods  the market price declined  resulting in negative compensation cost being recognized 
in accordance with fin  illustration g  income negative expense has been recognized up to the amount of expense previously recognized in prior periods relating specifically to the modified awards 
impairment of property  plant and equipment 
in december  the company recorded an asset impairment of million to reflect the company s revised business plan and the current state of the market 
no impairment of property  plant and equipment was recorded in impairment of goodwill 
in  we recorded a non cash  non recurring charge for the impairment of goodwill  relating to our acquisition of devnet  llc in the amount of million 
we recorded this write down of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
no impairment of goodwill was recorded in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for was million  compared to million for this increase resulted from the commencement of the depreciation of certain network related fixed assets that were placed into service  as well as amortization of goodwill from the purchase of devnet 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net for was million  compared to million in interest expense increased due to additional borrowings under our senior secured credit facility to fund the buildout of our networks  operating losses and working capital 
extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt 
in  we recorded a non cash charge of million related to an early extinguishment of debt from the modification of our credit facility on february  we did not record such a charge in preferred stock dividends 
in  we paid non cash dividends on our series d  e  f  h and i preferred stock of million in the form of additional shares of each respective series of preferred stock  which are convertible into shares of common stock  compared to million of dividends in we also recorded beneficial conversion charges of million and million upon the issuance of three new series of preferred stock issued during fiscal and  respectively 
the amounts of the dividends and the beneficial conversion charge assume the market price per share of the underlying common stock  as of the date the dividends are paid or the charge is incurred  in accordance with eitf issue  accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratio 
the significant decrease in the amount of preferred dividends was therefore a result of a decline in the public market price of our common stock 
the liquidation value of the dividends paid in was million  compared to million for dividends paid in net loss applicable to common stockholders 
we reported a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million in compared to a loss of million in the increase in the net loss applicable to common stockholders is a result of the aforementioned changes in our operations 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the fiscal year ended december  were million as compared to the fiscal year ended december  in which we had no commercial operations and did not generate any revenues 
revenues were generated by providing transport  colocation and communications access management services to our customers 
we recognized million in transport services  million in colocation services and million in communications access management and other services during the period 
during this period  two customers  networks and qwest  accounted for approximately of our revenues 
we expect such customer concentration to diminish as we expand our operations 
direct costs 
direct costs for fiscal were million  associated with the operation of our networks and facilities 
these costs included building license fees  maintenance and repair costs  rent expense at carrier point facilities and on net and off net buildings  and related utility costs 
during fiscal  we did not record any direct costs because we were not offering services during that period 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were million compared to million for this increase was the result of the rapid expansion of our operations 
we have experienced significant growth in personnel costs  marketing and advertising expenses  and network construction overhead to support our business strategy 
the number of significant transactions that we undertook during fiscal also resulted in significant professional fees 
stock related expense 
stock related expense for was million 
this non cash expense relates to the granting of stock options to employees 
we incurred million of stock related expense for depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal was million  compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million 
this increase resulted from the commencement of the depreciation of certain network related fixed assets that were placed into service  as well as amortization of goodwill from the purchase of devnet 
during fiscal  we aggressively deployed our network assets to execute our business strategy 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net for fiscal was million  compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million 
interest expense increased as a result of additional interest expense in due to borrowings under our senior secured credit facility to fund the buildout of our networks  operating losses and working capital 
preferred stock dividends 
during fiscal  we recorded preferred stock dividends of million in non cash dividends on the series d  e  f  h and i preferred stock of million in the form of additional shares of each respective series of preferred stock  which are convertible into shares of common stock 
the liquidation value of the dividends paid was million 
we also recorded a preferred stock beneficial conversion charge of million upon the issuance of three new series of preferred stock issued during fiscal during  we recorded million of preferred dividends related to our series d  e and f preferred stock 
we also recorded a preferred stock beneficial conversion charge of million related to the issuance of the series c preferred stock 
the amounts of the dividends and the beneficial conversion charge assume the market price per share of the underlying common stock  as of the date the dividends are paid or the charge is incurred 
net loss applicable to common stockholders 
we reported a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million for fiscal compared to a loss of million for fiscal  an increase of million 
the increase in the net loss applicable to common stockholders is a result of the aforementioned changes in our operations and the beneficial conversion charge of million 
liquidity and capital resources as a result of our developmental activities and the deployment of our networks and facilities  we have incurred significant losses from inception to date 
we expect such losses to continue  as we further execute our business plan and expand our operations 
consequently  we have been dependent upon external sources of capital to fund our operations 
prospectively  we will continue to incur losses and will not be able to fund our operations with internally generated funds 
therefore  we will require additional  external capital 
we are subject to unforeseen capital requirements  failure of market acceptance  failure to establish and maintain business relationships  competitive disadvantages against larger and more established companies and negative trends in our industry and the economy 
to date  we have financed our operations through direct equity investments from our stockholders  the issuance of additional debt and equity securities in private transactions and by arranging a senior secured credit facility with a group of lenders 
we incurred an ebitda loss as defined below and a net loss applicable to common stockholders for fiscal of million and million  respectively  compared to million and million  respectively  for fiscal during fiscal  cash used to fund operating activities was million  and cash purchases of property  plant and equipment were million  compared to million and million  respectively  for fiscal during fiscal  we received million in net cash proceeds from financing activities 
net proceeds from the issuance of equity securities during fiscal were million 
on february   we completed a million directed public offering of our common stock under our existing shelf registration statement 
we issued  shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share as well as warrants to purchase an additional  shares at an exercise price of per share with a term of three years 
on december   we completed another directed public offering under our existing shelf registration statement 
we issued shares of our series j preferred stock at a purchase price of  per share  as well as warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share with a term of five years 
the total proceeds to us from this offering were million  before offering expenses 
in addition  subject to certain conditions  the stock purchase agreement for this offering of series j preferred stock contemplates two additional closings in which we may sell in the aggregate an additional million of series j preferred stock to the initial purchasers 
we may opt out of one or both of these subsequent closings upon payment of cash consideration and upon approval of our lenders under our senior secured credit facility 
although we currently intend to consummate the two additional closings  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
our inability to complete either of these closings could have a material adverse affect on our liquidity and capital resources and would constitute an event of default under our senior secured credit facility 
the purchasers of our series j preferred stock are not obligated to participate in the second or third closings contemplated by the stock purchase agreement between us and them if  among other things  our existing shelf registration statement is no longer effective  we have breached any of our representations or warranties contained in the stock purchase agreement  we have failed to maintain ebitda positive results on a monthly basis beginning in december  or we have not obtained stockholder approval authorizing upon conversion of the issued and outstanding series j preferred stock the issuance of in excess of of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the closing date of the first series j preferred stock closing 
as of february  we are eligible to sell an additional million of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants under our existing shelf registration statement 
upon filing of this annual report we are no longer eligible to use our shelf registration statement for the issuance of such securities 
as a result  we will be required to file new registration statements with regard to any further registered issuances  if any  of our securities  and there can be no assurance that such registration statements will be declared effective 
subject to certain conditions  the stock purchase agreement we entered into with the purchasers of our series j preferred stock contemplates two additional closings in which we may sell in the aggregate an additional million of our securities to the purchasers 
accordingly  as a result of the expiration of our shelf registration statement  we will need to implement alternate means in order to complete the second and third closings  should we elect to do so  of which there can be no assurance 
on february   we increased our existing credit facility with deutsche bank ag new york branch  deutsche banc alex 
brown inc  first union investors  inc  first union securities  inc  toronto dominion usa securities inc and other lenders from million to million 
the maturity of the credit facility was extended to six years from four and one half years  and the initial interest rate was lowered to libor from libor 
in connection with this amended credit facility  we issued warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share with a term expiring april  in addition  as part of the amendment of our credit facility  all warrants issued under the original credit agreement were replaced with new warrants to purchase an equivalent amount of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
on april   in connection with a waiver and agreement under our credit facility  warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share held by deutsche banc alex 
brown were replaced with new warrants to purchase an equivalent amount of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
also  on december  we amended the credit facility to reflect the issuance of the series j preferred stock and related matters 
in connection with this amendment  all warrants previously issued under the credit agreement were replaced with new warrants to purchase an equivalent amount of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
as of february  the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility were million  and the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings under the facility was 
outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility totaled million 
as a result  we had million available to draw under the credit facility 
we were in full compliance with all of the covenants contained in the credit agreement underlying the facility 
our access to the additional availability under the credit facility is subject to our compliance with the covenants  and other terms and conditions  in the credit agreement 
material financial covenants monitored on a quarterly basis include minimum requirements for cumulative revenues and ebitda  a maximum limitation on capital expenditures  and compliance with ratios of total debt to consolidated capitalization and total debt to property  plant and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation 
in addition  the second and third closings for the issuance of the series j preferred are required under the credit agreement 
non compliance with any of these covenants  requirements  or other terms and conditions  constitutes an event of default under the credit agreement  prohibiting access to any additional funds available under the credit facility and potentially accelerating the outstanding balance for immediate payment 
on january  we entered into an interest rate swap transaction with deutsche bank ag for a notional amount of million and a term of two years 
pursuant to this transaction  we are obligated to make quarterly interest payments at a fixed  annual interest rate of 
because such interest rate excludes the applicable margin of that we pay on our credit facility  the total interest rate for us on this swap transaction is 
as part of this agreement  deutsche bank ag is obligated to pay to us on a quarterly basis a floating rate of interest based upon libor with a designated maturity of three months 
on december  we issued a promissory note in the amount of million to nortel networks inc  a related party  as consideration for accounts payable previously due and owing for equipment and services 
the note bears interest at an annual rate of and is payable in eight monthly installments of approximately  beginning in january as of february  the outstanding balance on the note was million 
we believe the terms of this transaction are no less favorable than could be received from an independent  third party 
we anticipate spending approximately between and million in capital expenditures during  primarily for the implementation of customer orders 
we have substantially completed the deployment of our fins  carrier hotel facilities and metropolitan transport networks 
we may expend additional capital for the selected expansion of our network infrastructure  depending upon market conditions  customer demand and our liquidity and capital resources 
our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts primarily include scheduled reductions in the availability of our credit facility  principal payments on our note payable and capital lease obligations  and payments under our operating leases 
the chart below identifies our outstanding contractual obligations and commitments as of february  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligation total thereafter mandatory repayments and reductions of indebtedness       capital lease obligations operating leases       other obligations total contractual obligations       our planned operations continue to require additional capital to fund equipment purchases  engineering and construction costs  marketing costs  administrative expenses and other operating activities 
although we reported that we generated positive ebitda for the month of december and expect to continue to do so in  there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve such a result prospectively 
we cannot fund our operating and investing activities with internally generated cash flows 
we continue to require external sources of capital 
the availability of funds from our credit facility and the expected closings of our series j preferred stock are critical to our liquidity 
from time to time  we may consider private or public sales of additional equity or debt securities and other financings  depending upon market conditions  in order to finance the continued operations of our business
