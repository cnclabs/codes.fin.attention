item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
statements in the following discussion may be forward looking and involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s financial results are most directly affected by changing prices for its production 
changing prices can influence not only current results of operations but the determination of the company s proved reserves and available sources of financing  including the determination of the borrowing base under the bank credit facility 
the company s results depend not only on hydrocarbon prices generally  but on its ability to market its production on favorable terms in the areas in which it is produced  including foreign areas such as thailand where the company s operations may be subject to local constraints on demand  currency restrictions  exchange rate fluctuations  the possibility of increases in taxes or other charges and non renewal or other adverse action relating to concessions or contracts  and other political risks 
on a longer term basis the company s financial condition and results of operations are affected by its ability to replace reserves as they are produced through successful exploration  development and acquisition activity 
the company s results could also be adversely affected by adverse regulatory developments and operational risks associated with oil and gas operations 
some of the other risks and uncertainties that may affect the company s results are mentioned in the discussion that follows 
on march   the company acquired north central through a direct merger with its parent company  noric corporation 
the company accounted for the merger using the purchase method of accounting 
therefore  the information contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this annual report do not reflect the operations of north central prior to that date 
in connection with the merger  the company paid  in cash to the former shareholders of noric  issued them  shares of common stock  and assumed approximately  of north central s debt 
as part of an ongoing asset rationalization process  the company identified certain non core properties and assets that it felt were underperforming  had little or no remaining upside potential  or faced significant future expenditures that would result in an unacceptable rate of return 
certain of these assets were sold during  including the company s canadian operations  which were sold effective august   its saginaw pipeline and certain of its other non core oil and gas properties that were divested during the fourth quarter 
results of operations net income the company reported net income for of  or per share  or per share on a diluted basis  compared to net income for of  or per share  or per share on a diluted basis  and net income for of  or per share on both a basic and a diluted basis 
net income in was adversely affected by a one time  non cash charge related to a change in accounting principles required by the commission 
historically  the company recorded oil and condensate inventory held for sale principally in the fpso and fso in thailand at fair market value as of the close of the accounting period 
however  the commission announced in that it would require such inventory to be recorded as inventory at cost 
the  one time charge reflects a catch up adjustment for years prior to the company does not currently expect to incur any similar charges related to this issue in the future 
among other items affecting net income for  and were net gains of   and  respectively  related to the company s sale of certain non strategic properties as part of its asset rationalization process 
the  recorded in reflects gains of  on the sale of the company s canadian operations  a partial interest in the company s south pass pipeline and various non strategic offshore properties  which was partially offset by a  loss on the sale of the company s saginaw pipeline and various other non strategic offshore properties 
the company has announced that it will continue to examine its underperforming and non strategic assets and will sell them if it believes that it can obtain a fair price  but that it does not currently believe that such sales will have a material impact on the company s ongoing business activities 
earnings per common share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for of   on a diluted basis  compared to   on a diluted basis for and   on a diluted basis for the increase in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for  compared to and  resulted primarily from the issuance of  shares of common stock to former shareholders of noric on march   in connection with the north central acquisition and  to a much lesser extent  the issuance of shares upon the exercise of stock options pursuant to the company s stock option plans and stock issued as compensation 
the earnings per share computation on a diluted basis in and primarily reflects additional shares of common stock issuable upon the assumed conversion of the company s convertible subordinated notes due the notes and the trust preferred securities and the elimination of related interest requirements  as adjusted for applicable federal income taxes and  to a lesser extent  the assumed exercise of options to purchase common shares 
the earnings per share computation on a diluted basis in reflect the assumed exercise of options to purchase common shares 
in addition  the number of common shares outstanding in the diluted computation is adjusted to include dilutive shares that are assumed to have been issued by the company in connection with outstanding options  less treasury shares that are assumed to have been purchased by the company from the option proceeds 
total revenues the company s total revenues for were  an increase of approximately compared to total revenues of  for  and an increase of approximately compared to total revenues of  for the increase in the company s total revenues for  compared to and  resulted primarily from increased oil and gas revenues that were partially offset  in comparison with  by a decrease in gains on property sales 
oil and gas revenues the company s oil and gas revenues for were  an increase of approximately from oil and gas revenues of  for  and an increase of approximately from oil and gas revenues of  for the following table reflects an analysis of variances in the company s oil and gas revenues expressed in thousands between and the previous two years compared to increase decrease in oil and gas revenues resulting from variances in natural gas price production crude oil and condensate price production natural gas liquids increase decrease in oil and gas revenues the increase in the company s oil and gas revenues in  compared to  is related to increases in the company s hydrocarbon production volumes and  to a lesser extent  increases in the average prices that it received for its natural gas production volumes  which was only partially offset by decreases in the average prices that the company received for its crude oil and condensate production volumes 
the increase in the company s oil and gas revenues in  compared to  is related to increases in the company s hydrocarbon production volumes and  to a lesser extent  increases in the average prices that the company received for such production volumes 
the increase in oil and gas revenues for  compared to  was also partially offset by a decline in the average price that the company received for its ngl production volumes from in to in change to change to comparison of increases decreases in natural gas average prices north america kingdom of thailand thai baht a company wide average price average daily production volumes mmcf per day north america kingdom of thailand a company wide average daily production crude oil and condensate average prices north america kingdom of thailand company wide average price average daily production volumes bbls per day north america kingdom of thailand a company wide average daily production total liquid hydrocarbons company wide average daily production bbls per day a production from the benchamas field commenced in july the contractual provisions of the gas sales agreement negatively affected prices received for the company s natural gas production during the period from october through august when the company did not meet the contractual dcq 
natural gas thailand prices 
the price that the company receives under the gas sales agreement for its natural gas production from the thailand concession normally adjusts on a semi annual basis 
however  the gas sales agreement provides for adjustment on a more frequent basis in the event that certain indices and factors on which the price is based fluctuate outside a given range 
during  these indices and factors  including the thai baht dollar exchange rate  were relatively stable  resulting in no adjustments to the gas price other than the two regularly scheduled semi annual adjustments 
prices received by the company under the recently signed memorandum of understanding are of the then current price under the gas sales agreement 
in addition  certain penalty provisions in the gas sales agreement adversely affected prices received by the company for its natural gas production during the period from october  through august see business international operations  contractual terms governing the thailand concession and related production 
production 
the increase in the company s natural gas production during  compared to and  was primarily related to the production from properties acquired in the north central acquisition and  to a lesser extent  increased production from the company s thailand concession  which was partially offset by decreased production from the company s properties located in the gulf of mexico due to natural production decline 
the company currently believes that production from its mississippi canyon blocks field and other development drilling projects scheduled for will lead to increased natural gas production from the gulf of mexico in crude oil and condensate thailand prices 
since the inception of production from the tantawan field  crude oil and condensate has been stored on the fpso until an economic quantity was accumulated for offloading and sale 
the first such sale of crude oil and condensate from the tantawan field occurred in july commencing in july when production began from the benchamas field  crude oil and condensate from that field has been stored on the fso and sold as economic quantities were accumulated 
prices that the company receives for its crude oil and condensate production from thailand are based on world benchmark prices  typically as a differential to malaysian tapis blend crude and are denominated in dollars 
the differential has varied over the years and is influenced by a number of factors including  among others  tanker availability  worldwide crude oil supply and demand  the size of the lifting and the perceived quality of the production from the tantawan and benchamas fields 
over the last year  the differential has generally ranged anywhere from to per bbl below the malaysian tapis blend benchmark price 
in addition  the company has generally been paid for its crude oil and condensate production from thailand in dollars 
as discussed previously under results of operations  net income  the company records all crude oil held in the fpso and the fso at the end of an accounting period as inventory held at cost 
when such crude oil is sold  usually during the following month  the difference between the cost of the crude oil and the sales price is recorded as income 
production 
the increase in the company s crude oil and condensate production during  compared to and  resulted primarily from increased production from the benchamas field in the kingdom of thailand and  to a lesser extent  production from properties obtained in the north central acquisition  which was partially offset by a decline in production from certain of the company s other domestic properties  principally in the offshore gulf of mexico 
the company currently expects that its crude oil and condensate production will increase substantially in  primarily as a result of increased production from the company s main pass blocks field  which commenced production in early january  its ewing bank block field which commenced production in the first quarter of and the benchamas field where facility capacity upgrades and five new platforms are scheduled for completion during ngl production 
the company s oil and gas revenues  and its total liquid hydrocarbon production  reflect the production and sale by the company of ngl  which are liquid products that are extracted from natural gas production 
the decrease in ngl revenues for  compared with  primarily related to a substantial decrease in the average price that the company received for its ngl production  from per bbl in to per bbl in  and a small decrease in ngl production 
the increase in ngl revenues for  compared to  primarily related to an increase in the average price that the company received for its ngl production  from per bbl in to per bbl in and a small increase in ngl production

the increase in north american lease operating expenses for  compared to  was primarily related to increased costs associated with properties acquired in the north central acquisition  an approximately  increase in severance taxes resulting from both increased production from the company s non us government owned properties and increased prices that the company received for that production  and generally increased costs resulting from an industry wide increase in demand for oil field services and equipment  that was only partially offset by decreased lease maintenance expenses 
the company has noted that oil field service and equipment costs have generally begun to moderate in the second half of  but expects that this trend is dependent on continued weakness in crude oil and natural gas prices 
the increase in lease operating expenses in the kingdom of thailand for  compared to  primarily related to increased expenses related to well workovers and increased insurance expenses related to construction of platforms for the benchamas field  as well as generally increasing costs resulting from an industry wide increase in demand for oil field services and equipment 
the increase in lease operating expenses in the kingdom of thailand for  compared to  primarily related to a full year s operations in benchamas field which commenced production in july  increased expenses related to well workovers and increased insurance expenses related to construction of platforms for the benchamas field  as well as generally increasing costs resulting from an industry wide increase in demand for oil field services and equipment and the presence in of a special credit related to contract services for which no equivalent benefit was experienced in a substantial portion of the company s lease operating expenses in the kingdom of thailand relate to lease payments made in connection with the bareboat charter of the fpso for the tantawan field and the fso for the benchamas field 
collectively  these lease payments accounted for approximately   and  net to the company s interest of the company s thailand lease operating expenses for  and  respectively 
the company currently expects these lease payments to remain relatively constant at approximately  net to the company s interest for the next five years 
see liquidity and capital resources  capital requirements  other material long term commitments 
notwithstanding the overall increase in lease operating expenses  on a per unit of production basis  the company s total lease operating expenses decreased slightly from an average of per mcfe for both and  to per mcfe for pipeline operating and natural gas purchases revenue from the sale of natural gas purchased for resale is reported under pipeline sales and other 
primarily all of the natural gas purchased and resold by the company was transported on pogo onshore pipeline company s saginaw pipeline 
as previously discussed  this pipeline was sold in the fourth quarter of as part of the company s ongoing asset rationalization process 
the decrease in pipeline operating expenses and natural gas purchase costs for  compared to  primarily related to the decreased cost of natural gas purchased for resale by the company 
the increase in pipeline operating expenses and natural gas purchase costs for  compared to  primarily related to increased cost of natural gas purchased for resale by the company 
general and administrative expenses the increase in general and administrative expenses for  compared with and  primarily related to increased expenses associated with the company s acquisition of north central and its employees  as well as an increase in the size of the company s work force and normal salary and concomitant benefit expense adjustments 
notwithstanding the overall increase in general and administrative expenses  on a per unit of production basis  the company s general and administrative expenses declined to per mcfe in  from per mcfe in and per mcfe in exploration expenses exploration expenses consist primarily of rental payments required under oil and gas leases to hold non producing properties delay rentals and geological and geophysical costs that are expensed as incurred 
the increase in exploration expenses for  compared to and  resulted primarily from the cost of conducting two d surveys in hungary  the cost of transferring certain seismic licenses in connection with the north central acquisition and the cost of acquiring substantial new speculative d data sets in the gulf of mexico  for which no comparable expenses were incurred in either or  which was partially offset in by acquisition costs related to the company s thibodaux d survey 
dry hole and impairment expenses dry hole and impairment expenses relate to costs of unsuccessful wells drilled 
accounting rules also require that if the expected future cash flow of the company s reserves on a property fall below the cost that is recorded on the company s books  these reserves must be impaired and written down to the property s fair value 
no such impairments are currently required on the company s properties 
depending on market conditions  including the prices for oil and natural gas  and the results of operations  a similar test may be conducted at any time to determine whether impairments are appropriate 
depending on the results of this test  an impairment could be required on some of the company s properties and this impairment could have a material negative non cash impact on the company s earnings and balance sheet 
the decrease in the company s dry hole and impairment expense for  compared to  resulted primarily from the comparative success of the company s drilling program  that was partially offset by an impairment expense recorded earlier in on a non operated property located in the offshore gulf of mexico that incurred unexpectedly high drilling and completion expenses 
the increase in the company s dry hole and impairment expense for  compared to  resulted from an increase in dry hole costs and the impairment expense discussed previously 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses the company accounts for its oil and gas activities using the successful efforts method of accounting 
under the successful efforts method  lease acquisition costs and all development costs are capitalized 
unproved properties are reviewed quarterly to determine if there has been impairment of the carrying value  with any such impairment charged to expense in the period 
proved oil and gas properties are reviewed when circumstances suggest the need for such a review and  if required  the proved properties are written down to their estimated fair value 
estimated fair value includes the estimated present value of all reasonably expected future production  prices and costs 
exploratory drilling costs are capitalized until the results are determined 
if proved reserves are not discovered  the exploratory drilling costs are expensed 
interest costs related to financing major oil and gas projects in progress are capitalized until the projects are substantially complete and ready for their intended use if projects are evaluated as successful 
other exploratory costs are expensed as incurred 
the provision for dd a expense is based on the capitalized costs  as determined in the preceding paragraph  plus future costs to abandon offshore wells and platforms  and is determined on a cost center by cost center basis using the units of production method 
the company generally creates cost centers on a field by field basis for oil and gas activities in the gulf of mexico and gulf of thailand 
generally  the company establishes cost centers on the basis of an oil or gas trend or play for its onshore oil and gas activities 
the increase in the company s dd a expenses for  compared to and  resulted primarily from an increase in the company s natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon production and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the company s composite dd a rate 
the increase in the composite dd a rate for all of the company s producing fields for  compared to and  resulted primarily from production from fields acquired in the north central acquisition that  because they were valued at fair market value in connection with the acquisition  contribute a dd a rate higher than the company s recent historic average 
the increase was partially offset by an increased percentage of the company s production coming from certain of the company s fields that have dd a rates that are lower than the company s recent historical composite rate principally the benchamas field and certain permian basin properties and a corresponding decrease in the percentage of the company s production coming from fields that have dd a rates that are higher than the company s recent historical composite dd a rate 
interest interest charges 
the increase in the company s interest charges for  compared to and  resulted primarily from an increase in the average amount of the company s outstanding debt related to the acquisition of north central  and to a much lesser extent  increased commitment fees and amortization of debt issuance expense  partially offset by a decline in the average interest rate on the outstanding debt 
interest income 
the increase in the company s interest income for  compared to and  resulted primarily from an increase in the amount of cash and cash equivalents temporarily invested  that was only partially offset by a decrease in the interest rate received 
the cash and cash equivalents on the company s balance sheet are primarily held by the company s international subsidiaries for future investment overseas  in part due to the negative tax effects caused by repatriation of these funds 
capitalized interest 
interest costs related to financing major oil and gas projects in progress are capitalized until the projects are substantially complete and ready for their intended use if projects are evaluated as successful 
the increase in capitalized interest for  compared to and  resulted primarily from an increase in the amount of capital expenditures subject to interest capitalization during approximately  compared to approximately  and approximately  that was only partially offset by a decrease in the computed rate that the company uses to apply on such capital expenditures to arrive at the total amount of capitalized interest 
a substantial percentage of the company s capitalized interest expense related to unevaluated properties acquired in the north central acquisition and capital expenditures for the development of the benchamas field in the gulf of thailand and several development projects in the gulf of mexico 
the company currently expects the amount of capital expenditures subject to interest capitalization to decrease during due to completion of fabrication of platforms and facilities to be installed in thailand and in the offshore gulf of mexico 
minority interest dividends and costs associated with mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of a subsidiary trust pogo trust i  a business trust in which the company owns all of the issued common securities  issued  of trust preferred securities on june  the amounts recorded under minority interest dividends and costs associated with mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of a subsidiary trust principally reflect cumulative unpaid dividends and  to a lesser extent  the amortization of issuance expenses related to the offering and sale of the trust preferred securities 
foreign currency transaction gain loss the foreign currency transaction losses reported for and and the gain reported in  resulted primarily from the fluctuation against the dollar of cash and other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in thai baht that were on thaipo s and b partners limited s financial statements during the respective periods 
during  the thai baht dollar exchange rate fluctuated between and baht to the dollar 
the company cannot predict what the thai baht to dollar exchange rate will be in the future 
as of march   the company was not a party to any financial instrument that was intended to constitute a foreign currency hedging arrangement 
income tax expense changes in the company s income tax expense are a function of the company s consolidated effective tax rate and its pre tax income 
the decrease in the company s tax expense for  compared to  resulted primarily from reevaluating certain estimates regarding its global tax and cash position and  as a result  recognizing certain additional tax benefits attributable to previously unrecognized thai net operating loss carryforwards  partially offset by the provision for us income taxes on certain unremitted foreign earnings and other tax adjustments 
the increase in the company s tax expense for  compared to  resulted primarily from an increase in pre tax income 
the company s consolidated effective tax rate for  and was  and  respectively 
the company conducts its operations in taxing jurisdictions with varying tax rates 
the relative proportion of the company s income earned in each taxing jurisdiction affects the company s consolidated effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows the company s consolidated statement of cash flows for reflects net cash provided by operating activities of  including receipts of  on natural gas option contracts purchased in in connection with the acquisition of north central 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk current hedging activity  natural gas 
in addition to net cash provided by operating activities  the company received proceeds of  from the issuance of the notes  proceeds of  related to the sale of its canadian operations  proceeds of  from the sale of certain non core properties and other assets and  from the exercise of stock options 
the company also acquired  in cash and cash equivalents as part of its acquisition of north central 
during  the company invested  of such cash flow in capital projects  paid former shareholders of noric  in partial consideration for their shares of noric capital stock  repaid  of debt that was acquired in the north central acquisition  borrowed a net  under its revolving credit facility and other senior debt agreements  spent  to purchase proved reserves  paid  in cash dividends to holders of its trust preferred securities  paid  per share for each quarter of in cash dividends to holders of the company s common stock and paid  in financing issuance expenses 
as of february   the company s cash and cash investments were  its long term debt stood at  and it had  in trust preferred securities outstanding 
future capital requirements the company s capital and exploration budget for  which does not include any amounts that may be expended for the purchase of proved reserves or any interest which may be capitalized resulting from projects in progress  was established by the company s board of directors at  the company currently anticipates that its available cash and cash investments  cash provided by operating activities and funds available under its credit agreement and its banker s acceptance facility  will be sufficient to fund the company s ongoing operating  interest and general and administrative expenses  its authorized capital budget  and dividend and distribution payments at current levels 
the declaration of future dividends on the company s equity securities will depend upon  among other things  the company s future earnings and financial condition  liquidity and capital requirements  its ability to pay dividends and other payments under certain covenants contained in its debt instruments  the general economic and regulatory climate and other factors deemed relevant by the company s board of directors 
other material long term commitments thaipo and its co venturers in the tantawan field collectively  the charterers are parties to a charter agreement the charter with tantawan production bv for the charter of the fpso for use in the tantawan field

the charter expires on july   subject to extension 
in addition  the charterers have a purchase option on the fpso throughout the term of the charter at prices determined by reference to the charter  which prices decline over time to a final purchase price of   net to thaipo at the end of the primary lease term 
as of january   the purchase price for the fpso was approximately   net to thaipo 
sbm marine services thailand ltd 
has been contracted to operate the fpso on a reimbursable basis throughout the initial term of the charter 
liability on the charter is full recourse as to each joint venturer  as to performance but the payment obligations are several  meaning that each joint venturer s payment obligations under the charter are still limited to its percentage interest in the tantawan field 
thaipo s performance and payment obligations are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the company  but only as to thaipo s pro rata share of the obligations arising under the charter 
the agreement to operate the fpso is non recourse to the company 
the charter currently provides for a charter hire commitment of  per year  net to thaipo through january   and a decreasing amount thereafter 
as of january   the total remaining lease payment obligation on the fpso amounted to   net to thaipo 
as of august   the charterers entered into a bareboat charter agreement the bca with watertight shipping bv for the charter of the fso 
see business international operations

the purchase price for the fso as of january  was approximately   net to thaipo 
the charterers have also contracted with another company  tanker pacific thailand co 
ltd  to operate the fso on a fixed fee basis throughout the initial term of the bca 
performance of both the bca and the agreement to operate the fso are non recourse to the company 
however the obligations of each joint venturer are full recourse to each joint venturer  but the payment obligations under the bca are several  meaning that each joint venturer s payment obligations are limited to its percentage interest in the thailand concession

capital structure credit facility 
effective march   the company terminated its existing credit facility and entered into a new revolving credit facility the credit facility with a group of lenders 
the credit facility provides for a  revolving loan facility terminating on march  the amount that may be borrowed under the new facility may not exceed a borrowing base that is determined no less than semi annually and is calculated based upon substantially all of the company s proved oil and gas properties 
the borrowing base is currently set at  the next redetermination of the borrowing base is expected to occur by may  the borrowing base is determined by the lenders based on their own proprietary credit criteria  which appear to be strongly correlated to the quantity of the company s proven oil and gas reserves and the lenders expectations as to the future revenues that the company can expect to receive from the sale of these oil and gas reserves 
a significant decline in the prices that the company is expected to receive for its future oil and gas production could have a materially negative impact on the borrowing base under the credit facility which  in turn  could have a material negative impact on the company s liquidity 
the credit facility is governed by various financial and other covenants  including requirements to maintain positive working capital excluding current maturities of debt and a fixed charge coverage ratio  and limitations on creation of liens  commodity hedging above specified limits  the prepayment of subordinated debt  the payment of dividends  mergers and consolidations  investments and asset dispositions

the credit facility also permits short term swing line loans and the issuance of up to  in letters of credit as a part of the facility 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest  at the company s option  at a base prime rate plus a variable margin currently none or libor plus a variable margin currently 
the margin varies as a function of the percentage of the borrowing base being utilized and  with respect to the libor rate loans  the company s credit rating 
a commitment fee on the unborrowed amount that is currently available under the credit facility is also charged based upon the percentage of the borrowing base that is being utilized

the company may cause the trust to defer the payment of distributions for successive periods up to consecutive quarterly periods unless an event of default on the debentures has occurred and is continuing 
during such periods  accrued distributions on the trust preferred securities will compound quarterly and the company will generally not be permitted to declare or pay distributions on its common stock or debt securities that rank equal or junior to the debentures 
the trust preferred securities are convertible at the option of the holder at any time into common stock of the company at the rate of shares of company common stock per trust preferred security 
this conversion rate will be subject to adjustment to prevent dilution and is currently equivalent to a conversion price of per share of company common stock 
the trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity of the debentures on june   or to the extent of any earlier redemption of any debentures by the company and are callable by the trust at any time  in whole or in part  after june   at any time  at a redemption price of of their principal 
the redemption premium will decline over the next several years 
in addition  if certain tax changes occur so that the trust becomes subject to federal income taxes or interest payments made by the company to the trust on the debentures are no longer deductible for federal income tax purposes  the trust may liquidate and distribute debentures to holders of the trust preferred securities and  in certain circumstances  the company may shorten the stated maturity of the debentures to as early as june  other matters inflation 
publicly held companies are asked to comment on the effects of inflation on their business 
currently annual inflation in terms of the decrease in the general purchasing power of the dollar is running much below the general annual inflation rates experienced in the past 
while the company  like other companies  continues to be affected by fluctuations in the purchasing power of the dollar due to inflation  such effect is not currently considered significant 
southeast asia economic issues 
a substantial portion of the company s oil and gas operations are conducted in southeast asia  and a substantial portion of its natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon production is sold there 
southeast asia in general  and the kingdom of thailand in particular  experienced severe economic difficulties in and which were characterized by sharply reduced economic activity  illiquidity  highly volatile foreign currency exchange rates and unstable stock markets 
since that time  the economic situation in the kingdom of thailand has generally stabilized 
however  as with most emerging market economies  the thai economy remains particularly sensitive to worldwide economic trends 
the economic health of the thai economy and its effect on the volatility of the thai baht against the dollar will continue to have a material impact on the company s operations in the kingdom of thailand  together with the prices that the company receives for its oil and natural gas production there 
see results of operations  oil and gas revenues and results of operations  foreign currency transaction gain loss 
all of the company s current natural gas production from the thailand concession is committed under a long term gas sales agreement or the memorandum of understanding  in each case to ptt at prices denominated in thai baht which are determined in accordance with a formula that is intended to ameliorate  at least in part  any decline in the purchasing power of the thai baht against the dollar 
see business international operations  contractual terms governing the thailand concession and business miscellaneous  sales 
although the company currently believes that ptt will honor its commitments under the gas sales agreement and the memorandum of understanding  a failure by ptt to honor such commitments could have a material adverse effect on the company 
during  the government of thailand partially privatized the petroleum authority of thailand  forming ptt and retaining an ownership interest of approximately 
ptt is a publicly traded entity that currently constitutes one of  if not the largest  public companies in the kingdom of thailand 
however  its contractual obligations are no longer backed by the full faith and credit of the thai government 
a consortium of companies has raised this issue with ptt and the government of thailand  but no satisfactory resolution of this issue has yet been achieved 
the company s crude oil and condensate production from the thailand concession is currently sold on a tanker load by tanker load basis 
prices that the company receives for such production are based on world benchmark prices  which are denominated in dollars  and are typically paid in dollars

recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has recently issued two new pronouncements  statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount  a gain or loss is recognized 
the company currently intends to adopt this standard on january  adoption of the standard will result in recording a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to earnings in the period of adoption 
sfas will impact the way in which the company  and most of the oil and gas industry  accounts for its future abandonment obligations 
the company has not yet quantified the financial statement impact from adoption of this new standard 
however  the company currently expects that initial adoption of sfas will result in a substantial positive accounting adjustment to earnings in the period it is adopted  but that earnings in subsequent periods will be negatively affected by a non cash increase to dd a expense and lease operating expenses 
the company also anticipates that the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on the company s balance sheet  resulting in a significant increase to both property and equipment and long term liabilities 
sfas sfas addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes sfas but retains its fundamental provisions for the a recognition and measurement of impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and b measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
for segments of a business to be disposed of  but retains the requirement to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of  or is classified as held for sale 
the company adopted sfas effective january  implementation of the new standard had no impact upon adoption and is not currently expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including adverse changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk the company produces  purchases and sells natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls 
as a result  the company s financial results can be significantly affected as these commodity prices fluctuate widely in response to changing market forces 
in the past  the company has made limited use of a variety of derivative financial instruments only for non trading purposes as a hedging strategy to manage commodity prices associated with oil and gas sales and to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations 
see business competition and market conditions 
interest rate risk from time to time  the company has entered into various financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to manage the impact of changes in interest rates 
as of march   the company has no open interest rate swap or interest rate lock agreements 
therefore  the company s exposure to changes in interest rates primarily results from its short term and long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates 
the following table presents principal or notional amounts stated in thousands and related average interest rates by year of maturity for the company s debt obligations and their indicated fair market value at december  thereafter total fair value long term debt variable rate average interest rate fixed rate average interest rate foreign currency exchange rate risk in addition to the dollar  the company and certain of its subsidiaries conduct their business in thai baht and hungarian forint and are therefore subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales  expenses  financing and investing transactions 
the company conducts a substantial portion of its oil and gas production and sales in southeast asia 
southeast asia in general  and the kingdom of thailand in particular  have experienced severe economic difficulties  including sharply reduced economic activity  illiquidity  highly volatile foreign currency exchange rates and unstable stock markets 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations  foreign currency transaction gain loss and liquidity and capital resources  other matters  southeast asia economic issues 
the economic situation in thailand and the volatility of the thai baht against the dollar will continue to have a material impact on the company s thailand operations and prices that the company receives for its oil and gas production there 
although the company s sales to ptt under the gas sales agreement and the memorandum of understanding are denominated in baht  because predominantly all of the company s crude oil sales and its capital and most other expenditures in the kingdom of thailand are denominated in dollars  the dollar is the functional currency for the company s operations in the kingdom of thailand 
as of march   the company is not a party to any foreign currency exchange agreement 
exposure from market rate fluctuations related to activities in hungary  where the company s functional currency is the forint  is not material at this time 
current hedging activity from time to time  the company has used and expects to continue to use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of its oil and gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce its exposure to price fluctuations 
while the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counter parties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
all of the company s recent historical hedging transactions have been carried out in the over the counter market with investment grade institutions 
approximately of the company s production  on an energy equivalent basis  or of its natural gas production  was subject to commodity price hedging arrangements 
natural gas as of december   the company held options to sell million cubic feet of natural gas production per day through december  these contracts give the company the right  but not the obligation  to sell natural gas at a sales price of per million british thermal units mmbtu for the period from january through march and per mmbtu for the period from april through december these contracts are designed to guarantee a minimum floor price for the contracted volumes of production without limiting the company s participation in price increases during the covered period 
as of december   the company was a party to the following hedging arrangements contract period volume in mmbtu a nymex contract price per mmbtu a fair value b floor contracts january march april december a mmbtu means million british thermal units 
b fair value is calculated using prices derived from nymex futures contract prices existing at december  these hedging transactions are settled based upon the average of the reported settlement prices on the nymex for the last three trading days or  occasionally  the penultimate trading day of a particular contract month 
for any particular floor transaction  the counter party is required to make a payment to the company if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor price for such transaction 
the company is not required to make any payment in connection with the settlement of a floor transaction 
crude oil as of march   the company was not a party to any commodity price hedging contracts with respect to any of its current or future crude oil and condensate production
