item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company receives revenues from a number of sources  principally licensing  television programming and media buying 
the company typically derives a substantial portion of its licensing revenues from a small number of properties  which properties usually generate revenues only for a limited period of time 
because the company s licensing revenues are highly subject to changing fashion in the toy and entertainment business  its licensing revenues from year to year from particular sources are subject to dramatic increases and decreases 
it is not possible to anticipate precisely the length of time a property will be commercially successful  if at all 
popularity of properties can vary from months to years 
as a result  the company s revenues and net income may fluctuate significantly between comparable periods 
the company s licensing revenues have historically been primarily derived from the license of toy and game concepts 
thus  a substantial portion of the company s licensing revenues and net income are subject to the seasonal variations and popularity trends of the toy and game industry 
typically  a majority of toy orders are shipped in the third and fourth calendar quarters 
in addition  the company s media buying subsidiary concentrates its activities on the youth oriented market 
as a result  most of its revenue is earned in the third and fourth quarters when the majority of toy and video game advertising occurs 
in the company s usual experience  its net income during the second half of the year will generally be greater than during the first half of the year 
however  the company s revenues in fiscal were influenced more by the popularity trend and movie release dates of pokemon than the historical seasonal trends of toy and game sales 
further  the company has little control over the timing of royalty payments it receives  some of which are made upon the execution and delivery of license agreements 
significant accounting policies and estimates in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could result in the company reporting financial results that differ significantly from the estimates previously used by the company which were based on different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which require managements most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the notes to the financial statements  located elsewhere in this annual report filing 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies which are described below 
description and accounting basis for revenues kids entertainment  inc and subsidiaries the company is an integrated entertainment and media company consisting of three segments  licensing  television and film production and distribution and media planning and buying services 
all three segments are focused on the youth oriented market 
licensing business license agreements often include nonrefundable minimum guaranteed royalties which are payable by the licensee 
the company records as commission revenue its proportionate share of the minimum guarantee when all material terms of the contracts have been agreed to by the parties  a cash payment or reasonable assurance of collectability is received and any performance contingencies have been met 
it is at this point that the company has substantially performed all of its obligations under the contract 
for contracts not providing minimum guaranteed royalties and for royalty amounts in excess of the minimum guarantee  the company records commission revenue based upon its share of earned royalties from the sales of the related products 
television  film and video productions through the company s wholly owned subsidiary  kids productions  inc  the company accounts for its activities associated with the production of entertainment programming in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting by producers or distributors of films which superceded financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 financial reporting by producers and distributors of motion picture films 
the sop establishes  among other things  how an entity should recognize revenue from a sale or licensing arrangement of a film 
this sop is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this sop did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial position of the company 
under sop  the company capitalizes costs associated with each individual production and such costs are classified as non current assets 
such costs are amortized against the related revenue as such revenue is recognized 
in determining amortization rates  the company must make estimates of future expected revenue from various sources including domestic television broadcasts  international television broadcasts  home video sales and licensing revenues from products related to the television programs 
while the company believes its estimates are reasonable  future amortization rates may change as a result of changes in estimated future revenues from such films 
periodically  the company evaluates the anticipated future revenue of such films produced by the company against the net realizable value of the capitalized film costs and  where appropriate  the company reduces the carrying value of such film costs to their estimated net realizable amount 
any reduction in the carrying value of capitalized film costs would result in a corresponding charge to earnings 
media buying  planning and distribution services through the company s wholly owned subsidiary  the summit media group  inc summit media  the company provides media planning and buying services for both print and broadcast 
summit media is compensated based on a percentage of the media it places 
such revenue is recognized at the time the related media runs 
summit media also provides television distribution services for which it receives a fee based on a percentage of the license fee paid by the broadcaster or  in the case of syndicated programming  a percentage of the advertising sales generated by the related program 
such revenue is recognized at the time the distribution services are completed and the license fee or the advertising sales of the related program are reasonably known 
summit media will reflect a liability for media payable and a corresponding receivable from its clients in circumstances where summit media assumes the payment obligation for advertising media commitments 
fox broadcast license agreement in january  the company entered into a multi year agreement with fox to lease the television network s saturday morning four hour programming block 
beginning with the september broadcast year  the company will provide all programming content for fox s saturday morning broadcast block  which airs from am to pm et pt am to am ct 
under the terms of the agreement  the company will also have the right to retain all revenue from network advertising sales during the four hour time period 
the agreement has an initial term of four broadcast years 
the company will have an option to extend the term for up to two additional broadcast years 
the company will pay a license fee of approximately million for each broadcast year during the initial term of the agreement 
the agreement provides for of the fee for the first broadcast season to be paid on execution of the agreement  which occurred in january  with the balance of the fee for the first broadcast season to be paid in four equal installments in september  december  february and april of the broadcast year which begins in september 
fees for each subsequent broadcast year are payable in the june preceding the beginning of the broadcast year with the balance of the fee for the broadcast year payable in four equal installments in september  december  february and april 
the agreement further provides that  at the company s option  up to million of each year s fee may be paid in the company s common stock 
over the initial four year term of the agreement  the company will pay fox aggregate license fees of  the company s ability to recover the cost of its license fees payable to fox will depend on the popularity of the television programs the company runs and the general market demand for and pricing of advertising time for saturday morning children s broadcast television 
the popularity of such programs impacts audience levels and the value of the network advertising rates the company can charge 
additionally  the success of merchandise licensing programs and home video sales based on such television programs is dependent on consumer acceptance of the properties 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient future revenue from advertising sales  home video sales and merchandising licensing at levels to cover the cost of its contractual obligation to fox broadcasting  it would record a charge to earnings to reflect a write down in the future value of the fox license agreement in the period in which the deficiency or factors affecting the recoverability of the license fee payable become known 
the company will be required to make certain assumptions and estimates about future events such as advertising rates and audience viewing levels in evaluating its ability to recover the cost of the fox license fee 
such estimates and assumptions are subject to market forces and factors beyond the control of the company and inherently subject to change 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recover the full cost of the fox license fee and in the event it cannot  the resulting charges to reflect a write down in the future value of the fox license fee could be significant
