the results of operations for the acquired businesses are included from the dates of acquisition in the consolidated financial statements 
amounts recorded as excess of the purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired ie  goodwill are included in acquisition intangibles in the consolidated balance sheets 
consolidated results of operations for the years ended  or would not have been materially different if any of the acquisitions had occurred on january of the respective preceding years 
accordingly  pro forma sales  net earnings and earnings per share disclosures have not been provided 
in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas addresses the accounting and reporting requirements for legally unavoidable obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
in general  sfas requires entities to capitalize asset retirement costs of related long lived assets in the period in which they meet the definition of a liability and to allocate those costs to expense using a systematic and rational method 
sfas will become effective for the company beginning january  the company is reviewing the potential impact of sfas on its consolidated results of operations and financial position  which is expected to be immaterial 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations sfas and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires business combinations consummated after june   to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
it also specifies the criteria that intangible assets must meet to be recognized apart from goodwill 
sfas requires the use of a non amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives 
under this approach  goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but instead are reviewed for impairments at least annually and written down only in the periods in which it is determined that the recorded value is greater than the fair value 
sfas also requires that intangible assets with determinable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas will become effective for the company beginning january  goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july   have been amortized through december   in accordance with the appropriate pre sfas and accounting literature 
the company has evaluated its goodwill and intangible assets using the new criteria in sfas  and as a result  certain intangibles that no longer met the criteria for recognition apart from goodwill were reclassified as goodwill effective january  the company has also re evaluated the remaining useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets with determinable useful lives and has made all necessary amortization period adjustments effective january  the company s acquisition intangibles  net of accumulated amortization  before and after such reclassifications were as follows goodwill intangibles total before reclassifications water and industrial process chemicals performance products specialty materials building block chemicals total after reclassifications water and industrial process chemicals performance products specialty materials building block chemicals total in connection with the transitional goodwill impairment test  sfas requires the company to assess whether there is any indication that goodwill is impaired as of january  to accomplish this  the company has defined its business segments as its sfas reporting units and has determined the carrying value of those reporting units as of january  the company has until june   to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying value 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired  and the company must then perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  the company must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  to its carrying value 
this second step  if required  must be completed by december   and any transitional impairment loss will be measured as of january   and recognized as the effect of a change in accounting principle 
although further evaluation is still needed to complete the transitional goodwill impairment test provisions of sfas  the company does not currently believe that adoption of the new standards will result in a material charge to earnings 
overall  these new standards will have the impact of reducing amortization expense 
however  future annual impairment reviews may result in future write downs 
amortization expense related to goodwill and intangible assets  which was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively  is expected to be approximately for the year ending december   based on intangible assets existing at january   with the segment breakdown as follows water and industrial process chemicals   performance products  and specialty materials  the change in amortization expense related to the adjustment of remaining useful lives and residual values was immaterial 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
in general under sfas  as amended  all derivative instruments must be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
sfas also establishes accounting standards for reporting changes in the fair value of derivative instruments 
if a derivative is deemed to be an effective hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative will be either offset against changes in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized on an after tax basis in accumulated other comprehensive income within the equity section of the balance sheet until such time that the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting as well as the ineffective portion of hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings 
under certain exceptions  sfas permits derivative instruments to be accounted for as executory contracts because physical delivery of the underlying commodity is probable 
in those circumstances  sfas does not require derivative instruments to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of sfas on the company s derivative accounting policies 
the american institute of certified public accountants has issued a proposed statement of position sop  accounting for certain costs and activities related to property  plant and equipment 
if enacted  this sop would  among other things  require the company to change its method of depreciation 
the company primarily utilizes the composite method of depreciation in the united states and canada  applied on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of various classes of assets 
under the composite method  depreciation is taken on the class of asset as a whole rather than on an individual asset basis 
depreciation continues until the entire asset class is fully depreciated 
upon disposition or retirement  the cost of such assets plus demolition costs less amounts realized on sale or salvage  is charged or credited to the accumulated depreciation account 
the company is evaluating the impact of the proposed sop 
if enacted  excluding any cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  it is expected that depreciation expense will decrease as depreciation on individual assets will cease as such assets are fully depreciated 
on the other hand  upon disposition or retirement of assets  the net book value of such assets plus demolition costs less amounts realized from sale or salvage  will be charged or credited to earnings

sales were favorably impacted by a sharp increase in acrylonitrile and acrylamide selling prices  although higher propylene and natural gas costs more than offset the selling price increases 
earnings from operations were favorably impacted by two major factors 
first  improved plant operations led to significantly higher production volumes of acrylonitrile  thereby reducing manufacturing cost per unit 
this in turn improved the overall gross profit of the segment 
the second factor was reduced plant spending

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about the company s potential exposures to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  interest rates and equity price changes 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in this forward looking analysis 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to various market risks  including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
to manage the exposure related to these risks  the company may engage in various derivative transactions in accordance with company established policies 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
moreover  the company enters into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly rated counterparties and makes reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties  thereby limiting exposure to credit and performance related risks 
foreign exchange rate risk the risk of adverse exchange rate fluctuations is mitigated by the fact that there is no concentration of foreign currency exposure 
in addition  the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts primarily to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
at december   the principal transactions hedged were accounts receivable  accounts payable and inter company loans denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the business 
the company s practice is to hedge foreign currency exposures with foreign exchange forward contracts denominated in the same currency and with similar critical terms as the underlying exposure  and therefore  the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value  cash flows or future earnings of the hedged item or transaction 
foreign exchange forward contracts are reported as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet with changes in their fair value recorded in other income  net  together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability 
at december   the company had net foreign exchange contracts to purchase an aggregate of euros  british pounds and norwegian krone for us dollars 
the company also had net contracts for the following us dollar equivalent aggregate amounts contracts to purchase norwegian krone for other european currencies  primarily british pounds  contracts to purchase british pounds for euros  contracts to purchase norwegian krone for euros and contracts to sell of other currencies for euros 
the fair value of foreign exchange contracts  based on forward exchange rates at december   exceeded contract values by approximately assuming that year end exchange rates between the underlying currencies of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts and the various hedged currencies were to adversely change by a hypothetical  the change in the fair value of all outstanding contracts at year end would be a decrease of approximately however  since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged 
commodity price risk the company selectively utilizes natural gas forward contracts to hedge its exposure to price risk associated with the purchase of natural gas primarily for utility purposes 
the maturity of these contracts correlate highly to the actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect of securing predetermined prices that the company pays for the underlying commodity 
while these contracts are structured to limit the company s exposure to increases in commodity prices  they can also limit the potential benefit the company might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices 
because the company takes actual delivery of the physical commodity  natural gas forward contracts are not required to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value  instead realized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the cost of the commodity upon settlement of the contract 
to the extent that the company s strategy for managing commodity price risk changes  including the use of financially settled derivative instruments  the accounting methods used to record those transactions may differ from the policies described above 
at december   the company had notional value of natural gas forward contracts with january through october   delivery dates outstanding 
based on year end nymex prices  the company had a net unrealized loss of assuming that year end prices were to adversely change by a hypothetical  the incremental increase in cost of goods sold would be approximately interest rate risk at december   the financial liabilities of the company consisted primarily of fixed rate long term debt  which had a carrying value of  a principal balance of and a fair value  based on dealer quoted values  of approximately assuming other factors are held constant  interest rate changes generally affect the fair value of fixed rate debt  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
accordingly  assuming a hypothetical increase of in interest rates and all other variables were to remain constant  interest expense would not change  and the fair market value of the fixed rate long term debt would decrease approximately equity price risk in connection with the company s stock repurchase program  the company selectively utilizes freestanding put option contracts that are indexed to the company s stock and entitle the holder to sell shares of the company s common stock to the company at specified exercise prices 
in lieu of purchasing the shares from the put option holders  the company has the right to elect settlement by paying the holders of the put options the excess of the strike price over the then market price of the shares in either cash or shares of the company s common stock ie  net cash or net share settlement 
the put option contracts are initially measured at fair value and reported in stockholders equity 
subsequent changes in fair value are not recognized in the financial statements 
at december   there were no put options outstanding 
other outlook in its january   earnings press release  the company set forth its assumptions and management s best current estimate of first quarter and full year earnings at that time 
the company stated that  overall it expected first quarter net earnings to be in the range of to per diluted share  which includes approximately as a result of applying sfas and  and full year net earnings to be in the range of to per diluted share  which includes approximately as a result of applying sfas and although management believes that the january   earnings projections  as well as the analysis on which it was based  continues to reflect the current thinking of management  there can be no assurance that sales or earnings will develop in the manner projected or if the analysis were to be redone on the date hereof there would be no change to the outlook 
actual results may differ materially 
fourth quarter results reflected a global economy in recession and low levels of industrial chemicals production 
overall  the company expects these conditions to continue in and believes some markets  such as the automotive industry  may experience further declines 
in addition  it expects the us dollar to continue strengthening through  thereby reducing specialty chemicals water and industrial process chemicals and performance products international sales by about one percent 
furthermore  in the specialty materials segment  a significant reduction in airline passenger traffic has led to excess capacity and a deterioration in the financial condition of the airline industry 
the company expects a significant reduction in demand from the large commercial aircraft sector in with some continuing decline in demand for  reducing sales of specialty materials aerospace materials 
in the water and industrial process chemicals segment  sales are expected to be flat when compared to sales 
increased sales to the municipal and industrial markets should slightly offset lower demand for waste treatment chemicals from the paper and the oil sectors  which have reduced capacity 
the company expects demand for mining chemicals to decline in  reflecting weak global economic conditions and high inventories of aluminum and copper 
however  the company expects to benefit from penetration into new mining applications and the continuing growth of the phosphine chemicals business 
lower raw material costs and new  more cost effective capacity in europe and the united states are expected to enhance operating margins 
as a result  the company expects this segment to achieve flat sales and a single digit percentage increase in operating earnings in  compared with in the performance products segment  soft economic conditions are expected to impact sales to the plastics  automotive  housing and general industrial markets 
the weak economic conditions are creating downward price pressure in the polymer additives sector  particularly from global and asian suppliers 
however  lower raw material costs and operational excellence initiatives are expected to increase the operating margins of this segment 
as a result  the company expects sales to be relatively flat to slightly down in with a significant increase in operating earnings compared with results 
in the specialty materials segment  sales to the plus passenger seat commercial airliner sector are expected to be down sharply in  based on the commercial airliner delivery schedules published by boeing and airbus 
the company expects a smaller reduction in sales to the regional jet and aircraft brake markets 
sales to business and military aircraft  satellite and launch vehicles and high performance markets should continue to grow in overall  sales in the specialty materials segment are expected to be to lower  with operating earnings to lower  compared with in the building block chemicals segment  weak economic conditions are expected to reduce demand for acrylonitrile and its co products in the company expects to operate its fortier plant at a reduced utilization rate 
despite some plant shutdowns  however  the supply of acrylonitrile is expected to continue to exceed demand  continuing the trend of lower acrylonitrile selling prices partially offset by lower raw material costs  resulting in tight spreads 
the company does  however  expect the building block chemicals segment to benefit from significantly lower energy and raw material costs in and to realize the full year benefits of the fortier plant restructuring that was initiated in the second quarter of as a result  the building block chemicals segment is expected to post a moderate operating loss in  compared with a operating loss in significant accounting estimates accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the notes thereto 
the areas discussed below involve the use of significant judgment in the preparation of the company s financial statements and changes in the estimates and assumptions used may impact future results of operations and financial condition 
environmental it is the company s policy to accrue  and charge against earnings  environmental cleanup costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount is reasonably estimable 
as assessments and cleanups proceed  these accruals are reviewed periodically and adjusted  if necessary  as additional information becomes available 
these accruals can change substantially due to such factors as additional information on the nature or extent of contamination  methods of remediation required  changes in the apportionment of costs among responsible parties and other actions by governmental agencies or private parties 
cash expenditures often lag behind the period in which an accrual is recorded by a number of years 
postretirement benefits the company sponsors postretirement benefit plans 
the postretirement plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements 
the accrued postretirement benefit cost at december  and  includes in accrued expenses and and  respectively  in other noncurrent liabilities 
the key determinants of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations apbo are discount rate  expected return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rate 
the healthcare cost trend rate has a significant effect on the reported amounts of apbo and related expense 
for example  increasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would increase the apbo at december   and the aggregate service and interest cost by approximately and  respectively  and decreasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would decrease the apbo at december  and the aggregate service and interest cost by approximately and  respectively 
for further information  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and further discussions included in this management s discussion and analysis 
impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of long lived assets and intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets and would be charged to earnings 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell 
several estimates are made when reviewing for impairments such as market and revenue growth  cost estimates and technological changes 
these factors are reviewed annually 
for goodwill  beginning in the company will applysfas  which requires that goodwill be reviewed for impairments at least annually and written down in the periods in which it is determined that the recorded value is greater than the fair value 
to accomplish this  the company has to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying value 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and the company must then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  to its carrying value
