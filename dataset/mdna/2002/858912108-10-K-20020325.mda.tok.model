background we were incorporated in march we provide regulated medical waste collection  transportation and treatment services to our customers and related training and education programs and consulting services 
we also sell ancillary supplies and transport pharmaceuticals  photographic chemicals  lead foil and amalgam for recycling in selected geographic service areas 
we are also expanding into international markets through joint ventures or by licensing our proprietary technology and selling associated equipment 
our revenues have increased from million in to million in we derive our revenues from services to two principal types of customers i outpatient clinics  medical and dental offices  biomedical companies  municipal entities  long term and sub acute care facilities and other smaller quantity generators of regulated medical waste small account customers and ii hospitals  blood banks  pharmaceutical manufacturers and other larger quantity generators of regulated medical waste large account customers 
substantially all of our services are provided pursuant to customer contracts specifying either scheduled or on call regulated medical waste management services  or both 
contracts with small account customers generally provide for annual price increases and have an automatic renewal provision unless the customer notifies us prior to completion of the contract 
contracts with hospitals and other large account customers  which may run for more than one year  typically include price escalator provisions  which allow for price increases generally tied to an inflation index or set at a fixed percentage 
as of december   we served over  customers 
critical accounting policies and procedures our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment on our part and complexity of reporting 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified among uncollected accounts 
no single customer accounts for more than of our revenues 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue at the time of medical waste collection 
revenue and costs on contracts to supply our proprietary treatment equipment are accounted for by the percentage of completion method  whereby income is recognized based on the estimated stage of completion of the individual contract using the cost to cost method 
we routinely review total estimated costs to complete each contract and revise the estimated gross margin on the contract as necessary 
payments received in advance are deferred and recognized over the related service period 
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and other identifiable intangible assets  such as assembled workforce and covenants not to compete  are currently amortized on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
these assets are currently reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable see note to the consolidated financial statements 
insurance 
our insurance for worker s compensation  vehicle liability and physical damage  and employee related health care benefits are covered using high deductible insurance polices 
a third party administrator is used to process all such claims 
we require all worker s compensation claims to be reported within hours 
as a result  we accrue our worker s compensation liability based upon the claim reserves established by the third party administrator each month 
our employee health insurance benefit liability is based on our historical claims experience rate 
to the extent actual claims vary from historical experience  our earnings would be impacted 
we review our accruals associated with the exposure to these liabilities for adequacy at the end of each reporting period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risks arising from changes in interest rates on our senior secured credit facility 
our interest rate exposure results from changes in libor or the base rate which are used to determine the applicable interest rates under our term loans and revolving credit facility 
our potential loss over one year that would result from a hypothetical  instantaneous and unfavorable change of basis points in the interest rate on all of our variable rate obligations would be approximately million 
fluctuations in interest rates will not affect the interest payable on our senior subordinated notes  which is fixed 
we have entered into interest rate swap collar agreements that effectively convert a portion of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis for the next two years  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense 
approximately million of our outstanding variable rate debt was covered by interest rate swap collar agreements at december  the differential to be paid or received is accrued monthly as an adjustment to interest expense
