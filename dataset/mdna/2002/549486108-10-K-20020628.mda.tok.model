item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations general the company s conventional cheese products  which account for substantially all of the company s sales  are commodity items 
the company prices its conventional cheese products competitively with others in the industry  which pricing  since may  is referenced to the chicago mercantile exchange and was formerly referenced to the wisconsin block cheddar market 
the price the company pays for fluid milk  a significant component of cost of goods sold  is not determined until the month after its cheese has been sold 
regulatory factors effecting our milk suppliers such as dairy subsidies and price supports may have an effect on our raw material costs  but that impact can not be predicted 
milk is generally sold above the subsidy price  which is established by government regulation 
the subsidy price generally establishes a floor for such costs 
while the company generally can anticipate a change in price of milk  it cannot anticipate the extent thereof 
there is no corresponding floor on the commodity mercantile exchange block cheddar price 
therefore  if the block cheddar price to which our selling price is referenced changes at a different rate than the price of milk our margins are affected accordingly 
by virtue of the pricing structure for its cheese and the delay in the determination of cost  the company cannot pass along to the customer the changes in the cost of milk in the price of its conventional cheese 
as a consequence thereof  the company s gross profit margin for such cheese is subject to fluctuation  which fluctuation  however slight  can have a significant effect on profitability 
the company is unable to predict any future increase or decrease in the prices in the chicago mercantile exchange as such markets are subject to fluctuation based on factors and commodity markets outside of the control of the company 
although the cost of fluid milk does tend to move correspondingly with the chicago mercantile exchange  the extent of such movement and the timing thereof is not predictable as it is subject to government control and support 
as a result of these factors  the company is unable to predict pricing trends 
year ended march  compared to the year ended march  sales for the year ended march  increased to  from  for the comparable period in  an increase of  or 
approximately  or of such amount was offset by a decrease in the number of pounds of cheese sold 
approximately  or of such increase was due to a increase in the average selling price for cheese 
the volume decrease was due to decreased demand in the commodity cheese markets 
due to the weak cheese markets  the company anticipates volume decreases and decreased demand in the months ahead  although there can be no assurance in this regard 
the increase in average selling price was the result of an increase in the block cheddar market prices resulting in a higher selling price per pound of cheese 
of the  sales increase this period  approximately  or represented increased whey sales produced in our new facility
