item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly in risk factors 
see business cautionary statements regarding forward looking statements 
the following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer downtime credits and incentives  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of investments and property  plant  and equipment  restructuring  long term service contracts and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
overview we are a leading provider of managed internet services for corporations and government agencies that operate mission critical internet applications 
we deliver our services using our proprietary opsware automation technology  which automates formerly manual tasks  such as provisioning and managing a customer s internet operations  thereby reducing the amount of manual intervention required 
our managed internet services allow customers to outsource the deployment  configuration  hosting  management and support of their internet applications and web sites in a cost effective and highly flexible manner 
our services enable customers to increase or reduce their internet operations capacity as business needs dictate  without having to undertake the difficulty and expense associated with building the required operations expertise in house 
we were founded in september from inception through january  we developed our initial service offerings  hired employees and began to market our services 
we deployed our first customer in february our customers purchase our services through customer service agreements  which generally have terms of one to three years 
our agreements are generally renewed automatically for periods ranging from three months to one year  unless terminated prior to the expiration of the initial term 
we generally recognize revenue related to these agreements ratably over the period the managed services are provided to the respective customers 
from time to time  we may disclose our bookings for a particular quarter 
bookings over a particular period represent the prospective contract value of agreements entered into during a period from new and existing customers and other agreements for services initiated during the period 
in addition  bookings typically does not take into account any decreases in contracts previously booked 
the extent to which revenue is generated from bookings depends on a number of factors such as customer churn  service credits in case of outages  deployment timing  contract renegotiation  early termination and  in certain cases  further specification of projects by our customers 
in addition  our customer agreements are subject to standard termination provisions  including breach or insolvency by either party to the agreement 
finally  customers ability to pay the contractually agreed upon amounts could become limited in the future based on their operating results  in which case we would not ultimately recognize revenue related to those customers 
also  from time to time  we may disclose information related to customer churn  which means the loss of revenue from both contract terminations and reductions in the size of contracts 
the amount of revenue we ultimately realize under these agreements may be less than the prospective contract value of these agreements and cannot be derived from bookings 
although we disclose bookings from time to time  we will not update any such disclosures after the date upon which they are made to conform such disclosures to actual results or changes  except as required by law 
cost of revenue consists primarily of payments on rental equipment  salaries and related personnel expenses of our employees who provide services to our customers  leases of data center space in third party facilities  customer support services  including network monitoring and support  and depreciation and amortization of capitalized equipment and software 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses and depreciation and amortization of purchased equipment and software 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related personnel expenses  as well as advertising  trade shows and promotional expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits of our administrative personnel and fees for outside professional services 
we intend to continue to invest in research and development and new technologies to develop new services and further advance our offerings 
in february  we entered into a marketing alliance agreement with accenture 
accenture is entitled to receive marketing assistance fees and has been issued a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock 
warrants issued to accenture vest contingently 
a specified number of warrants fully vest and become immediately exercisable and non forfeitable upon the signing of a contract between us and a new customer referred to us by accenture 
the warrants can be earned through the termination of the agreement in february  and vested warrants expire on february  we will record the fair value of each warrant as it vests using the black scholes pricing model 
a significant factor in the black scholes pricing model will be the fair value of our stock when the warrants vest compared to the exercise price 
the exercise price is 
the fair value of the warrants that vest upon the signing of a customer s contract will be amortized into operating expenses marketing expenses over the life of the contract between the customer and us 
to date  no warrants have vested 
in addition  upon the signing of a contract between us and a customer referred from accenture  accenture is entitled to receive marketing assistance fees  payable monthly  based on a percentage of amounts payable to us under the contract 
the marketing assistance fees will be recognized monthly by us based on the fees due accenture 
to date  no marketing assistance fees have been paid 
we believe that the sales and marketing alliance agreement could result in significant stock based compensation 
accenture stock based and cash compensation will be disclosed on a separate line in operating expenses marketing expenses 
in may  we announced a restructuring program to improve utilization of our existing technology and infrastructure 
this restructuring program included a worldwide workforce reduction  consolidation of the resulting excess facilities and a provision for excess and obsolete property and equipment 
as a result of the restructuring program  we recorded restructuring costs of million classified as operating expenses 
in september  we announced an organizational realignment intended to increase operational efficiencies  reduce costs and reduce our cash needs 
this organizational realignment included hiring in some key areas and the elimination of some positions 
as a result of the organization realignment  we recorded restructuring costs of million which were included in operating expenses 
in february  we entered into an agreement to acquire frontera corporation  a privately held managed services provider located in southern california  for consideration consisting solely of our common stock 
the acquisition is valued at approximately million to million 
the closing of the acquisition is expected to occur in the second quarter of fiscal and is subject to customary closing conditions  including frontera stockholder approval and regulatory approvals 
if the acquisition closes  we expect to acquire approximately million of cash 
results of operations the following table sets forth consolidated statements of operations data for the fiscal years ended january  and and for the period from inception september  to january  this information has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements 
this information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the operating results for any period are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
year ended january  period from inception september  to january  in thousands  except per share amounts consolidated statements of operations data net revenue costs and expenses cost of revenue research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring costs amortization of deferred stock compensation total costs and expenses loss from operations interest and other income interest and other expense net loss series c convertible preferred stock deemed non cash dividend net loss applicable to common stockholders excludes amortization of deferred stock compensation of the following cost of revenue research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total amortization of deferred stock compensation net revenue 
net revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we did not generate any revenue during the period from inception to january  net revenue increased as a result of the deployment of our services to new and existing customers and increased demand for our services 
in the fiscal year ended january   nike accounted for of our net revenue and atriax accounted for of our net revenue 
on april   atriax announced that it would cease operations within a short period of time 
as a result  we do not expect to derive any revenue from atriax beyond the first quarter of fiscal  and our net revenue  cash flows and results of operations will suffer if we are unable to replace the lost revenue from atriax 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased in absolute dollars  but decreased as a percentage of net revenue  to million  or of net revenue  in fiscal from million  or of net revenue  in fiscal we did not have cost of revenue during the period from inception to january   as we did not generate revenue during that period 
cost of revenue increased as a result of renting equipment and depreciating and amortizing purchased equipment and software to meet customer demand 
in addition  cost of revenue increased due to our lease of additional third party data center space 
we expect that our cost of revenue will decrease as a percentage of net revenue in the next fiscal year as we utilize our existing infrastructure to support and deploy new and existing customers 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars  but decreased as a percentage of net revenue  to million  or of net revenue  in fiscal from million  or of net revenue  in fiscal research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million during the period from inception to january  research and development expenses increased in both years primarily as a result of an increase in related employee headcount  the rental of equipment  the depreciation of purchased equipment used in the potential development of new service offerings and a million non cash stock compensation charge recognized during the year ended january  for options issued to a consultant 
we expect that our research and development costs will remain relatively constant in absolute dollars over the next fiscal year 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased in absolute dollars  but decreased as a percentage of net revenue  to million  or of net revenue  in fiscal from million  or of net revenue  in fiscal sales and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal from  during the period from inception to january  sales and marketing expenses increased in both years primarily as a result of an increase in related employee headcount  commissions paid on sales to customers  the opening of additional field offices to support our direct sales force and promotional expenses 
we believe that continued investment in sales and marketing is critical to obtaining additional revenue  and  as a result  expect these expenses to increase somewhat in absolute dollars in the next fiscal year 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars  but decreased as a percentage of net revenue  to million  or of net revenue  in fiscal from million  or of net revenue  in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from  during the period from inception to january  general and administrative expenses increased in both years primarily as a result of increases in administrative and management personnel and expenses necessary to support and scale our operations 
the general and administrative expenses also reflected increased outside professional advisor costs and the costs associated with being a public company 
we expect that our general and administrative costs will decrease slightly in absolute dollars in the next fiscal year 
restructuring costs 
in may and september  we announced a restructuring program and an organizational realignment to improve utilization of our existing technology and infrastructure 
the restructuring program in may included a worldwide workforce reduction  consolidation of the resulting excess facilities and an accrual for excess and obsolete equipment 
as a result of the restructuring program  we recorded restructuring costs of million classified as operating expenses in the quarter ended july  included in the million was a noncash charge of million related to the acceleration of stock options for certain employees 
the organizational realignment in september included hiring in key areas  such as direct sales representatives and specific technology positions  and the elimination of some other positions 
as a result of the organizational realignment  we recorded a reorganization charge of million related to the elimination of some positions  which was included in operating expense in the quarter ended october  for a further discussion of our restructuring activities  please see footnote  restructuring costs  in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal stock based compensation increased to million in fiscal from million during the period from inception to january  the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was partly due to a reversal of million of deferred compensation associated with the termination of employees who have not vested in the underlying shares in connection with the restructuring and reorganization initiatives taken in may and september also  amortization of stock based compensation decreases each year due to the fact that we use the graded vesting method 
the increase in fiscal from was due primarily to the amortization of expenses related to our grants of stock purchase rights and options with exercise prices below the deemed fair value of our common stock 
we expect stock based compensation expense to decrease in the next fiscal year as compared to this fiscal year 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income expense  net  increased to an expense of million in fiscal from an expense of million in fiscal interest and other income expense  net  decreased to an expense of million in fiscal from an income of  during the period from inception to january  the increase in fiscal from fiscal was due primarily to interest related to the senior discount notes combined with the relatively constant interest and other income earned primarily on proceeds from our initial public offering 
the decrease in fiscal from the period from inception to january  was due primarily to the accretion on senior discount notes partially offset by the investment interest income earned on proceeds from our series c preferred stock issuance in june provision for income taxes 
we have incurred losses for both income tax and financial statement purposes for all periods presented 
accordingly  no provision for income taxes has been recorded 
as of january   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and state net operating loss carryforwards of million available to offset future taxable income  which may be used  subject to limitations  to offset future state and federal taxable income through and  respectively 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against the entire net operating loss carry forwards because of the uncertainty that we will be able to realize the benefit of the net operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
deemed  non cash dividend 
we recorded a million non cash dividend in the year ended january  due to the beneficial conversion feature in the series c convertible preferred stock because of the difference between the deemed fair value at the date of issuance and actual issuance price 
in june  we sold approximately million shares of series c preferred stock to new and existing investors for a total purchase price of million in order to raise funds to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the private placement of our preferred stock  sale of our senior discount notes  our initial public offering and  to a lesser extent  operating equipment lease financing  customer revenue and capital equipment lease financing 
as of january   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and temporarily restricted cash 
on march   we received approximately million in net cash proceeds from the sale of our common stock in an initial public offering and a private placement to compaq 
net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash provided by operating activities was million for the period from inception to january  net cash used in operating activities for the year ended january   was primarily the result of a net loss  offset by non cash stock compensation expense  depreciation and amortization and the accretion on the senior discount notes  an increase in deferred revenue  accrued restructuring charges and other accrued liabilities  offset by increases in accounts receivable and decreases in prepaids  other current assets  other assets and accounts payable 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended january   was primarily the result of a net loss  offset by non cash stock compensation expense and depreciation and amortization  an increase in accounts receivable  prepaids and other current assets  partially offset by increases in accounts payable  deferred revenue  other accrued liabilities and accrued compensation 
net cash provided by operating activities for the period from inception to january   was primarily attributable to the increase in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenue partially offset by the net loss for the period 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million for the period from inception to january  net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of investments in capital equipment  the increase in restricted cash and purchases of short term investments 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal from was the result of lower capital expenditures and the maturities and sales of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million for the period from inception to january  in fiscal  cash received was from the completion of our initial public offering  the payments of notes receivable and the exercise of stock options 
in fiscal and the period from inception to january   cash received was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock 
in the year ended january   we also received net proceeds from the sale of senior discount notes 
we have an aggregate of million available under equipment lease credit facilities as of january  under the equipment lease credit facilities  we are entitled to lease equipment with payment terms extending to months 
amounts outstanding under these facilities bear effective rates of interest ranging from approximately to and are secured by the related leased assets 
as of january   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under senior discount notes and operating and capital leases 
payments under our senior discount notes begin in august and will continue until the notes are paid in full in february the following summarizes our contractual obligations at january   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years greater than years capital leases operating leases senior discount notes total contractual cash obligations as of january   the carrying value of our senior discount notes was approximately million 
we believe that our current cash balances  including cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  including cash needed to fund any expenses in connection with the frontera acquisition  for at least the next months 
nevertheless  we may seek additional capital through private equity  equipment lease facilities or bank financings 
capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of sales growth  market acceptance of our services  costs of providing our services  the timing and extent of research and development projects and increases in our operating expenses 
to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents balances and any cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available if necessary or available on reasonable terms 
in addition  although there are no present understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisition of other businesses  services  products and technologies  other than our agreement to acquire frontera corporation  we may from time to time evaluate potential acquisitions  which could increase our capital requirements 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  property and equipment  impairment of long lived assets and restructuring 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue 
we recognize revenue ratably over the managed services contract period as services are fulfilled  provided we have evidence of an agreement  the price of the services is fixed or determinable  all contracted services are being delivered and payment is reasonably assured 
we assess the probability of collection by reviewing our customers payment history  financial condition and credit report 
if the probability of collection is unreasonable  revenue is deferred until the payment is collected 
when obligations remain after services are delivered  revenue is only recognized after such obligations are fulfilled 
in addition to the sale of managed services  we generate revenue from short term professional service agreements 
revenue from professional services is recognized as work is completed and accepted by the customer 
amounts billed and or cash received in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets 
some of our customers are obligated to pay incremental fees once we have fulfilled our readiness obligations by preparing the internet infrastructure if those customers are not ready to launch the site 
the incremental fees begin a defined period of time after the operational date and end on the launch date 
the managed service period begins on the launch of the site  and thus the length of time or fees charged between the operational date and launch date do not affect the fees charged during the managed service period 
we recognize revenue between the operation date and launch date  as such period represents a separate and distinct earnings process  provided we have evidence of an agreement  the price is fixed or determinable  we have fulfilled our readiness obligations and collectibility is reasonably assured 
if the period between the operational date and the launch date extends beyond a reasonable amount of time  we assess the likelihood of a customer s willingness to continue payments during this period by understanding the reasons causing the extended operational period 
we understand the reasons through discussions with the customers and the service teams 
revenue is not recognized until we can reasonably expect payment 
we reduce revenue for credits given for estimated unscheduled downtime on a monthly basis 
according to our accounting policy and customer contracts  the revenue credits are based on the cause of downtime  the length of the downtime and the customer s monthly price of the services 
the estimated credit reduces revenue in the month in which the unscheduled downtime occurs 
if our original estimate of the cause or length of downtime is other than or less than the actual results  revenue could be negatively impacted in future periods 
in addition to the service credits  we may on occasion issue credits for events that are outside of the contractual service level agreements 
these types of credits have not been significant in the past 
our processes for estimating these types of credits include analyzing our historical experiences with such credits and comparing them to events that occur in the current month 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on specifically identified customers and as a percentage of the accounts receivable balance 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in addition  under our accounting policy  we continually assess the balance of our allowance for doubtful accounts based on  among other things  our customers payment history and financial condition  including a review of the customers balance sheets  statements of operations  statements of cash flows and credit reports 
we also discuss each customer with our service teams and determine if any service level issues or the customer s financial status could affect collectibility 
if actual write offs were greater than our estimates  we would increase our allowance for doubtful accounts  which would increase our bad debt expense 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from approximately two to five years or the applicable lease term  if shorter 
reviews are regularly performed to determine whether facts or circumstances exist which indicate the useful life is shorter than originally estimated or the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
impairment of long lived assets 
we continually review the carrying value of long lived assets  including property and equipment to determine whether there are any indications of impairment losses 
according to our accounting policy  we compare the estimated future net cash flows to be generated from our customers to the carrying value of the long lived assets 
our review includes estimating new contract bookings  contract renewals  percent of customers who will buy their own hardware and software and percent of customer churn 
we reduce the carrying value of the long lived assets if the carrying value of the long lived assets is greater than the estimated future net cash flow 
restructuring 
during  we restructured the company under plans approved by the board of directors by reducing our headcount and consolidating our facilities utilization 
as a result of these actions  we recorded restructuring and other related charges consisting of cash severance payments to be made to severed employees and lease payments related to property abandoned as a result of our facilities consolidation 
we are in the process of trying to sublet non cancelable leased facilities that we have vacated 
if the length of time before we find tenants for these facilities or the market rental rates differ significantly from our estimates  our actual costs will differ from the charge that was initially recorded 
our estimates include the review of the financial condition of our existing sublessees as well as the state of the regional real estate markets 
each reporting period  we will review these estimates based on the status of execution of our restructuring plan and  to the extent that these assumptions change due to changes in market conditions and our business  the ultimate restructuring expenses could vary by material amounts 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations  and no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas supersedes apb opinion no 
 business combinations  and eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations  thus requiring that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method 
the requirements of sfas apply to all business combinations initiated after june  sfas supersedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets  and provides that goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life will no longer be amortized 
however  these assets must be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
sfas applies to all business combinations completed after june  we did not enter into any business combinations prior to january  we will adopt sfas and effective as of february  and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which applies to financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas supersedes fasb statement  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and portions of apb opinion  reporting the results of operations 
sfas provides a single accounting model for long lived assets we expect to dispose of and significantly changes the criteria for classifying an asset as held for sale 
this classification is important because held for sale assets are not depreciated and are stated at the lower of fair value or carrying amount 
sfas also requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in the period s in which the losses are actually incurred  rather than when the amount of the loss is estimated  as presently required 
we will adopt sfas effective as of february  and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf released issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s product  which applies to annual or interim financial statement periods beginning after december  the release provides that cash consideration including sales incentives that we give to our customers or resellers should be accounted for as a reduction of revenue unless we receive a benefit that is identifiable and that can be reasonably estimated 
we will adopt this new release effective as of february  and do not expect that the adoption of eitf issue no 
will have a material impact on our total net revenue 
risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
we have a limited operating history  and our business model is new and unproven  which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects 
we were incorporated in september and deployed our first customer in february accordingly  we have a limited operating history and limited financial data upon which you may evaluate our business and prospects 
in addition  our business model to provide managed internet services is new and unproven and is likely to continue to evolve 
our potential for future profitability must be considered in light of the risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
some of these risks relate to our potential inability to sign contracts with and deploy a sufficient number of customers  particularly in light of current unfavorable economic conditions  retain our existing customers or maintain or increase the current contracted fee levels with our existing customers  particularly in light of the increased risk that these customers encounter financial difficulty or restructure their businesses to decrease their expenditures due to current unfavorable economic conditions  successfully provide high levels of service quality to our existing customers as we expand the scale of our business and reduce our cost structure  develop new service or product offerings that complement our existing offerings  extend our opsware technology to further automate and reduce the costs of many of the processes required to deploy and support our customers  extend our opsware technology to support a wide range of hardware and software to meet the needs of a large range of customers and to support operations at customer owned or leased data center facilities  acquire or license third party technologies and services that we require to deliver our services  and increase our brand awareness 
we may not successfully address these risks 
if we do not successfully address these risks  we may not realize sufficient revenues or net income to reach or sustain profitability 
we have a history of losses and expect to continue to incur significant operating losses and negative cash flow  and we may never be profitable 
we have spent significant funds to develop our current services  lease third party data center space  procure hardware  software and networking products and develop our operations  research and development and sales and marketing organizations 
we have incurred significant operating and net losses and negative cash flow and have not achieved profitability 
as of january   we had an accumulated deficit of million  which includes approximately million related to non cash deferred stock compensation and a non cash deemed dividend on series c preferred stock 
to achieve operating profitability  we will need to increase our customer base and revenue and decrease our costs per customer 
we may not be able to increase our revenue or increase our operating efficiencies in this manner 
if our revenue grows more slowly than we anticipate  if we do not increase utilization of our leased third party data center space and technology infrastructure or if our operating or capital expenses increase more than we expect  our operating results will suffer 
moreover  we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future 
consequently  it is possible that we will not achieve profitability  and even if we do achieve profitability  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
our financial results may fluctuate significantly  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our contract bookings  revenue and operating results could vary significantly from period to period 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly or decline 
important factors that could cause our quarterly and annual results to fluctuate materially include our ability to obtain new customers and retain existing customers at current contracted or increased fee levels  the timing of signing contracts with and deploying services for new and existing customers  the timing and magnitude of operating expenses and capital expenditures  costs related to the various third party technologies we incorporate into our services  utilization of our data center space and technology infrastructure  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  the amount of credits that we may be required to issue to our customers if we fail to deliver our services pursuant to our service level agreements  and accounting charges relating to warrant grants to strategic partners 
our current and future levels of operating expenses and capital expenditures are based to an extent on our growth plans and estimates of future contract bookings and revenue 
these expenditure levels are  to a large extent  fixed in the short term 
we may not be able to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected contract bookings or revenue shortfall  and any significant shortfall in contract bookings or revenue relative to planned expenditures could negatively impact our business and results of operations 
in addition  if our customer base decreases rapidly or unpredictably  we may not be able to efficiently utilize our data center space and infrastructure  which could harm our operating results 
moreover  because many of our expenses are components of our cost of revenues  our gross margins are likely to be negative for the foreseeable future 
due to these and other factors  period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our results for any one period as an indication of our future performance 
in future periods  our operating results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
if we experience a decline in revenue from any of our significant customers  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
in the fiscal year ended january   nike accounted for of our net revenue and atriax accounted for of our net revenue 
we expect customer concentration to continue for the foreseeable future 
we may be unable to retain our current customers  and we may be unable to obtain replacement or additional customers 
if we experience a decline in revenue from any of our significant customers  our results of operations in that quarter  or following quarters  could be adversely affected 
on april   atriax announced that it would cease operations within a short period of time 
as a result  we do not expect to derive any revenue from atriax beyond the first quarter of fiscal  and our net revenue  cash flows and results of operations will suffer if we are unable to replace the lost revenue from atriax 
if our contract bookings or revenues do not meet our expectations  if we encounter unforeseen expenses or if our business plan changes  our business may not be fully funded through cash flow breakeven and we may be unable to obtain additional financing 
if our contract bookings or revenues do not meet our expectations  if we encounter unforeseen expenses or if our business plan changes  we may not be fully funded through cash flow breakeven and we may require additional financing  such as debt or equity financing 
moreover  if existing or potential customers perceive that we are not fully funded or that our cash balances are otherwise inadequate to support our operations  they may choose not to purchase new or renew existing services 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms  or at all  if we need to raise additional capital in the future 
additionally  holders of any future debt instruments or preferred stock may have rights senior to those of the holders of our common stock  and any future issuance of common stock would result in dilution of existing stockholders equity interests 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all  our business and financial results may suffer 
our ability to achieve profitability will suffer if we do not successfully manage our operations 
our business has experienced rapid expansions and contractions since we were founded in september we increased our number of employees from as of january   to as of january  in may  we instituted a number of cost restructuring initiatives  which included a reduction of headcount 
as of april   we had employees 
our restructuring in may and reorganization in september resulted in charges of million and million  respectively  related to employee severance 
because we cannot predict our contract bookings and revenue with certainty  it may be necessary to do further restructurings  including further reductions in headcount  in the future to reduce spending 
we expect our business to continue to grow in terms of number of customers and number of services we offer 
there will be additional demands on our customer service  support  research and development  sales and marketing and administrative resources as we try to increase our service offerings and expand our target markets 
the strains imposed by these demands are magnified by our limited operating history 
we may not be able to successfully manage our operations 
in order to manage our operations successfully  we must improve and add to our management  financial and information systems and controls and other elements of our business process infrastructure  maintain a high level of customer service and support  and retain  train  manage and integrate our employee base effectively 
any failure by us to effectively manage our operations could be disruptive and could delay execution of our business plan and consequently harm our business 
the rates we charge for our services may decline over time  which would reduce our revenue and adversely affect our financial results 
as our business model gains acceptance and attracts the attention of additional competitors  we may experience pressure to decrease the fees for our services  which could adversely affect our revenue and our gross margin 
this pricing pressure may be exacerbated by decreases in the cost of the third party hardware and software underlying our services  which may also make it more attractive for potential customers to deploy an in house solution 
if we are unable to sell our services at acceptable prices  or if we fail to offer additional services with sufficient profit margins  our revenue growth will slow  our margins may not improve and our business and financial results will suffer 
our operating results may suffer if we fail to achieve expected benefits from strategic relationships 
we have relied on in the past  and intend to continue to form in the future  strategic relationships with other technology companies in order to obtain a broader reach for our services 
for example  we have entered into an agreement with qwest  a provider of data center and network services  pursuant to which each of us has agreed to co market and sell each other s services 
however  we cannot guarantee that a significant amount of new customer relationships or revenue will result from this agreement 
accordingly  we may not achieve any significant benefits under this agreement or similar agreements with other companies 
in addition  in the event that our strategic partners  including qwest  experience financial difficulties  we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of these relationships 
if we are unable to further diversify our customer base  a significant portion of our net revenue will continue to be derived from non enterprise customers  which could weaken our financial position 
our customers include established enterprises and non enterprise businesses 
during the fiscal year ended january   we derived approximately of our net revenue from non enterprise customers 
no single non enterprise customer accounted for more than of our net revenue during that period 
although we continue to diversify our customer base  we may not succeed 
in our experience  certain of our non enterprise customers have exhibited less financial stability and represent greater credit risks than established enterprises 
to the extent we continue to rely significantly on non enterprise customers  we will be subject to the risk that these customers encounter financial difficulties and fail to pay for our services or delay payment substantially  which would adversely affect our net revenue and other financial results 
on april   atriax announced that it would cease operations within a short period of time 
as a result  we do not expect to derive any revenue from atriax beyond the first quarter of fiscal  and our net revenue  cash flows and results of operations will suffer if we are unable to replace the lost revenue from atriax 
the managed internet services market is relatively new  and our business will suffer if the market does not develop as we expect 
the managed internet services market is relatively new and may not grow or be sustainable 
potential customers may choose not to purchase managed internet services from a third party provider due to concerns about security  reliability  cost or system availability 
it is possible that our services may never achieve broad market acceptance 
we have a limited number of customers and have deployed our services a limited number of times 
in addition  we have not yet provided our services on the scale that is anticipated in the future 
we incur operating expenses based to an extent on anticipated revenue trends that are difficult to predict given the recent emergence of the managed internet services market 
if this market does not develop  or develops more slowly than we expect  we may not achieve significant market acceptance for our services and the rate of our revenue growth may decline 
sales efforts involving large enterprises and traditional businesses involve lengthy sales and deployment cycles  which may cause our financial results to suffer 
sales to large enterprises and traditional businesses generally have a longer sales cycle than sales to internet based businesses  and the length of this sales cycle has increased in response to current economic conditions 
the resulting increase in the average sales cycle could make it more difficult for us to predict contract bookings and revenue and plan expenditures 
in addition  the time it takes to deploy our services with these accounts may be longer than a non enterprise customer  which may delay our ability to recognize revenue from sales to these accounts 
any increase in the timing of deployment could delay our profitability 
if customers require that we customize our services beyond what we currently provide or that we perform systems integration work for them  our operating results could suffer 
we generally do not customize the delivery of our services beyond the technology platforms that we currently support  and we do not provide general systems integration work for our customers 
some businesses may prefer more customized applications and services than our business model contemplates 
if we do not offer the desired customization  there may be less demand for our services 
conversely  providing customization of our services would increase our costs and could reduce our flexibility to provide broad based services to a wide range of customers 
accordingly  increased demand for customization of our services could reduce our revenue and increase our operating costs 
if our customers require service for technology platforms other than those we currently support  we may not be able to provide service to those customers or we could choose to support them  which may increase our operating expenses 
if we do choose to support additional platforms  the added complexity of our systems may increase our costs  decrease the reliability of our services and limit our ability to scale 
this may harm our ability to attract and retain customers and may delay our profitability 
we are highly dependent upon our opsware automation technology  and any failure of this technology would harm our business 
we are using and continuing to develop our opsware technology to automate formerly manual tasks in the deployment and maintenance of our customers internet infrastructure 
we rely on our opsware technology to help ensure the quality and reliability of our services and to help increase the efficiency with which we deliver our services 
our business model assumes that our opsware technology will continue to bring greater efficiencies to our operations 
the deployment cycle for our services is complex  and we may not be able to successfully utilize our opsware technology to streamline this process  which could increase our costs and harm our operating results 
moreover  if our opsware technology fails to work properly or if we are unable to continue to expand the scope of its capabilities  the quality and reliability of our services may decline  and we may be unable to grow our revenue at the rate required to sustain our business 
in addition  if we are unable to continue to increase the functionality of our opsware technology  we may not achieve anticipated efficiencies and we may need to hire additional personnel to support our customers  which would cause our cost of revenue to increase and our margins to decline 
our services depend upon the availability of leased data center space from third parties and the continued viability of those third parties 
we lease and intend to continue to lease data center space from third parties 
if we are unable to acquire new or retain existing third party data center space or if any of our third party data center providers becomes insolvent or ceases operations  our growth could be slowed  and our business could be harmed 
a number of data center providers have recently encountered financial difficulties  and the industry has experienced consolidation 
in the event that we cannot obtain adequate data center space from third parties  we could be required to build our own data center facilities  which would require significant capital expenditures  could delay the expansion of our operations and could change the nature of our business model 
in addition  some data center providers require us to enter into contracts for data center space in advance of customer commitments  and to the extent that we are unable to grow our customer base at the rate that we anticipate in the geographic areas in which we have contracted for space  our operating results will suffer 
some of our existing data center providers offer services beyond their core co location or web site hosting offerings 
to the extent that these providers expand the scope of these services to address some of the functionality we currently provide  this may limit our ability to renew existing agreements and enter into new agreements for data center space with existing or new data center providers 
we operate in a new  highly competitive market  and our inability to compete successfully against new entrants and established companies would limit our ability to increase our market share and would harm our financial results 
our market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
our primary current and prospective competitors include providers of systems integration or professional services  and providers of co location or web site hosting and related services 
in addition to existing competitors  we may also face competition from new market entrants in the future due to limited barriers to entry and industry consolidation 
because we offer businesses the ability to outsource their operations  we also compete against a company s internal operations department  which may prefer to manage their own operations 
this may be particularly the case with larger enterprises  which represent our key target market 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources  larger customer bases  longer operating histories  more developed infrastructures  greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we have 
as a result  many of our competitors may be able to develop and expand their service offerings more rapidly  adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more quickly  take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities more readily  achieve greater economies of scale  devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their services and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can 
because of these competitive factors and due to our comparatively small size and limited financial resources  we may be unable to compete successfully 
our competitors and other companies may form strategic relationships with each other to compete with us 
these relationships may take the form of strategic investments  joint marketing agreements  licenses or other contractual arrangements  any of which may increase our competitors ability to address customer needs with their product and service offerings 
in addition  we believe that there will be continued consolidation within the markets in which we compete 
our competitors may consolidate with one another  or acquire other technology providers  enabling them to more effectively compete with us 
this consolidation could affect prices and other competitive factors in ways that would impede our ability to compete successfully and harm our business 
some of the data centers providers with whom we have relationships offer services beyond their core co location or web site hosting offerings 
to the extent that these providers expand the scope of these new services to address some of the functionality we currently provide  some of these companies may be unwilling to provide services to us or to enter into relationships with us 
poor performance in or disruptions of the services we deliver to our customers could harm our reputation  delay market acceptance of our services and subject us to liabilities 
we provide our customers service level agreements slas for specified managed services provided by us 
the slas specify the events constituting down time for each of the major customer site components  and the actions that we will take to repair or respond to such down time 
the slas also provide a guaranteed time within which we will undertake the required repair or response 
if we fail to meet these slas  we may be required to credit a percentage of the fees a customer has paid for our services  generally up to a maximum of of all service fees accrued in the month of the outage 
in addition  from time to time we issue discretionary credits to address service and performance issues  even though we have no contractual obligation to do so 
these discretionary credits are issued prior to recognizing revenue for the related services 
our operations depend upon our ability and the ability of our third party data center and network services providers to maintain and protect the computer systems on which we provide our services 
although our data center and network providers maintain back up systems  a natural disaster  human error  physical or electronic security breaches  power loss  terrorist attacks  sabotage or similar disruption at any of their sites could impair our ability to provide our services to our customers until the site is repaired or back up systems become operable 
some of our data center providers  as well as our corporate headquarters  are located in northern california near known earthquake fault zones 
our systems and the data centers we use are also vulnerable to damage from fire  flood  telecommunications failures  power outages and similar events 
in addition  because many of our customers depend upon their internet operations to help run their businesses  they could be seriously harmed if the services we provide to them work improperly or fail  even if only temporarily 
our inability to maintain the quality of our services at acceptable levels could cause our reputation to suffer  hinder our ability to obtain and retain new customers  force us to divert research and development and management resources  cause a loss of revenue or subject us to liabilities  any one of which could adversely affect our results and harm our business 
our business will suffer if we do not enhance or introduce new services and upgrades to meet changing customer requirements 
the market for managed internet services is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new hardware  software and networking product introductions and internet related technology enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
any delays in responding to these changes and developing and releasing enhanced or new services could hinder our ability to retain existing and obtain new customers 
in particular  our technology is designed to support a variety of hardware  software and networking products that we believe to be proven and among the most widely used 
we cannot be certain  however  that present and future customers will continue to use these products 
even if they do  new versions of these products are likely to be released and we will need to adapt our technology to these new versions 
we must  therefore  constantly modify and enhance our technology to keep pace with changes made to our customers hardware and software configurations and network infrastructures 
if we fail to promptly modify or enhance our technology in response to evolving customer needs and demands  fail to introduce new products or fail to fully develop our new product offerings  our technology may not achieve widespread acceptance and could become obsolete  which would significantly harm our business 
in addition  frequent changes in the hardware  software and networking components of the systems and services we provide could adversely affect our ability to automate the deployment process  a key element of our business strategy 
if we do not develop  license or acquire new products and services  or deliver enhancements to existing products and services on a timely and cost effective basis  we may be unable to meet the growing demands of our existing and potential customers 
in addition  as we introduce new services or technologies into existing customer architectures  we may experience performance problems associated with incompatibility among different versions of hardware  software and networking products 
to the extent that such problems occur  we may face adverse publicity  loss of sales  delay in market acceptance of our services or customer claims against us  any of which could harm our business 
we rely on third party hardware  software and networking products to deliver our services to our customers  and the loss of access to these products could harm our business 
as part of our normal operations  we purchase  license or lease software  hardware and networking products from third party commercial vendors 
we obtain most of our components from third parties on a purchase order basis 
these products may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the loss of these products or our third party lease finance arrangements could result in delays in the sale of our services until equivalent technology  if available  is identified  procured and integrated  and these delays could result in lost revenues 
some of the key components of our services are available only from sole or limited sources 
for example  only hardware manufactured by sun microsystems is compatible with the solaris operating system  which is a key component used by many of our customers 
further  to the extent that the vendors from whom we purchase these products increase their prices  our gross margins could be negatively impacted 
security risks and concerns may decrease the demand for our services  and security breaches may disrupt our services or make them inaccessible to our customers 
our services involve the storage and transmission of business critical  proprietary information 
if the security measures we or our third party data centers have implemented are breached  our customers could lose this information  and we could be exposed to litigation and possible liability 
anyone who circumvents these security measures could misappropriate business critical proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services or operations 
in addition  computer hackers could introduce computer viruses into our systems or those of our customers  which could disrupt our services or make them inaccessible to customers 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
our security measures and those that our third party data centers provide may be inadequate to prevent security breaches  and our business and reputation will suffer if these breaches occur 
if we are unable to retain our executive officers and key personnel  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 
our business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of our key employees  all of whom are employed on an at will basis 
if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees  in particular  marc andreessen  our chairman  benjamin horowitz  our president and chief executive officer or timothy howes  our chief technical officer and executive vice president of development  or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives 
our business will suffer if we are unable to retain our highly qualified employees 
our future success depends on our ability to retain our highly qualified technical  sales and marketing  managerial and administrative personnel 
in may and september  we instituted a number of cost reducing and organizational realignment measures  including reductions in headcount 
as a result  employee morale may have suffered  and it may be more difficult to retain our highly qualified employees or recruit new employees 
our failure to retain our qualified personnel could seriously disrupt our operations and increase our costs by forcing us to use more expensive outside consultants and reduce the rate at which we can increase revenue 
if our customer base and revenue continue to grow  we may need to hire additional qualified personnel 
competition for qualified personnel can be intense  and we may not be able to attract  train  integrate or retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel if we need to do so in the future 
important components of the compensation of our personnel are stock options and restricted stock  which typically vest over a four year period 
we face a significant challenge in retaining our employees if the value of these stock options and restricted stock is either not substantial enough or so substantial that the employees leave after their stock options or restricted stock have vested 
to retain our employees  we expect to continue to grant new options subject to vesting schedules  which will be dilutive to our stockholders 
a large number of our employees hold options at higher exercise prices than the price at which our common stock is currently trading 
if our stock price does not increase in the future  we may need to exchange options for new options  issue new options or grant additional shares of stock in the future to motivate and retain our employees 
if we do not continue to expand our direct and indirect sales organizations  we will have difficulty acquiring and retaining customers 
our services require a sophisticated sales effort targeted at a limited number of key people within our prospective customers organizations 
because the market for our services is new  many prospective customers are unfamiliar with the services we offer 
as a result  our sales effort requires highly trained sales personnel 
we need to continue to expand our sales organization in order to increase market awareness of our services to a greater number of organizations and  in turn  to generate increased revenue 
we are in the process of developing our direct sales force  and we require additional qualified sales personnel 
competition for these individuals is intense  and we may not be able to hire the type and number of sales personnel we need 
moreover  even after we hire these individuals  they require extensive training in our services 
in addition  we must continue to develop our indirect sales and marketing channels 
if we are unable to continue to expand our direct and indirect sales operations and train new sales personnel as rapidly as necessary  we may not be able to increase market awareness and sales of our services  which may prevent us from growing our revenue and achieving and maintaining profitability 
due to our limited operating history  we have limited ability to forecast future demands for our services 
we provide our services through customer service agreements with our customers 
due to our limited operating history  only a relatively small number of our customer service agreements have expired 
therefore  we have limited historical information with which to forecast future demand for our services from our existing customer base after existing contracts expire 
whether or not customers renew our services will depend  in large part  on their level of customer satisfaction 
accordingly  we must invest sufficient resources in our customer satisfaction programs and instill a high level of customer service in all of our employees 
if our customers elect not to renew our services or to renew our services at a reduced level  our business and financial results may suffer 
because our success depends on our proprietary technology  if third parties infringe our intellectual property  we may be forced to expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury 
our success depends in large part on our intellectual property  including our proprietary technology 
we currently rely on a combination of copyright  trademark  trade secret and other laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
these legal protections afford only limited protection  and our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
our intellectual property may be subject to even greater risk in foreign jurisdictions  as the laws of many countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
if we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property  our competitive position may suffer 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to detect infringement and may lose our competitive position in the market before we are able to ascertain any such infringement 
in addition  competitors may design around our proprietary technology or develop competing technologies 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement 
any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources  including the attention of senior management 
other companies  including our competitors  may obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use or sell our services 
as a result  we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others 
defending against intellectual property infringement and other claims could be time consuming and expensive and  if we are not successful  could subject us to significant damages and disrupt our business 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the disputed technology  our business and operating results would be significantly harmed 
intellectual property litigation has become prevalent in the internet and software fields 
any litigation or claims  whether or not valid  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following pay costly damages  stop selling services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right  which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  and redesign our services or our network  if feasible 
if we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions  our business may be seriously harmed 
in addition  any of these could have the effect of increasing our costs and reducing our revenue 
our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
we may engage in future acquisitions or investments  which may harm our operating results 
from time to time we may make acquisitions of or investments in other companines in an effort to increase our customer base  broaden our offerings and expand our technology platform 
for instance  in february  we entered into an agreement to acquire frontera corporation  a privately held managed services provider located in southern california  for consideration consisting solely of our common stock 
the closing of the acquisition  expected to occur in the second quarter of  is subject to customary closing conditions  including frontera stockholder approval and regulatory approvals 
our ability to successfully complete acquisitions and investments is unproven 
if we fail to evaluate and to execute acquisitions or investments successfully  they may seriously harm our business 
to complete the acquisition of frontera corporation and other acquisitions successfully  we must effectively provide services to any newly acquired customers  properly evaluate the technology acquired  accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction  including accounting charges and transaction expenses  integrate and retain personnel  combine potentially different corporate cultures  and effectively integrate services and products as well as technology  sales  marketing and support operations 
if we fail to do any of these  we may suffer losses  or our management may be distracted from our day to day operations 
in addition  if we conduct acquisitions using convertible debt or equity securities  existing stockholders will be diluted 
we face risks associated with international operations that could harm our business 
we have committed  and will likely continue to commit  significant resources to our international operations and sales and marketing activities 
for example  we maintain offices in the united kingdom and germany 
we have limited experience conducting business outside of the united states  and we may not be aware of all the factors that may affect our business in foreign jurisdictions 
we will be subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs  lengthen our sales cycles and require significant management attention 
these risks include increased costs and expenses related to the leasing of foreign  third party data center space  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  the added complexity and expense of adapting our opsware technology to systems and equipment designed to operate outside the united states  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competition  general economic and political conditions in international markets  potentially adverse tax consequences  including complications and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  currency exchange rate fluctuations  and unusual or burdensome regulatory requirements or unexpected changes to those requirements 
if one or more of these risks were to materialize  our financial results could suffer 
our success depends on the continued growth in the usage of the internet 
rapid growth in the use of and interest in the internet has occurred only recently 
acceptance and use may not continue to develop at historical rates and a sufficiently broad base of consumers and businesses may not adopt or continue to use the internet and other online services as a medium of commerce 
factors that may affect internet usage include actual or perceived lack of security of information  congestion of internet traffic or other usage delays  and reluctance to adopt new business methods 
if internet usage does not continue to increase  demand for our services may be limited  and our business and results of operations could be harmed 
governmental regulation and the application of existing laws to the internet may slow the internet s growth  increase our costs of doing business and create potential liability for the dissemination of information over the internet 
laws and regulations governing internet services  related communications services and information technologies and electronic commerce are beginning to emerge but remain largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws  such as those governing intellectual property  privacy  libel  telecommunications and taxation  apply to the internet and to related services such as ours 
uncertainty and new laws and regulations  as well as the application of existing laws to the internet  affecting our markets could limit our ability to operate in these markets  expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and time consuming litigation 
the international nature of the internet and the possibility that we may be subject to conflicting laws of  or the exercise of jurisdiction by  different countries may make it difficult or impossible to comply with all the laws that may govern our activities 
furthermore  the laws and regulations relating to the liability of online service providers for information carried on or disseminated through their networks is currently unsettled 
underdeveloped telecommunications and internet infrastructure may limit the growth of the internet overseas and the growth of our business 
access to the internet requires advanced telecommunications infrastructure 
the telecommunications infrastructure in many parts of europe and the asia pacific region is not as well developed as in the united states and is partly owned and operated by current or former national monopoly telecommunications carriers or may be subject to a restrictive regulatory environment 
the quality and continued development of telecommunications infrastructure in europe and the asia pacific region will have a significant impact on our ability to deliver our services in these regions and on the market use and acceptance of the internet in general 
in addition  the recent growth in the use of the internet has caused frequent periods of performance degradation  requiring the upgrade of routers and switches  telecommunications links and other components forming the infrastructure of the internet by internet service providers and other organizations with links to the internet 
any perceived degradation in the performance of the internet as a whole could undermine the benefits of our services 
the quality of our services is ultimately limited by and reliant upon the speed and reliability of internet related networks operated by third parties 
consequently  the emergence and growth of the market for our services is dependent on improvements being made to the entire internet infrastructure in europe  the asia pacific region and latin america 
our stock price has been volatile and could decline substantially 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past  will likely continue to fluctuate in the future and may decline 
the market for technology stocks has been extremely volatile and frequently reaches levels that bear no relationship to the past or present operating performance of those companies 
in addition  as an early stage company  small delays in customer bookings  installations or revenue could result in material variations in our quarterly results and quarter to quarter growth in the foreseeable future 
this could result in greater volatility in our stock price 
among the factors that could affect our stock price are variations in our quarter to quarter operating results  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  new or enhanced products or services  acquisitions  distribution partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  changes in financial estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business  our sale of common stock or other securities in the future  changes in economic and capital market conditions for companies in our sector  changes in market valuations or earnings of our competitors  changes in business or regulatory conditions  and the trading volume of our common stock 
we are a defendant in class action lawsuits in which the plaintiffs claim that we and certain of our officers  directors and underwriters of our initial public offering violated federal securities laws 
we are currently a defendant in multiple lawsuits filed beginning in august claiming that we  certain of our officers  directors and the underwriters of our initial public offering violated federal securities laws by providing materially false and misleading information in our prospectus 
these lawsuits  which are pending in the us district courts for the southern district of new york and the northern district of california  are being brought as a class action on behalf of all purchasers of our common stock from march  to may   and seek damages in unspecified amounts 
we strongly deny these allegations and will defend ourselves vigorously  however  litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that we will not be materially affected 
in addition  we anticipate that we will incur associated litigation expenses in connection with these lawsuits 
insiders have substantial control over us and this could delay or prevent a change in control and may negatively affect your investment 
as of april   our executive officers  directors and their affiliates beneficially own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions  which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us and could affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the interests of those holding this concentrated ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders  and  accordingly  they could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that we would not otherwise consider 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions that could make it more difficult to acquire us 
our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for example  our board of directors might reject a takeover bid otherwise favored by a majority of our stockholders 
these provisions include classifying our board of directors into three groups so that the directors in each group will serve staggered three year terms  which would make it difficult for a potential acquirer to gain control of our board of directors  authorizing the issuance of shares of undesignated preferred stock without a vote of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  and limitations on stockholders ability to call special stockholder meetings 
substantial sales of our common stock could depress our stock price 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  the market price of our common stock could fall 
as of april   we have  shares of common stock outstanding 
if we consummate the acquisition of frontera corporation  we will be obligated to issue shares of common stock equal to the final purchase price  which is currently expected to be approximately  shares 
in connection with the acquisition  the stockholders of frontera corporation and certain of our executive officers have entered into agreements that restrict their ability to dispose of their stock for a period of days following the closing of the acquisition 
in addition  the stockholders of frontera corporation will be prohibited  during either of the two day periods following the initial day restricted period  from disposing of shares which in the aggregate exceed of the prior quarter s trading volume of our common stock as reported by nasdaq and as adjusted for nasdaq s double counting of sales and purchases 
accordingly  a substantial number of shares of our common stock could be sold into the market and could depress our stock price after the above restrictions elapse 
approximately million of our outstanding shares continue to be held by venture capital firms that have not yet distributed their shares to their limited partners 
if these venture capital firms were to distribute their shares to their limited partners  the subsequent sale of shares by those limited partners could depress our stock price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have limited exposure to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would not significantly increase or decrease interest expense on our debt obligations due to the fixed nature of our debt obligations 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in less than million decrease less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities 
as we expand into foreign markets  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets we plan to target 
the majority of our sales are currently made in us dollars and a strengthening of the dollar could make our services less competitive in the foreign markets we may target in the future
