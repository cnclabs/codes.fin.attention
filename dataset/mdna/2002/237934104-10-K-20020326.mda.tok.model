item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item the following information includes forward looking statements  the realization of which may be affected by certain important factors discussed under risk factors 
overview we are an independent architect of enterprise class information storage infrastructures 
we derive our revenues principally from designing and installing data storage systems 
our solutions can include hardware products  such as disk arrays  tape systems  interconnection components  and storage management software products 
prior to january   we recognized revenues for hardware and software product sales when we shipped the products and software to our customers or after they accepted products under evaluation 
however  in december  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  which clarified the sec staff s view regarding the recognition and reporting of revenues in particular transactions 
in light of sab no 
 we modified our revenue recognition policy related to hardware and software products when we provide any installation or configuration services in connection with the sale 
we now recognize revenue from hardware and software product sales when we complete our installation and configuration services 
this change was effective as of january  under the sab no 
transition provisions  we accounted for this change in accounting policy prospectively 
as of january   we recorded a charge to earnings of  representing the cumulative effect  net of income taxes  of this change in our accounting policy 
as indicated above  our customers frequently engage us for assistance in the installation of our solutions 
occasionally  they also engage us for consulting services 
we recognize revenues for this work as we render these services 
we sell support service contracts to most of our customers 
when customers purchase support services through us  customers receive the benefit of integrated support 
we have a qualified  independent support desk to provide routine customer support services covering minor problems 
we fulfill on site assistance by purchasing support service agreements for our customers from our hardware and software vendors or their designated third party service providers and by arranging on site support assistance with the appropriate vendor if necessary 
we defer revenues and direct costs resulting from these contracts  and amortize these revenues and expenses into operations  over the term of the contracts  which are generally twelve months 
in the past  we have experienced fluctuations in the timing of orders from our customers  and we expect to continue to experience these fluctuations in the future 
these fluctuations have resulted from  among other things  the time required to design  test and evaluate our data storage solutions before customers deploy them  the size of customer orders  the complexity of our customers network environments  necessary system configuration to deploy our solutions and new product introductions by suppliers 
completion of our installation and configuration services may also delay recognition of revenues 
current economic conditions and competition also affect our customers decisions to place orders with us 
as a result  our net sales may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
prior to our initial public offering in august  we were an s corporation 
the only income tax expense we reported prior to august resulted from the c corporation taxable income of direct connect systems  inc  or dcsi  allocated to us between july  when we acquired dcsi  and january  when we merged dcsi into us 
upon our august initial public offering  we became a c corporation and began reporting income tax expense 
this change in tax status complicates comparison of our historical operating results 
in november  we acquired certain assets of the data storage and services business of opensystems 
com  inc  a walpole  massachusetts based firm engaged in the resale and installation of data storage solutions 
results of operations the following table shows  for the periods indicated  certain selected financial data expressed as a percentage of net sales 
years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative engineering amortization of goodwill and other intangibles offering costs total operating expenses operating income comparison of years ended december    and net sales 
our product sales decreased in from to million  but increased in over to million 
our product sales were million in our service sales  which include customer support and installation services  increased in over to million and increased in over to million 
our service sales in were million 
our lower product sales in reflect a decline in overall capital spending by our customers 
we experienced a very difficult and competitive operating environment during most of this uncertainty was further complicated by the world events such as the terrorist attacks on the united states in september 
the high level of economic uncertainty has led to an overall reduction in capital spending by united states businesses  including spending for technology 
the growth in our service revenues between and reflects an increase in new maintenance contract sales and contract renewals by existing customers 
we derived approximately  and of our sales from one customer during  and  respectively 
we cannot assure you that this customer will account for a substantial portion of our future sales 
gross profit 
our total gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in and in our gross profit improved over these years generally due to our increased sales of large  complex storage systems solutions and lower costs for obsolete inventory 
similarly  product gross profit as a percentage of product sales increased to in as compared to in and in service gross profit as a percentage of service sales increased to in from in and in the increase in gross profit rates for services reflects our ability to obtain higher margins on our integrated support services 
charges for excess and obsolete inventory in  and of  million and  respectively  adversely affected our gross profit 
in particular  during  we disposed of excess  old generation inventories at liquidation values significantly below our acquisition cost 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include wages and commissions paid to sales and marketing personnel  travel costs  advertising  promotion and hiring expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in compared to million in and million in as a percentage of net sales  our sales and marketing expenses were in  in and in the increase in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of our net sales and in absolute dollars from to resulted primarily from the hiring of additional field account executives as we continued to open new sales offices and expand our business and the increase in commissions commensurate with the increase in sales 
new field account executives are usually less productive during their first two years than more seasoned sales personnel 
the increase in sales expense as a percentage of sales and in absolute dollars from to resulted primarily from our new regional structure 
under our new structure  we added regional sales directors and additional field account executives to provide for the future growth and expansion of our business 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include wages for administrative personnel  professional fees  depreciation  communication expenses and rent and related facility expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in and million in as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses were in  in and in the increase in general and administrative expenses in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales reflects the expanded costs of managing our business as well as sales office expansion during and these increases include higher rents  communication expense and related facility charges for our regional offices and new headquarters 
in  depreciation expense increased as we added new facilities and information systems 
engineering 
engineering expenses include employee wages and travel  hiring and training expenses for our professional engineers and technicians 
we allocate engineering costs associated with installation services to our cost of service sales 
engineering expenses increased to million in compared to million in and million in engineering expenses as a percentage of net sales were in  in and in the increase in engineering expenses in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to our investment in a new regional structure  including the hiring of regional engineering directors and additional field engineers 
we also attribute the increase to competitive salary increases for our existing engineers  travel expenses related to the geographic expansion of our business and costs for engineering laboratory equipment to support the testing and training needs of our engineering staff 
goodwill and other intangible amortization 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets increased to million in compared to million in and  in these increases relate to our acquisition of the data storage and services business of opensystems 
com  inc in november in  we expect our amortization expense to decrease by million from due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and intangible assets 
this statement requires that we no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  but instead test for impairment annually or whenever impairment is indicated 
for more information  see note of the notes to our financial statements 
offering costs 
during the second quarter of  we expensed approximately  of costs for a proposed second public offering of our common stock  which was withdrawn due to market conditions 
we incurred expenses of approximately  in the first quarter of in conjunction with our initial public offering 
this offering was twice delayed by market conditions 
as required  we expensed these previously deferred costs each time we determined that the offerings would be delayed more than days 
operating loss income 
we incurred an operating loss of  in compared to operating income of million in operating income decreased in from million in the decrease in operating income was principally attributable to our sales decline under difficult economic conditions combined with an increase in our operating expenses in the anticipation of revenue growth and market share gains 
income taxes 
until august  when we became a public company  we were an s corporation and were not taxed on our income 
we provided for income taxes of  in  million in  and  in our income tax expense resulted from the taxable income we generated after our august initial public offering and the tax effect of the merger of dcsi into datalink 
for more information  see note of the notes to our financial statements 
even though we generated an operating loss in  we still incurred income tax expense which reflects permanent differences  such as non deductible goodwill amortization  between our reported and taxable income as well as state taxes 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
as described in the overview above  in the first quarter of  we incurred a one time  non cash charge of  representing the cumulative effect  net of income taxes  of the accounting changes we made effective as of january   to our revenue recognition policies to comply with the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
see note of the notes to our financial statements 
quarterly results and seasonality the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly financial data for each quarter of and in our opinion  this unaudited information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited information and includes all adjustments including all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the information set forth below 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

in thousands net sales gross profit operating income loss net income loss we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  quarterly variations in our net sales as a result of a number of factors  including the length of the sales cycle with customers for large storage system evaluations and purchases  delays in storage system installations or configurations  new product introductions by suppliers and their market acceptance  delays in product shipments or other quality control difficulties  our ability to integrate any acquired businesses  trends in the enterprise class information storage industry in general  the geographic and industry specific market in which we are currently active  or may be in the future  and the opening of new field offices 
in addition  current economic conditions and competition also affect our customers decisions to place orders with us 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our operations and capital requirements through cash flows generated from operations  supplemental bank borrowings and the proceeds from our initial public offering 
our working capital was million at december  as compared to million at december  our current ratio was at december  as compared to at december  at december   our cash and cash equivalents balance was million 
cash provided by operating activities for was million as compared to million in and million in the cash provided in resulted primarily from a reduction in inventories of million and a reduction in shipped but not installed inventories of million  offset by a decrease in payables of million 
the reduction in inventories for resulted from our increased efforts to optimize our inventory levels and to complete the installation of products for customers at year end 
the cash provided by operating activities in resulted primarily from our net income and a reduction in accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable  partially offset by an increase in inventories 
cash provided by operations in reflected our increasing sales and net income  partially offset by increased accounts receivable and inventories due to the increase in net revenues 
cash used in investing activities during was million as compared to million in and million in in  we purchased furniture and fixtures for our new corporate headquarters in chanhassen  minnesota and invested in our new information and phone systems and engineering laboratory equipment 
our uses reflected expenditures for engineering and lab equipment  the purchase of land adjacent to our new corporate headquarters facility and a  deposit on the new corporate headquarters that we began leasing in june the uses also included million to acquire the data storage and services business of opensystems 
com  inc uses of cash were related to the purchases of computer equipment and upgrades  leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures 
cash used in financing activities during was  as compared to million in in  we made a scheduled payment of  on a note due to a former s corporation stockholder  which was partially offset by  of proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan and stock option exercises 
in  we used  to make a final dividend distribution to the ten pre initial public offering stockholders related to their tax liabilities 
we also made a scheduled payment of  on the former s corporation shareholder s note 
these uses were partially offset by  of proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
cash provided by financing activities was million in in  net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock related to our public offering were offset  in part  by net repayments of borrowings of million and million of dividend distributions paid to our ten pre initial public offering stockholders  million of which enabled stockholders to pay their income tax liabilities resulting from our s corporation taxable income 
the remaining million dividend distribution to these stockholders represented all previously taxed  but undistributed  s corporation earnings 
in february  we amended our credit agreement with a commercial bank that provides for a million revolving line of credit for financing potential business acquisitions and a million revolving line of credit for financing our working capital needs 
the term of the agreement ends june  borrowings under the lines of credit are secured by our accounts receivable and inventory and are subject to certain financial and operating covenants  including covenants that require us to maintain a minimum current ratio  debt net worth ratio  tangible net worth and level of profitability 
we had no outstanding borrowings as of december  for more information  see note of the notes to our financial statements 
in  we signed an year non cancelable lease for our new corporate headquarters in chanhassen  minnesota 
the lease requires base rental payments of approximately million in the first year and million for each subsequent year 
for more information  see note of the notes to our financial statements 
in february  we redeemed  shares of common stock held by one of our former stockholders and issued him a million note payable in four installments through february we made principal payments of   and  on this note in august  february and february  respectively 
we made our final payment on this note in february  leaving datalink with no outstanding funded debt 
in november  we purchased the data storage and service business of opensystems 
com  inc for million cash and  shares of our common stock 
we agreed to pay an additional million in cash if particular revenue targets for the acquired business had been met 
the revenue targets were not met in  therefore no amounts are due 
we believe that funds generated from operations  together with the available credit under our revolving credit agreement  will be sufficient to finance our current operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we are planning for to million of capital expenditures through primarily related to the implementation of our customer relationship management information system 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition as discussed in note of the notes to our financial statements  we recognize revenues from hardware and software product sales only after substantially all installation services have been completed and the product is functioning properly rather than upon shipment 
we believe this policy minimizes management s judgments over the timing and extent of revenue recognition 
although the policy that we adopted on january  contains very specific guidelines for measuring revenue  certain judgments do affect the application of our revenue policy  such as evaluating multiple element arrangements 
inventory we periodically review  estimate and adjust our reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the inventory cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
recent accounting pronouncements amortization of goodwill 
in june  fasb approved for issuance statement of financial accounting standards sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and intangible assets 
for all business combinations initiated after june   these statements require the use of the purchase  rather than the pooling  method of accounting 
intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded separately from goodwill if they arise from contractual or other legal rights or are separable from the acquired entity and can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged  either individually or as part of a related contract  asset or liability 
the statements also provide that effective january   goodwill is no longer amortized 
instead  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are generally tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator 
all acquired goodwill is assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing 
we do not expect to incur any transitional goodwill impairment losses on our unamortized goodwill balances upon adoption of these statements  which totaled million at december  effective january   we ceased amortization of our goodwill 
amortization of goodwill was million in however  we will perform impairment analyses of our goodwill whenever we believe it is impaired 
if the undiscounted cash flows  without interest or tax charges  are less than the carrying value of the assets under impairment review  we will write the assets down to fair market value 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is further impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we will continue to amortize other identified intangibles with determinable lives  which totaled million at december  long lived assets 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the provisions of this statement provide a single accounting model for impairment of long lived assets 
the adoption of sfas no 
on january  did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  we will perform impairment analyses of our long lived assets whenever we believe they are impaired 
if the undiscounted cash flows  without interest or tax charges  are less than the carrying value of the assets under impairment review  we will write the assets down to fair market value 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that long lived assets are further impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
use of derivatives and hedging activities 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in other contract  and for hedging activities 
sfas as amended by sfas no 
became effective for us in the first quarter of the adoption of sfas did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations in recent years 
we cannot assure you that inflation will not adversely affect our business in the future 
risk factors current economic conditions adversely impact our revenues and profits 
during and continuing to the present  we have experienced a very difficult and competitive operating environment 
this uncertainty was further complicated by the world events such as the terrorist attacks on the united states in september the high level of economic uncertainty has led to an overall reduction in capital spending  including spending for technology 
some of our customers have canceled or delayed planned purchases 
others have replaced large storage solution installation projects with smaller  piecemeal projects that carry lower profit margins for us 
competition for available business has also affected our margins 
we cannot predict the continuing effect of current economic conditions on our business 
if our revenues and cash flows continue to be adversely affected  we may need to reduce our expenses or personnel 
this could adversely affect our ability to capitalize on future technology spending by our customers at such time as economic conditions improve 
competition could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues or profitability 
the enterprise class information storage market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
as technologies change rapidly  we expect that competition will increase in the future 
we compete with independent storage system suppliers to the high end market and numerous resellers  distributors and consultants 
we also compete in the storage systems market with general purpose computer suppliers 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  purchasing and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of products and deliver competitive products at lower end user prices 
some of our current and potential competitors include our suppliers 
we are not the exclusive supplier of any data storage product we offer 
instead  our suppliers market their products through other independent data storage solution providers  original equipment manufacturers and  often  through their own internal sales forces 
we believe direct competition from our suppliers is likely to increase if  as expected  the data storage industry continues to consolidate 
this consolidation would probably result in fewer suppliers with greater resources to devote to internal sales and marketing efforts 
in addition  our suppliers have established and will probably continue to establish cooperative relationships with other suppliers and other data storage solution providers 
these cooperative relationships are often intended to enable our suppliers to offer comprehensive storage solutions  which compete with those we offer 
if our relationships with our suppliers become adversarial  it will be more difficult for us to stay ahead of industry developments and provide our customers with the type of service they expect from us 
in addition  most of our customers already employ in house technical staffs 
to the extent a customer s in house technical staff develops sophisticated storage systems expertise  the customer may be less likely to seek our services 
further  we compete with storage service providers who manage  store and backup their customers data at off site  networked data storage locations 
our growth plans depend in part on our ability to successfully complete acquisitions 
as part of our growth plan  we intend to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions of businesses that give us access to additional qualified technical personnel and either expand or complement our business 
to date we have completed two such acquisitions 
however  our last acquisition was in november and we cannot assure any further acquisitions 
if we do not make more suitable acquisitions  we will find it more difficult to realize our growth objectives 
if we do make acquisitions  we will face a number of other risks and challenges  including the difficulty of integrating dissimilar operations or assets  assimilation of new employees who may not initially contribute at the levels we expect from our other employees  diversion of management time and resources  increases in administrative costs  including amortization of purchased intangible assets  potential loss of key employees of an acquired company  and additional costs associated with obtaining any necessary financing 
these factors and our limited experience in negotiating  consummating and integrating acquisitions could hamper our ability to realize our growth objectives  and could adversely affect our business  earnings  financial condition and  ultimately  our stock price 
acquisitions that use stock as payment  also could result in dilution of our per share earnings  and of your voting rights 
our business depends on our ability to hire and retain scarce technical personnel 
our future operating results depend upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified engineers with enterprise class information storage solutions experience 
if we fail to recruit and retain additional engineering personnel  we will experience greater difficulty realizing our growth strategy  which could negatively affect our business  financial condition and stock price 
we derive a large percentage of our revenues from a small number of customers 
in  we derived of our revenues from one customer  and our top five customers collectively accounted for of our revenues 
because we intend to continue to seek out large projects  we expect that a significant percentage of our revenues will continue to come from a small number of customers  although the composition of our key customers is likely to change from year to year 
if we fail to obtain a growing number of large projects each year  our revenues and profitability will likely be adversely affected 
in addition  our reliance on large projects makes it more likely that our revenues and profits will fluctuate unpredictably from year to year 
unpredictable revenue and profit fluctuations may make our stock price more volatile and lead to a decline in our stock price 
our revenue recognition policies unpredictably defer reporting of our revenues 
we increasingly sell complex enterprise class information storage solutions 
we do not recognize revenues from our sale of hardware and software products to our customers until we complete our required installation or configuration of these products 
installation and configuration of these solutions requires significant coordination with our customers and vendors 
therefore  even if we have shipped all products to our customers  we may be unable to control the timing of product installation and configuration 
these delays prevent us from recognizing revenue on products we ship and may adversely affect our quarterly reported revenues 
as a result  our stock price may decline 
future goodwill impairment may unpredictably affect our financial results 
under new sec accounting rules  we no longer amortize goodwill 
instead  we perform impairment analyses of our goodwill whenever we believe it is impaired 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is further impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on only a few key suppliers and would suffer materially if we could not obtain their products 
we rely on our close relationships with our suppliers to provide access to products and new technology necessary to design and implement leading edge enterprise class information storage solutions for our customers 
we do not have long term supply contracts with any of our suppliers 
in many instances  we rely upon only one or two suppliers for each of our key products 
our reliance on these suppliers leaves us vulnerable to an inadequate supply of required products  price increases  late deliveries and poor product quality 
disruption or termination of the supply of products from our suppliers for any reason would likely prevent or delay our shipments to our customers 
our customers expect reliable and prompt service from us 
if we cannot obtain necessary components  or the components we obtain are unreliable or unexpectedly expensive  we will not meet our customers expectations 
if we cannot meet our customers expectations  our business will suffer considerably 
we generally do not have employment agreements with our key employees 
our future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our executive officers  managers  salespeople  engineers and other technical personnel  many who have substantial experience in our industry and would be difficult to replace 
in general  we do not have employment  non competition or nondisclosure agreements with our officers or employees 
accordingly  our employees may voluntarily leave us at any time and work for our competitors 
our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to retain our current employees and hire new employees 
any failure to retain our key employees will make it much more difficult for us to maintain our operations and attain our growth objectives and could therefore be expected to adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and stock price 
we do not have employment  non competition or non disclosure agreements with any of our executive officers or employees  other than non competition agreements entered into in connection with the acquisition of direct connect systems  inc and non competition agreements assigned to us in connection with the acquisition of certain assets of opensystems 
com  inc if we cannot effectively manage our future growth  our business may suffer 
our planned growth and expansion  if realized in light of current economic conditions  would place a significant strain on our administrative  operational and financial resources 
this growth may also increase demands on our professional and technical services  sales  marketing and customer service and support functions 
our planned geographic expansion may exacerbate these challenges and require us to hire  train  motivate and manage new management  technical  sales and administrative employees 
if we manage this planned growth poorly  we may be unable to continue to provide our customers with the high level of technical service and expertise they expect from us 
this failure would harm our reputation  hamper our ability to grow and adversely affect our financial condition and stock price 
in addition  our planned geographic expansion  if realized in light of current economic conditions  will increase our costs and make it more difficult to manage our operations 
as a result  we may not achieve commercial success or maintain client service and support at historic levels 
if we fail to manage our growth and generate sufficient revenues to offset the additional costs of geographical expansion  our profitability  financial condition and stock price will likely suffer 
if the data storage industry fails to develop compelling new storage technologies  our business may suffer 
rapid and complex technological change  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards increase demand for our services 
because of this  our future success depends in part on the data storage industry s ability to continue to develop leading edge storage technology solutions 
our customers utilize our services in part because they know that newer technologies offer them significant benefits over the older technologies they are using 
if the data storage industry ceases to develop compelling new storage solutions  or if a single data storage standard becomes widely accepted and implemented  it will be more difficult to sell new data storage systems to our customers 
our long sales cycle may cause fluctuating operating results  which may adversely affect our stock price 
our sales cycle is typically long and unpredictable  making it difficult to plan our business 
current economic conditions have increased this uncertainty 
our long sales cycle requires us to invest resources in potential projects that may not occur 
in addition  our long and unpredictable sales cycle may cause us to experience significant fluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results 
it can also result in delayed revenues  difficulty in matching revenues with expenses and increased expenditures 
our business  operating results or financial condition and stock price may suffer as a result of any of these factors 
control by our existing stockholders could discourage the potential acquisition of our business 
currently  our executive officers  directors and or greater stockholders and their affiliates beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
acting together  these insiders could elect our entire board of directors and control the outcome of all other matters requiring stockholder approval 
this voting concentration may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our management or control or otherwise discourage potential acquirers from attempting to gain control of us 
if potential acquirers are deterred  you may lose an opportunity to profit from a possible acquisition premium in our stock price 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our initial public offering  and may continue to be volatile 
we cannot assure you that our stock price will increase  or even that it will not decline significantly from the price you pay 
our stock price may be adversely affected by many factors  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technical innovations  new products or services offered by us  our suppliers or our competitors  changes in estimates by securities analysts of our future financial performance  and general market conditions 
in addition  the stock market has recently experienced significant downward price fluctuations 
over the past several years  companies in the technology sector  such as datalink  have experienced more stock price volatility than companies in other sectors of the market and may be more vulnerable to price declines in the event of a general market decline 
we may be liable for warranty claims 
products we offer may contain defects in hardware  software or workmanship that remain undetected or that may not become apparent until after commercial shipment 
if a supplier were to fail to meet its warranty obligations to us  we might be liable to our customers 
we do not maintain insurance for these expenses 
we cannot assure you that our suppliers will be willing or able to honor their warranties  that we may not incur our own uninsured warranty costs or that our repair and maintenance subcontractors will perform their services in a timely and proper manner 
our governing documents and minnesota law may discourage the potential acquisitions of our business 
our board of directors may issue up additional shares of capital stock and establish their rights  preferences and classes  in some cases without stockholder approval 
in addition  we are subject to anti takeover provisions of minnesota law 
these provisions may deter or discourage takeover attempts and other changes in control of us not approved by our board of directors 
if potential acquirers are deterred  you may lose an opportunity to profit from a possible acquisition premium in our stock price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we do not believe that we have any material market risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required 
the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
interest rate risk 
as of december   we had million of cash and money market accounts 
a decrease in market rates of interest would have no material effect on the value of these assets 
we have no short or long term debt with variable interest rates 
therefore  an increase in market rates would not significantly affect our financial results 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we develop and sell all of our products in the united states 
therefore  we are not currently exposed to any direct foreign currency exchange rate risk 
equity price risk 
we do not own any equity investments 
therefore  we are not currently exposed to any direct equity price risk
