the following discussion and analysis of the corporation s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the corporation s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview the corporation is a leading contract service organization cso that provides testing and development  and manufacturing services for biologics and other biomedical products to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies worldwide 
the corporation follows statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
under sfas  the corporation reports the results of two operating segments testing and development services and manufacturing services 
the corporation evaluates the performance of these operating segments based on revenue and gross profit 
the corporation also reports separately the results of its us operations and european operations 
bioreliance enters into several different types of contractual relationships with its clients 
contracts in the testing and development business can be quotations  based upon established price lists for individual services  or work proposals  most often for larger studies composed of a variety of services 
a majority of testing and development contracts range in length from a few weeks to several months  however  some stability testing and lot release testing contracts may be one to three years in length 
manufacturing contracts tend to be relatively long because of the length of time required to create and characterize cell banks  perform pilot production runs  and produce and test the products 
these contracts require a formal statement of work and range in length from six months to over two years 
government contracts  usually multi year  are consistent with the requirements of the particular granting agency 
clients generally are invoiced either as work is completed or  for contracts in excess of  with a payment at the commencement of the services and progress payments based on defined milestones 
contracts may be terminated for a variety of reasons  including the client s decision to forego a particular study or to cancel or delay particular product development program  the failure of a clinical trial or unexpected or undesired results of product testing  or by the government for convenience 
generally  service contracts may be canceled by the client upon notice  with a partial charge commensurate with the percentage of work completed at the time of cancellation 
for both testing and development services and manufacturing services  the major components of cost of sales are labor and related fringe benefits  facilities  primarily rent or depreciation  utilities and maintenance  direct materials  overhead costs  such as travel  office expenses and employee related expenses  consulting costs and subcontracted costs 
cost of sales includes these expenses for laboratories directly providing the services and for supporting services departments  principally regulatory affairs  quality assurance and quality control 
in relative proportion to the total cost of sales  labor and materials costs are greater and facilities costs are less for testing and development services than for manufacturing services 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of labor and related fringe benefits  administrative materials  travel  legal  consulting  costs related to managing investor relations  and bad debt expense 
in addition  a portion of facilities and information systems costs are allocated to general and administrative departments 
research and development expense consists primarily of labor and related fringe benefits  materials  travel  and a portion of facilities cost 
critical accounting policies the corporation s critical accounting policies are listed below 
these policies are particularly important to the portrayal of the corporation s financial position and its results of operations and require management s significant judgment 
as a result  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from commercial contracts  which are principally fixed price or fixed rate  and record it predominantly using a percentage of completion method  except for services that are generally completed within three days which are accounted for using the completed contract method 
we determine percentage of completion over time using total project costs as a cost input measure 
the percentage of completion may be affected by future events  including delays caused by laboratory interruptions  client mandated changes and the unpredictability of biological processes 
accordingly  the corporation undertakes a review process to determine that recorded revenue represents the actual percentage of completion in all material respects 
revenue recorded under the percentage of completion method for projects in process is not intended to and does not necessarily represent the amount of revenue that could be recovered from the client if any project were cancelled or failed 
the corporation undertakes a review of unbilled accounts receivable from customers to determine that such amounts are expected to become billable and collectible in all material respects 
revenue recognized from government contracts  which are principally cost plus fixed fee  is recognized in an amount equal to reimbursable costs plus a pro rata portion of the earned fee 
losses are provided for at the time at which they become known 
income taxes we follow statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under the asset and liability method of sfas  deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities by applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we provide valuation allowances if it is anticipated that some or all of a deferred tax asset may not be realized 
foreign currency translation we measure the accounts of foreign subsidiaries using local currency as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at period end exchange rates  and income and expense accounts are translated at average monthly exchange rates 
net gains and losses resulting from such translations are excluded from net income loss and are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders equity 
gains or losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred 
the corporation s accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations dollars in tables are in thousands for the year ended december   the corporation had gross revenue of million  and increase of over gross revenue of million for the year ended december  earnings per share for were diluted  compared with diluted in year ended december  compared with year ended december  gross revenue by segment the following table shows a comparison of revenue by operational segment for the years ended december  and years ended december  change testing and development manufacturing total the increase in testing and development revenue for the year ended december  is primarily due to the continued increase in the rate of new orders in both the us and europe 
the increase in us testing and development revenue resulted from increases in biosafety testing services and toxicology services  partially offset by a decrease in revenue in analytical services 
the increase in european testing and development revenue was driven by increases in revenue generated in all major service areas 
the increase in manufacturing revenue in is attributable to increases in both us and european manufacturing revenue 
the us increase is primarily attributable to an increase in orders for phase iii large scale manufacturing services  and strong performance under existing contracts for phase i ii small scale manufacturing services 
project delays resulting from client requests for additional process development and regulatory issues offset some of the increase in us manufacturing revenue in price increases did not provide a significant portion of the revenue increases in either of the corporation s business segments 
approximately of us manufacturing revenue for resulted from work performed under the corporation s major smallpox vaccine contracts 
work under these contracts is subject to government and prime contractor issued task orders  contract amendments and potential expansion and acceleration  thus  the related revenues cannot be predicted with certainty 
as with all government contracts  these contracts are subject to termination by the government at any time 
the following table shows a comparison of revenue by geographic region for the years ended december  and years ended december  change united states europe total the increase in revenue generated in the united states for the year ended december  resulted from increases in orders  which fueled increased revenue for both the testing and development and manufacturing segments 
the increase in revenue generated in europe for the year ended december  reflects ratable increases in revenue generated from all sectors uk testing and development services  uk manufacturing services and german manufacturing services 
the corporation expects that testing and development revenue will continue to increase in the foreseeable future  and it expects that manufacturing revenue in the us will increase with the corporation s new vaccine contracts  but there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
the company is planning for laboratory expansions that would become available to meet anticipated growth in the us and europe 
german manufacturing services are currently running near capacity  and  therefore  further revenue growth in that facility will likely be modest  if at all  for the next year 
these expectations could be adversely affected by factors noted in the cautionary statements on page and the risk factors beginning on page gross profit the following table compares gross profit and gross margin by operational segment for the years ended december  and years ended december  change testing and development gross profit gross margin manufacturing gross profit gross margin totals gross profit gross margin the increase in testing and development gross margins for the year ended december  was driven by increased gross profit generated in both the us and the us increased revenue was only partially offset by an increase in variable costs relating to labor and direct materials 
the improvement in manufacturing gross margins for the year ended december  is related to an increase in the gross profit generated in europe  partially offset by an increase in losses generated in the us the losses generated in the us increased due to increased costs for labor  direct materials and capacity costs related to the us manufacturing facility  only partially offset by an increase in revenue 
future revenue growth is expected to exceed cost increases related to the us manufacturing facility  thereby improving gross margins 
however  the build out and validation of the us manufacturing facility has demanded and will continue to demand considerable time and resources  and there are high fixed costs related to the facility 
the corporation is utilizing substantially less than full capacity in this facility 
this facility will likely constrain earnings for the corporation at least for the foreseeable future 
management cannot predict when  if ever  the facility will generate positive cash flow 
without the results of operations of this facility  consolidated gross margins would have been for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  the following table compares gross profit and gross margin by geographic region for the years ended december  and years ended december  change united states gross profit gross margin europe gross profit gross margin totals gross profit gross margin the increase in us gross margins for the year ended december  resulted from increased revenue in both the testing and development and manufacturing segments  only partially offset by increased cost of sales related to the us manufacturing facility  discussed above  and the increased cost of sales resulting from the cost of labor and materials for the testing and development segment 
without the results of operations of the us manufacturing facility  us gross margins would have been for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  the improvement in european gross margins for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to increased profit generated by both the testing and development and manufacturing segments  resulting from continued efficient utilization of capacity and higher revenue 
the corporation expects margins in the testing and development segment  both in the us and europe  to improve slightly with economies of scale in the foreseeable future 
these projected improvements could be adversely affected by factors noted in the cautionary statements on page and the risk factors beginning on page operating expenses the following table shows a comparison of operating expenses  other than cost of sales  for the years ended december  and years ended december  change selling  general and administrative research and development total the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  is due primarily to an increase in labor and selling expenses  partially offset by a decrease in the provision for bad debt expense 
labor costs increased as we added new employees to fill administrative positions and as we recorded a higher expense for compensation programs based on corporate and divisional unit performances 
the increases in labor costs were largely offset by favorable adjustments  which are not expected to recur 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in over would have been greater  but for several non recurring items included in selling  general and administrative expenses for these non recurring items were restructuring charges related to the corporation s german manufacturing facility and consulting fees paid to two members of the corporation s board of directors during selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase as the corporation hires additional administrative staff  implements additional client oriented applications for its information systems and makes additional investments for technical sales support and its marketing infrastructure 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease is attributable to the success of the corporation s continuing cost management and efficiency programs and the increases in total revenue 
research and development expenses represent the investment of internal resources to develop new methods and tests to support the corporation s services 
the decrease in these expenses is related to a shift in the corporate priorities from undertaking longer term research projects to the development of tests that can be delivered to clients in a relatively shorter period 
the corporation expects these expenses to continue to decrease as it refocuses its research and development on shorter term projects  the results of which are expected to result in greater efficiency in future periods 
income taxes and other expenses the following table shows a comparison of non operating expenses for the years ended december  and three months ended december  change net interest and other expense income taxes provision effective rate the increase in net interest and other expense for the year ended december  reflects a decrease in interest income  only partially offset by a decrease in other expense 
interest expense remained relatively constant 
the decrease in interest income is a result of the decrease in interest rates 
interest expense was affected by a decrease in the corporation s capital lease obligations and a decrease in the interest rates  partially offset by increased interest expense resulting from the discontinuation of the capitalization of interest related to the us manufacturing facility in the decrease in other expense is primarily attributable to other income derived from two state of maryland grants 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  is a result of tax credits and carryforwards  which the corporation utilized in the corporation expects tax rates in to revert to levels less than but more in line with the corporation s historical rates in the approximate range of 
since the corporation has international operations  its effective tax rate may vary from year to year due to changes in the distribution of its pre tax earnings and the change in estimated annual income 
on october   the corporation effected a tax free plan of reorganization 
in the reorganization  bioreliance testing and development  inc  a subsidiary of bioreliance corporation  merged into bioreliance manufacturing  inc  also a subsidiary of bioreliance corporation 
after the merger  bioreliance manufacturing  inc contributed a portion of its assets and liabilities to a newly formed limited liability company llc  bioreliance testing and development  llc 
bioreliance manufacturing  inc then merged into bioreliance viral manufacturing  inc  also a subsidiary of bioreliance corporation 
after the merger  bioreliance viral manufacturing contributed a portion of its assets and liabilities formerly the assets and liabilities of bioreliance manufacturing  inc to another newly formed company  bioreliance manufacturing  llc 
the reorganization was undertaken to streamline the corporation s tax structure and will result in reduced administrative filings and reporting responsibilities 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  the following table shows a comparison of revenue by operational segment for the years ended december  and years ended december  change testing and development manufacturing total the increase in testing and development revenue in was attributed primarily to increased orders in both the us and europe 
the increase in us testing and development revenue resulted from increases in biosafety testing services and analytical services 
the increase in european testing and development was attributable to an increase in revenues generated in the uk  partially offset by a decrease in revenues generated in germany 
the corporation benefited from the establishment of new client relationships as well as the strengthening of existing relationships in these areas 
price increases did not provide a highly significant portion of the revenue increases in either of the corporation s business segments 
the increase in manufacturing revenues in was the result of significant increases in europe and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the us the us increase is primarily attributable to an increase in manufacturing revenue for both phase i ii and phase iii services 
the increase in phase iii manufacturing revenue was a result of the corporation s opening of its new manufacturing facility during project delays resulting from requirements for additional process development and other client decisions  prior to completion of work  adversely affected us manufacturing revenue in the second half of the year 
during the third quarter of  bioreliance announced its selection as the principal provider of manufacturing services for a smallpox vaccine for military purposes and  separately  a teaming agreement to provide large scale manufacturing services for a new smallpox vaccine to create a national civil defense stockpile 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation announced that it was awarded a contract for the development and production of viral vectors to be used to test novel gene therapies 
these contracts have terms of up to years 
like all government contracts  these contracts are subject to termination by the government at any time 
the following table shows a comparison of revenue by geographic region for the years ended december  and years ended december  change united states europe total the increase in revenue generated in the united states for the year ended december  resulted from an increase in orders in both the testing and development and manufacturing segments 
this was achieved in part by having a full complement of account managers both in the us and europe 
us testing and development revenue was positively impacted by increased revenue generated in its toxicology and biosafety laboratories 
the increase in manufacturing revenue can be attributed to growth in orders and the resultant revenue for both phase i ii and phase iii services 
price increases did not provide a highly significant portion of the revenue increases in either of the corporation s geographic regions 
the increase in revenue generated in europe for the year ended december  reflected increases in both the testing and development and manufacturing revenue 
the increase in testing and development revenue generated in europe for year ended december  was related to an increase in testing and development revenue generated in the uk  partially offset by a decrease in testing and development revenue in germany 
during the second quarter of  the corporation began the consolidation of german testing and development services into its stirling  scotland uk operations 
european manufacturing revenue also increased in  as the corporation benefited from a strong performance from its manufacturing services in germany 
the following table compares gross profit and gross margin by operational segment for the years ended december  and years ended december  change testing and development gross profit gross margin manufacturing gross profit gross margin totals gross profit gross margin the increase in testing and development gross margin for the year ended december  can be attributed to increased gross profit generated in both the us and europe 
the increase was partially offset by increases in costs for labor  fringe benefits  direct materials  depreciation and non recurring subcontracting costs related to one development project 
the decrease in margins generated by manufacturing services was related to an increase in losses generated in us manufacturing partially offset by an increase in the gross profit generated in europe 
gross profit decreased as a result of increased costs for labor  fringe benefits  direct materials and capacity costs related to the new us manufacturing facility 
the following table compares gross profit and gross margin by geographic region for the years ended december  and years ended december  change united states gross profit gross margin europe gross profit gross margin totals gross profit gross margin the increase in gross profit for the year ended december   for the united states resulted from increased revenue  partially offset by increased cost of sales in both testing and development and manufacturing  which are as discussed above 
the improvement in the gross profit for europe for the year ended december  can be primarily attributed to improved european margins in both the testing and development and manufacturing segments  resulting from increased utilization of capacity and a more favorable revenue mix 
the following table shows a comparison of operating expenses  other than cost of sales  for the years ended december  and years ended december  change selling  general and administrative research and development total the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  was due primarily to a decrease in labor and fringe costs due to fewer administrative employees and a decrease in the provision for bad debt expense  partially offset by an increase in consulting expenses 
bad debt expense decreased because of an improvement in the accounts receivable aging resulting from improved and enhanced collection efforts in the decrease was partially offset by restructuring expenses of million related to the consolidation of testing and development operations in germany with uk operations and consulting fees 
research and development expenses represent the investment of internal resources to develop new methods and tests to support the corporation s services 
the following table shows a comparison of non operating expenses for the years ended december  and three months ended december  change other expense income income taxes provision benefit effective rate the increase in net interest and other expense for the year ended december  reflects increases in interest and other expense  partially offset by an increase in interest income 
the increased interest expense can be attributed to the capital lease arrangements related to the new manufacturing facility opened during the provision for income tax for the year ended december  is the result of the corporation s generation of income before income taxes 
the low effective rate in was the consequence of different accounting treatment for various tax attributes in periods of net losses 
liquidity and capital resources the corporation has funded its business through existing cash  cash flows from operations  long term bank loans and capital leases 
at december   the corporation had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  compared to million at december  marketable securities are composed of investments in government securities  government agency securities and commercial paper with original maturities of more than three months at the time of purchase 
these marketable securities totaled million at december  the corporation had no marketable securities at december  in   and  the corporation generated positive net cash flow from operating activities of million  million  and million  respectively 
net income  as adjusted for depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes and other non cash adjustments  provided cash of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
changes in other assets and liabilities provided cash of million in  as a result of an increase in customer advances  accrued employee compensation and benefits and accounts payable  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and deposits and other assets and a decrease in other accrued liabilities 
changes in other assets and liabilities provided cash of million in  primarily due to an increase in other accrued liabilities and customer advances  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable 
in changes in other assets and liabilities provided cash of million in  primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in accrued employee compensation and benefits  partially offset by decreases in customer advances  other accrued liabilities and an increase in deposits and other assets 
working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase was due to an increase in current assets partially offset by an increase in current liabilities 
the increase in current assets resulted from an increase in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and an increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in current liabilities is the result of increases in customer advances  accrued employee compensation and benefits  and deferred income taxes 
the current portion of long term debt decreased as of december  because the corporation repaid the balance of a note payable and several of the corporation s capital equipment leases expired during the year 
bioreliance believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of million at december   forecasted operating cash flows for  and available borrowings of million under its revolving loan agreement will provide sufficient liquidity to meet the corporation s operating plan  planned capital expenditures  and interest and principal payments on the corporation s debt for a decrease in demand for the corporation s services could reduce operating cash flows  which in turn would impact liquidity 
the key factors that could affect the corporation s sources of cash include the following the corporation s ability to generate orders for new contracts  the ability of the corporation to utilize its facilities  particularly the us manufacturing facility  the size and growth of the overall markets for biopharmaceuticals  and  the economy in the us and europe 
these and other factors are more fully described in risk factors  beginning on page additionally  a deterioration in the corporation s financial ratios could accelerate the maturity of principal outstanding under the corporation s loans 
operating leases the corporation leases facilities and equipment under leases that expire at various dates through the corporation is required to make noncancelable lease payments totaling approximately million under these leases 
capital leases the corporation s manufacturing facility in rockville  maryland became operational in the second quarter of the corporation leases this facility under three capital leases that require it to make noncancelable lease payments totaling approximately million through the corporation has also guaranteed indebtedness related to the construction of this facility of approximately million at december  a portion of the lease payments is equivalent to the interest and principal due on the indebtedness 
in february  the corporation entered into an interest rate swap with respect to one of those capital leases whereby the variable interest rate portion of the indebtedness was effectively converted into debt with a fixed rate of per annum 
this swap expires on november  amounts paid or received under the interest rate swap are recognized as interest income or expense in the periods in which they accrued and are recorded in the same category as that arising from the indebtedness 
as a result of a decrease in the variable interest rate  for the year ended december   the corporation recorded  of additional interest expense related to this interest rate swap 
in accordance with sfas  the corporation recorded a liability for the change in the fair value of this swap of approximately  the corresponding amount is reflected in other comprehensive expense  as the corporation has met the criteria of sfas to record the contract as a cash flow hedge 
the corporation accounts for the leases and subleases of the manufacturing facility as capital leases 
the assets underlying the capital leases are included with the corporation s owned property and equipment as of december  property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization at december  included approximately million related to these capital leases 
the related lease obligation is included in the corporation s liabilities at december  capital expenditures during  the corporation invested approximately million in capital expenditures 
these expenditures were primarily related to leasehold improvements and equipment for the us manufacturing facility 
the corporation invested million and million in capital expenditures during and  respectively 
estimated capital expenditures of million in include capacity expansions in us biologics testing  us manufacturing  and german manufacturing 
the corporation s plans also include additional investments in information systems  as well as normal replacements 
the corporation expects to continue expanding its operations through internal growth and expansion of capacity in most or all of its operating facilities 
the corporation expects to fund its growth and its planned capital expenditures from existing cash  cash flows from operations  bank borrowings and lease or other financing from third party sources to the extent that funds are available on favorable terms and conditions 
while the corporation remains confident that expansion of its capacity will contribute to growth  there can be no assurance that such expansion will be fully utilized or that funding for the plans will meet with the corporation s expectations 
although the corporation has no agreements or arrangements in place with respect to any future acquisition  there may be acquisition or other growth opportunities that require additional external financing  and the corporation may  from time to time  seek to obtain funds from public or private issuances of equity or debt securities on a strategic basis 
there can be no assurances that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to the corporation 
see notes and of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
borrowings and credit facilities the corporation has a mortgage loan of million from bank of america with a maturity date of november  that was used to finance the construction of one of its facilities in rockville  maryland 
in addition to a monthly principal payment of  per month  the mortgage loan bears interest at the london inter bank offering rate libor plus the applicable libor rate additional percentage libor rate option 
the libor rate option ranges from to depending on the corporation achieving funded debt to ebitda ratios 
at december   the applicable interest rate on the mortgage loan was and the libor rate option was 
approximately million was outstanding on the mortgage loan at december  in february  the corporation entered into an interest rate swap whereby the variable interest rate portion of the mortgage loan was effectively converted into debt with a fixed rate of per annum 
this swap expires november  amounts paid or received under the interest rate swap were recognized as interest income or expense in the periods in which they accrued and were recorded in the same category as that arising from the mortgage loan 
as a result of a decrease in the variable interest rate  for the year ended december  the corporation recorded  of additional interest expense related to the interest rate swap 
in accordance with sfas  the corporation recorded a liability for the change in the fair value of this swap of approximately  the corresponding amount is reflected in other comprehensive expense  as the corporation has met the criteria of sfas to record the contract as a cash flow hedge 
the corporation has available borrowings up to million under the terms of a revolving loan agreement with bank of america 
the revolving loan agreement requires monthly interest payments on the unpaid principal 
the unpaid principal and all unpaid accrued interest is payable in full on may   and the line of credit expires at that time 
amounts borrowed under the revolving loan agreement bear interest at the libor rate plus the applicable libor rate option which ranges from to depending on the corporation achieving funded debt to ebitda ratios 
there were no borrowings under this agreement in or all of the corporation s agreements with bank of america are cross collateralized and are secured by a deed of trust on one of the corporation s laboratory facilities in rockville  maryland 
the agreements require the corporation to comply with financial and restrictive covenants  including fixed charge coverage and funded debt to ebitda ratios 
specifically maintain a ratio of total funded indebtedness to ebitda not greater than to as of the end of each fiscal quarter  calculated on the preceding four quarter period 
ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio as of the end of each quarter of at least to 
this ratio is determined by dividing ebitda by the sum of interest expense and current maturities of long term debt and capital leases 
at december   the corporation was in compliance with all covenants under its loan agreements 
the corporation has a million loan from the department of business and economic development  a department of the state of maryland 
the corporation is required to use the proceeds to expand and relocate its activities in rockville  maryland

the terms of the loan contain annual reporting requirements  including the reporting of employment data 
at december   approximately million remained outstanding on the loan 
contractual obligations the corporation s outstanding contractual obligations relate to its long term debt  capital lease obligations and its facility leases 
these obligations and commitments are more fully described in this annual report on form k under borrowing and credit facilities and capital leases in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in note and note to consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page f below is a table which presents the corporation s contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than years years after one year years long term debt capital lease obligations including interest operating leases total contractual cash obligations in connection with the operating lease agreements for two of its facilities  the corporation is contingently liable under two letters of credit totaling approximately million 
foreign currency the accounts of the corporation s international subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into united states dollars at period end exchange rates  and revenue and expense accounts are translated at average monthly exchange rates 
net exchange gains and losses resulting from these translations are excluded from net income and are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders equity 
translation gains and losses that arise from some intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred 
the corporation recorded net exchange losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
since the revenues and expenses of the corporation s international operations generally are denominated in local currencies  exchange rate fluctuations between such local currencies and the united states dollar will subject the corporation to currency translation risk with respect to the reported results of its international operations as well as to other risks sometimes associated with international operations 
the corporation derived  and of its revenue for  and  respectively  from services performed outside of the united states 
in addition  the corporation may be subject to currency risk when the corporation s service contracts are denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the corporation incurs expenses related to such contracts 
there can be no assurance that the corporation will not experience fluctuations in financial results from the corporation s operations outside the united states  and there can be no assurance the corporation will be able  contractually or otherwise  to reduce the currency risks associated with its operations 
at the present time  the corporation does not use derivative financial instruments to manage or control foreign currency risk because most of its revenue and related expenses are in the same functional currencies 
however  there can be no assurance that the corporation will not use such financial instruments in the future or that any such use will be successful in managing or controlling foreign currency risk 
see item a market risk the revenue and identifiable assets attributable to the corporation s geographic regions are reported in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
european monetary union within europe  the european economic and monetary union the emu introduced a new currency  the euro  on january  the new currency is in response to the emu s policy of economic convergence to harmonize trade policy  eliminate business costs associated with currency exchange and to promote the free flow of capital  goods and services 
on january   the participating countries adopted the euro as their local currency  initially available for currency trading on currency exchanges and non cash banking transactions 
on or before july   the participating countries are planned to withdraw all legacy currency and use the euro exclusively 
the introduction of the euro has not had a material adverse effect on the corporation  and it does not anticipate any material adverse effects as other currencies are phased out 
however  unforeseen legislation  changes in commercial cross border practices or a significant devaluation of the euro could have an adverse effect on the future results of operations and financial position of the corporation

risk factors dependence on outsourcing for development of biologics  market acceptance of biologics the corporation s revenue is highly dependent on research  development and manufacturing expenditures by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for the development of biologics 
the corporation has benefited to date from the growing tendency of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to outsource product development projects to csos 
a decline in the development of biologics  a general decline in research and development expenditures by these companies  or a delay or reduction in the outsourcing to csos of research and development expenditures due to market conditions  pharmaceutical industry consolidation or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business and results of operations 
the corporation s business strategy is dependent upon market acceptance of biologics 
the market for biologics is still emerging  and most biologic products are still in the research and development stage 
the extent to which biologics are accepted in commercial markets will affect the corporation s business  results of operations and financial condition 
significant capital expenditures during  the corporation invested million in capital expenditures and may spend up to million on capital expenditures during there will be no return in on a majority of the capital expenditures planned for the year 
there is a risk that the ultimate return  if any  on these capital expenditures may be less than expected 
risks associated with the nature of contracts most of the corporation s contracts are short term in duration 
as a result  the corporation must continually replace its contracts with new contracts to sustain its revenue 
the corporation s inability to generate new contracts on a timely basis would have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  many of the corporation s long term contracts may be cancelled or delayed by clients for any reason upon notice 
contracts may be terminated for a variety of reasons  including termination of product development  failure of products to satisfy safety requirements  unexpected or undesired results from use of the product or the client s decision to forego a particular study 
such terminations are somewhat common in the cso industry  and have affected the corporation s revenue in the past 
the failure to obtain new contracts or the cancellation or delay of existing contracts could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business and results of operations 
government contracts may be terminated during fiscal  approximately of the corporation s revenue was derived from government contracts and subcontracts 
a government contract or subcontract may be modified or terminated at any time for the convenience of the government  including for changes in requirements or reductions in budgetary resources 
any termination of our government contracts or subcontracts  particularly our newly awarded contracts for the manufacture of a smallpox vaccine would have a material adverse effect on our future revenue 
revenue difficult to predict the corporation s revenue is difficult to predict because it is primarily generated on a contract by contract or purchase order basis 
most of the contracts are short term  and may be canceled at any time 
consequently  the corporation does not have a significant backlog  nor is backlog a meaningful indicator of future revenue 
as a result  the corporation s revenue is not recurring from period to period  which contributes to the variability of results from period to period 
variation in quarterly operating results  high fixed costs the corporation s revenue and operating results have fluctuated  and could continue to fluctuate  on a quarterly basis 
the operating results for a particular quarter may be lower than expected as a result of a number of factors  including the timing of contracts  the delay or cancellation of a contract  the mix of services provided  seasonal slowdowns in europe during the summer months  the timing of start up expenses for new services and facilities  and changes in regulations related to biologics 
because a high percentage of the corporation s costs are fixed such as the cost of maintaining facilities and compensating employees  any one of these factors could have a significant impact on the corporation s quarterly results 
in some quarters the corporation s revenue and operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts  and investors due to any of the factors described above 
in such event  the trading price of the corporation s common stock would likely decline  even if the decline in revenue did not have any long term adverse implications for the corporation s business 
management of growth the corporation s operations both domestic and international have grown in recent years 
this growth has placed a strain on the corporation s management  operational  human and financial resources 
in order to manage its growth  the corporation must continue to improve its operating and administrative systems  including its financial and accounting systems  and continue to attract and retain qualified management and professional  scientific and technical operating personnel 
there can be no assurance that the corporation will be able to manage its growth effectively 
any failure to effectively anticipate  implement and manage the changes required to sustain its growth could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business and results of operations 
expansion of manufacturing capabilities as part of its business strategy  the corporation expanded its us manufacturing capabilities to allow for large scale production of biologics 
the corporation has not yet utilized the full capacity of its us manufacturing facility  which became operational in there can be no assurance that the corporation will be able to generate sufficient revenue from this facility and its expanded capabilities to cover the related costs 
nor is there any assurance that the corporation will find clients for its current manufacturing capacity or any manufacturing capacity it may further develop  or that the corporation will operate its manufacturing facilities on a profitable basis 
competition  industry consolidation the corporation operates in a highly competitive industry 
the cso industry is highly fragmented  with many providers ranging in size from one person consulting firms to full service global drug development corporations 
the corporation primarily competes with in house research departments of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  universities and medical centers  and other csos 
as a result of competitive pressures  the industry is consolidating 
mergers and acquisitions have resulted in the emergence of several large  full service csos that have greater capital  technical and financial resources than bioreliance 
as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies increasingly outsource development  they may increasingly turn to larger csos that provide a full range of services 
this trend is likely to produce increased competition among the larger csos for both clients and acquisition candidates and increased competitive pressures on smaller providers 
in addition  the cso industry has attracted the attention of the investment community  which could lead to heightened competition by increasing the availability of financial resources for csos 
increased competition may lead to price and other forms of competition that may have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business and results of operations 
dependence on personnel the corporation depends on a number of key executives  including capers w 
mcdonald  its president and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of any of the corporation s key executives could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business 
the corporation also depends on its ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and technical employees 
there is a significant shortage of  and intense competition for  qualified scientific and technical employees 
there can be no assurance the corporation will be able to retain its existing scientific and technical employees  or to attract and retain additional qualified employees 
the corporation s inability to attract and retain qualified scientific and technical employees would have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business and results of operations 
potential liability the corporation formulates  tests and manufactures products intended for use by the public 
in addition  the corporation s services include the manufacture of biologic products to be tested in human clinical trials 
these activities could expose the corporation to risk of liability for personal injury or death to persons using such products  although the corporation does not commercially market or sell the products to end users 
the corporation seeks to reduce its potential liability through measures such as contractual indemnification provisions with clients the scope of which may vary from client to client  and the performances of which are not secured and insurance maintained by clients 
the corporation could be materially and adversely affected if it were required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with a claim that is outside the scope of the indemnification agreements  if the indemnity  although applicable  is not performed in accordance with its terms or if the corporation s liability exceeds the amount of applicable insurance or indemnity 
in addition  the corporation could be held liable for errors and omissions in connection with the services it performs 
the corporation currently maintains product liability and errors and omissions insurance with respect to these risks 
there can be no assurance that the corporation s insurance coverage will be adequate or that insurance coverage will continue to be available on terms acceptable to the corporation 
hazardous materials the corporation s activities involve the controlled use of etiologic agents  hazardous chemicals and various radioactive materials 
the corporation is subject to foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of such materials and certain waste products 
the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of any contamination or injury from these materials  the corporation could be held liable for any damages that result  including joint and several liabilities under certain statutes such as cercla  and any such liability could exceed the resources of the corporation 
furthermore  the failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines against the corporation  suspension of production  alteration of its manufacturing processes or cessation of operations 
there can be no assurance that the corporation will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with any such laws and regulations in the future  or that such laws or regulations or liability thereunder will not have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business and results of operations 
dependence on and effect of government regulation the design  development  testing  manufacturing and marketing of biotechnology and pharmaceutical products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities  including the fda and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries 
the corporation s business depends in part on strict government regulation of the drug development process  especially in the united states 
legislation may be introduced and enacted from time to time to modify regulations administered by the fda governing the drug approval process 
any significant reduction in the scope of regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business and results of operations 
almost all of the corporation s testing assays are performed in conformity with either glp regulations or current gmp regulations 
glps and gmps are parts of the fda regulations and guidelines governing the development and production of biologic and pharmaceutical products 
failure by the corporation to comply with applicable requirements could result in the disqualification of data for client submissions to regulatory authorities and could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business and results of operations 
all facilities and manufacturing techniques used for manufacturing of products for clinical use or for sale in the united states must be operated in conformity with current gmp regulations 
the corporation s facilities are subject to scheduled periodic regulatory inspections to ensure compliance with gmp requirements 
a finding that the corporation had materially violated gmp requirements could result in regulatory sanctions  the disqualification of data for client submissions to regulatory authorities and a mandated closing of the corporation s facilities 
any such sanctions would have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business and results of operations

potential volatility of stock price the market price of the corporation s common stock has experienced a high degree of volatility 
the market price of the common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to variations in operating results from quarter to quarter  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  market conditions in the industry and general economic conditions 
furthermore  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may have an adverse effect on the market price of the corporation s common stock 
economic recession the corporation has not identified a significant relationship between the economic conditions and customer demand  nevertheless  an economic slowdown worldwide  or in any of our key markets  could reduce demand for our products or services 
a decrease in demand could have the effect of reducing our ability to obtain new contracts and orders or cause the cancellation or delay of existing contracts  which could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business and results of operations
