item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands factors which may affect future results the company s future operating results and financial position may be adversely affected or fluctuate substantially on a quarterly basis as a result of the difficult commercial aviation environment exacerbated by the september  terrorist attacks and the events that followed  the relatively weak worldwide economic climate and other factors  including decline in demand for the company s products and services and the ability of the company s customers to meet their financial obligations to the company  particularly in light of the poor financial condition of many of the world s commercial airlines  lack of assurance that sales to the us government  its agencies and its contractors which were approximately of total sales in fiscal  will continue at levels previously experienced  since such sales are subject to competitive bidding and government funding  access to the debt and equity capital markets to finance growth  which may be limited in light of industry conditions and company performance  changes in or noncompliance with laws and regulations that may affect certain of the company s aviation related activities that are subject to licensing  certification and other regulatory requirements imposed by the faa and other regulatory agencies  both domestic and foreign  competitors  including original equipment manufacturers  in the highly competitive aviation aftermarket industry that have greater financial resources than the company  exposure to product liability and property claims that may be in excess of the company s substantial liability insurance coverage  difficulties in being able to successfully integrate future business acquisitions  fluctuating market values for aviation products and equipment in the current aviation environment  difficulty in re leasing or selling aircraft and engines that are currently being leased on a long or short term basis and environmental proceedings as described in item critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
management of the company has made estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent liabilities to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant estimates made by management of the company include adjustments to reduce the value of inventories and equipment on or available for lease  allowance for doubtful accounts and loss accruals for aviation equipment operating leases 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the following is a summary of certain accounting policies considered critical by management of the company 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to reduce the value of customer accounts receivable to amounts expected to be collected 
in determining the required allowance  the company considers factors such as customer credit history  overall and industry economic conditions and the customer s current financial performance 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by either the specific identification  average cost or first in  first out method 
provisions are made for excess and obsolete inventories and inventories which have been impaired as a result of industry conditions 
the company has utilized certain assumptions in determining the recoverability of excess  obsolete and impaired inventories  such as the historical performance of the inventory  existing and expected future aviation usage trends  estimated market values and expected future demand 
principally as a result of the tragic events of september   the company recorded a significant charge for impaired inventories during the second quarter ended november  utilizing those assumptions 
further reductions in demand for certain of the company s inventories or declining market values  as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by the company when determining the market value of assets  would result in additional impairment charges in future periods 
critical accounting policies continued equipment on or available for lease lease revenue is recognized as earned 
the cost of the asset under lease is original purchase price plus overhaul costs 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated service life of the equipment  and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
the balance sheet classification is based on the lease term  with fixed term leases less than twelve months classified as short term and all others classified as long term 
aviation equipment operating leases the company from time to time leases aviation equipment engines and aircraft from lessors under arrangements that are classified by the company as operating leases 
the company may also sublease the aviation equipment to a customer on a short or long term basis 
the terms of the operating leases in which the company is the lessee are one year with options to renew annually at the election of the company for up to four years 
if the company elects not to renew a lease  the company may elect either to i direct the lessor to sell the equipment at which time the company would be required to reimburse the lessor for the shortfall  if any  between the proceeds on the sale and the scheduled purchase option price  or ii purchase the equipment from the lessor at its scheduled purchase option price 
the terms of the lease agreements also allow the company to purchase the equipment at any time during a lease at its scheduled purchase option price 
in those instances in which the company anticipates that it will purchase aviation equipment and that the scheduled purchase option price will exceed estimated undiscounted cash inflows related to the equipment  the company records an accrual for loss 
results of operations the company reports its activities in four business segments inventory and logistic services  maintenance  repair and overhaul  manufacturing and aircraft and engine sales and leasing 
the table below sets forth consolidated sales for the company s four business segments for each of the last three fiscal years ended may for the year ended may  sales inventory and logistic services    maintenance  repair and overhaul    manufacturing    aircraft and engine sales and leasing    three year sales summary over the last three fiscal years  consolidated sales  excluding pass through sales  decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal total sales  which include pass through sales  declined from  in fiscal to  in fiscal during fiscal  the company experienced lower demand for its products and services from its commercial airline customers as those customers experienced a decline in profitability as a result of an overall economic slowdown and higher fuel prices 
sales were also lower in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the mutual agreement with a major customer to unwind an engine parts inventory management program in mid fiscal as a result of the tragic events of september   which occurred at a time when the worldwide commercial airline environment was already under significant pressure principally due to the aforementioned weak worldwide economic conditions  most of the major us based commercial airlines announced substantial reductions in capacity  some in excess of 
commercial airlines accelerated their older generation aircraft fleet retirement plans 
the reduction in capacity and the financial impact of september  on the company s commercial airline customers had a dramatic effect on the company s fiscal operating results when compared to fiscal and more recently  three major us commercial airlines have announced restructuring plans as a result of the continuing difficult economic conditions in the airline industry 
one has filed bankruptcy as part of its restructuring plans and another has warned that it may have to do so 
these restructurings are likely to result in further reductions in industry capacity 
the company will review its business lines and capacity and take appropriate actions consistent with changing industry demands 
fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated sales in fiscal  excluding pass through sales  decreased  or compared to fiscal as the company experienced lower sales in three of its four segments 
in the inventory and logistic services segment  fiscal sales declined  or primarily as a result of lower demand for engine and airframe parts from the company s customers due to reduced airline capacity  including the accelerated retirement of older generation aircraft  partially offset by increased sales of spares and logistic support for the us military and its contractors 
the decline in engine parts sales was also due to lower sales to a major program customer for certain engine parts due principally to the impact of the dissolution of the company s exclusive engine parts support agreement with this major customer  which occurred in december the elimination of pass through sales was also attributable to this factor 
in the maintenance  repair and overhaul segment  sales decreased  or primarily due to the reduction in airline capacity  partially offset by the favorable full year impact of sales of hermetic  which the company acquired on september  fiscal and revenues for hermetic included in consolidated sales were approximately  and  respectively 
in the manufacturing segment  sales increased  or as the company experienced increased shipments of products supporting the us military s tactical deployment requirements  partially offset by lower sales of the company s cargo loading systems 
sales in the aircraft and engine sales and leasing segment declined  or primarily due to the commercial aviation industry wide reduction in capital asset investment activity reflecting the difficult commercial airline environment  including lack of available financing and fluctuating market values for aircraft and engines 
prior to september  the company was executing its plan to reduce its investment in support of older generation aircraft in line with the commercial airlines scheduled retirement plans for these aircraft 
the events of september caused a severe and sudden disruption in the commercial airline industry which brought about a rapid acceleration of those retirement plans 
system wide capacity had been reduced by approximately and many airlines cancelled or deferred new aircraft deliveries 
based on management s assessment of these and other conditions  the company reduced the value and provided loss accruals for certain of its inventories and equipment leases which support older generation aircraft by  during the three month period ended november  this charge is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations as cost of sales impairment charges 
in addition  the company recorded other charges of  during the three month period ended november  principally related to an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect its inability to recover certain accounts receivable 
this charge is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations as special charges 
consolidated gross profit before consideration of impairment charges decreased  or as a result of lower sales and a reduction in the consolidated gross profit margin 
the reduction in the consolidated gross profit margin was principally due to margin pressure experienced in the inventory and logistic services and maintenance  repair and overhaul segments  as well as lower volume through most of the facilities within those two segments 
the aircraft and engine sales and leasing segment s gross profit percentage increased over the prior year due to the mix of products sold 
operating income  before consideration of impairment and other special charges  decreased  from the prior year as a result of lower gross profit  partially offset by a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses 
during fiscal  the company reduced its selling  general and administrative expenses by  or through lower personnel costs and reduced discretionary spending 
interest expense decreased  over the prior year principally as a result of lower average short term borrowings outstanding during the year and interest income increased  over the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in average cash invested 
the company s effective income tax benefit rate for fiscal was and includes a  reduction in income tax expense representing the reversal of federal income tax liabilities 
the company recorded a net loss of  during fiscal due to the factors discussed above 
fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated sales in fiscal  excluding pass through sales  decreased  or compared to the prior year as the company experienced lower sales in three of its four segments 
in the inventory and logistic services segment  fiscal sales declined  or compared to fiscal primarily as a result of lower sales of engine parts and components 
the decline in engine parts sales was primarily the result of reduced demand by a major customer for certain engine parts due principally to fewer engine shop visits to this customer for the engine types the company supports  and from the impact of converting the company s exclusive engine parts support agreement with this major customer to preferred status  which occurred in december the reduction in pass through sales of  also was attributable to these factors 
in the maintenance  repair and overhaul segment  fiscal sales increased over the prior year  or  primarily as a result of the favorable impact of the sales of hermetic  which the company acquired on september  fiscal revenues for hermetic included in consolidated sales were approximately  sales in the manufacturing segment declined  or compared to fiscal primarily as a result of lower sales of products supporting the us government s rapid deployment program  and lower sales of the company s cargo systems and composite structure products 
in the aircraft and engine sales and leasing segment  sales declined  or compared to fiscal primarily as a result of lower revenue in the company s aircraft sales business 
the decline in aircraft sales is mainly due to the type of aircraft sold in fiscal compared to those sold in fiscal consolidated gross profit decreased  or over the prior year due to the impact of lower sales and a reduction in the consolidated gross profit margin 
the decline in the gross profit margin was attributable to lower margins in the inventory and logistic services segment due to pricing pressure on older technology engine parts and reduced demand from a major inventory management program customer 
gross profit margins were also lower in the manufacturing segment reflecting lower demand for certain of the company s manufactured products 
the consolidated gross profit margin was also negatively impacted by a  provision recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal to adjust certain inventories previously used to support the major program customer to their net realizable value 
selling  general and administrative costs declined  or reflecting lower personnel costs as the company reduced its cost structure in response to more difficult industry conditions 
selling  general and administrative expense declined also as a result of lower bad debt expense in fiscal compared to the prior year 
interest expense decreased  principally as a result of reduced average short term borrowings outstanding during fiscal interest income declined as a result of the reduction in average outstanding interest bearing trade notes receivable during the current year compared to the prior year 
the company s effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the fiscal provision for income taxes includes a reduction in income tax expense of  this adjustment represents the reversal of federal and state income tax accrued liabilities for years prior to fiscal  which are now closed to assessments 
consolidated net income declined  as a result of the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has funded its growth  met its contractual commitments and paid dividends through the generation of cash from operations  augmented by the periodic issuance of common stock and debt to the public and private markets 
the company also relies on its unsecured bank credit arrangements  an accounts receivable securitization program and finances certain aviation equipment with operating leases to provide additional liquidity 
although the company successfully completed a private placement of long term debt in june and a common stock offering in february  the company s ability to issue debt  borrow from its lenders or sell equity securities in the future may be negatively affected by a number of factors  including general economic conditions  aviation industry conditions and company performance 
the company s ability to use the accounts receivable securitization program and aviation equipment operating leases is also dependent on those factors 
the company s ability to generate cash from operations is influenced primarily by the operating performance of the company 
at may   the company s liquidity and capital resources included cash of  and working capital of  at may   the company s ratio of long term debt to capitalization was  up from at may  and at may   the company s ratio of total debt to capitalization was compared to at may  the increase in the long term debt to capitalization ratio is primarily attributable to the reduction in stockholders equity as a result of the impairment and special charges recorded in the second quarter ended november  the company continues to maintain its external sources of financing  including committed bank lines and a universal shelf registration on file with the securities and exchange commission under which  subject to market conditions  up to  of common stock  preferred stock or medium or long term debt securities may be issued or sold 
at may   aggregate committed unsecured bank credit arrangements were  of this amount   was available under revolving credit and term loan agreements with four domestic banks and  was available under credit agreements with one foreign bank 
borrowings outstanding under these arrangements were  and at may  and  respectively 
two of the domestic credit agreements have commitment amounts that reduce by  each every six months  beginning june  until the time of their maturity 
the aggregate commitment amounts of the domestic bank credit arrangements are as follows date of availability amount may   june   october   december   april   june   december   to permit the company to finance future growth  the company is actively considering various financing alternatives which  depending on market conditions and the availability of capital  may include the issuance of debt or equity securities 
the company has an accounts receivable securitization program under which the company may sell an interest in a defined pool of accounts receivable 
cash proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable  net of retained interest  under this arrangement were  and  at may  and may  respectively 
this resulted in a reduction of accounts receivable in those amounts on the may  and may  consolidated balance sheets 
during the twelve month period ended may   the company increased its cash position by  the increase in cash from may  principally reflects the issuance of a  private placement of long term debt in june  a common stock offering in february which provided the company with net proceeds of  and an increase in borrowings under its bank lines of  the increase to cash was partially offset by a final cash payment of  for the acquisition of hermetic and the repayment of  in notes on november  also contributing to the net change in the company s cash position were capital expenditures of  cash dividends of  and cash used in operating activities of  during the twelve month period ended may   the company s operations used  of cash  principally reflecting investments in equipment on long term lease and inventories  partially offset by a reduction in accounts receivable 
during the twelve month period ended may   the company s investing activities used  of cash  primarily reflecting capital expenditures of  and the final cash payment for the hermetic acquisition of  which was due and paid on june  during the twelve month period ended may   the company s financing activities generated  of cash  primarily reflecting net proceeds from the common stock offering of  the issuance of  of long term notes and an increase in borrowings under the company s bank lines of  this was partially offset by the payment of the company s  notes on november  and cash dividends of  a summary of long term debt  non cancelable operating lease commitments for aviation equipment  bank borrowings and accounts receivable securitization as of may  is as follows payments due by period total within one year within two years within three years within four years within five years beyond five years on balance sheet long term debt      bank borrowings    off balance sheet aviation equipment operating leases    facilities and equipment operating leases    accounts receivable securitization program   notes at may   the company had committed bank lines of  of which  had been drawn and  utilized for letters of credit  leaving unused available committed bank lines of  the maturity dates for the lines of credit drawn are october   april  and february  the accounts receivable securitization program expires on august   however  on an annual basis  the financial institution has the option to not renew funding of the program 
the financial institution has informed the company that it does not wish to renew funding of the program effective november  the company is in discussions with other financial institutions regarding funding this program 
the company routinely issues letters of credit  performance bonds or credit guarantees in the ordinary course of its business 
these instruments are typically issued in conjunction with insurance contracts or other business requirements 
the total of these instruments outstanding at may  was approximately  forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain statements relating to future results  which are forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are based on beliefs of company management  as well as assumptions and estimates based on information currently available to the company  and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated  depending on a variety of factors  including those factors discussed under this item entitled factors which may affect future results 
should one or more of those risks or uncertainties materialize adversely  or should underlying assumptions or estimates prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those described 
those events and uncertainties are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many are beyond the company s control

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk includes fluctuating interest rates under its unsecured bank credit agreements  foreign exchange rates and accounts receivable 
see item critical accounting policies for a discussion on accounts receivable exposure 
during fiscal and  the company did not utilize derivative financial instruments to offset these risks 
at may    was available under credit lines with domestic banks under revolving credit and term loan agreements  and  was available under credit agreements with foreign banks credit facilities 
interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facilities is libor based 
as of may   the outstanding balance under these agreements was  a hypothetical percent increase to the average interest rate under the credit facilities applied to the average outstanding balance during fiscal would have reduced the company s pre tax income by approximately during fiscal revenues and expenses of the company s foreign operations in the netherlands are translated at average exchange rates during the year and balance sheet accounts are translated at year end exchange rates 
balance sheet translation adjustments are excluded from the results of operations and are recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
a hypothetical percent devaluation of foreign currencies against the us dollar would not have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the company
