as of september   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases 
in april  we entered into a lease agreement on two buildings for our corporate headquarters 
the lease commenced in july on the first building  and the lease on the second building commenced in october the lease for both buildings expires in with an option for renewal 
the lease for the second building has been fully subleased through we established a restricted escrow account in connection with this lease agreement 
under the term of the lease  a million certificate of deposit is required through november  unless the lease is terminated before then 
this amount has been included on our balance sheet as a component of restricted cash 
contractual obligations reflected in the following table are net of anticipated sublease income 
payments due by period in thousands less than after obligations total year years years years net operating leases critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the guidance provided under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  sec staff accounting bulleting sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  and sop no 
modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
we sell products through resellers  original equipment manufacturers oem and other channel partners  as well as directly to end users  under similar terms 
we recognize product revenue upon shipment  net of estimated returns  provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
product revenues from oem agreements are recognized based on reporting of sales from the oem partner 
typically a software license  hardware  installation and post contract customer support pcs elements are combined into a package with a single bundled price 
a portion of the sales price is allocated to each element of the bundled package based on their respective fair values as determined when the individual elements are sold separately 
revenues from the license of software are recognized when the software has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the software 
when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns  we recognize revenue when such rights lapse 
revenues for pcs are recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term 
pcs includes rights to upgrades  when and if available  a limited period of telephone support  updates  and bug fixes 
installation revenue is recognized when the product has been installed at the customer s site 
consulting services are customarily billed at fixed rates  plus out of pocket expenses  and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed 
training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed 
our ordinary payment terms to our domestic customers are net days 
our ordinary payment terms to our international customers are net to days based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual markets 
we have offered extended payment terms beyond ordinary terms to some customers 
for these arrangements  revenue is recognized when payments become due 
reserve for doubtful accounts 
estimates are used in determining our allowance for bad debts and are based on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy  specific identification and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
in determining these percentages  we evaluate historical write offs of our receivables  current trends in the credit quality of our customer base  as well as changes in the credit policies 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require any collateral 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  the recoverability of amounts due could be adversely affected 
reserve for product returns 
sales returns are estimated based on historical experience by type of product and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized 
in some instances  product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing limited rights of return 
accordingly  we reduce revenue recognized for estimated future returns at the time the related revenue is recorded 
when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns  revenue is recognized when such rights lapse 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns  inventory in the distribution channel  and other related factors 
it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates and that the amounts of such changes could seriously harm our business 
reserve for obsolete excess inventory 
we currently reduce the carrying value of inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
reserve for warranties 
our warranty reserve is established based on our historical experience and best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
fasb addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from acquisition  construction or development  and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial statements 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this report  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and its business 
our success depends on sales of our big ip we currently derive approximately of our net revenues from sales of our big ip product line 
in addition  we expect to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of big ip in the future 
implementation of our strategy depends upon big ip being able to solve critical network availability and performance problems of our customers 
if big ip is unable to solve these problems for our customers  our business and results of operations will be seriously harmed 
our success depends on our timely development of new products and features we expect the internet traffic management market to be characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes  and for those products and features to be accepted by our existing and target customers 
if we are unable to identify  develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis  or if those products do not gain market acceptance  our business and results of operations may be seriously harmed 
we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging internet traffic market our markets are new  rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future 
our principal competitors in the internet traffic market include cisco systems  foundry networks  nortel networks and radware 
we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter the internet traffic management market 
in addition  larger companies with significant resources  brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing internet traffic management solutions and emerge as significant competitors 
potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products 
potential customers may also choose to purchase additional or larger servers instead of our products 
our quarterly operating results are volatile and may cause our stock price to fluctuate our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and will vary significantly in the future  which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results 
in particular  we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts 
a delay in the recognition of revenue  even from just one account  may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period 
in the past  a significant portion of our sales has been realized near the end of a quarter 
accordingly  a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter 
furthermore  we base our decisions regarding our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends and our expense levels are relatively fixed 
consequently  if revenue levels fall below our expectations  our net income will decrease because only a small portion of our expenses vary with our revenues 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in some future quarter or quarters 
our failure to meet these expectations will likely seriously harm the market price of our common stock 
the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase  which may negatively impact gross profits we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors 
therefore  in order to maintain our gross profits  we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs 
our failure to do so will cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline  which will seriously harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 
it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle our products have a lengthy sales cycle  which is difficult to predict 
historically  our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months 
sales of big ip and dns require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits 
the sale of our products is subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting  approval and competitive evaluation processes that large corporations and governmental entities may require 
for example  customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase 
customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us 
as a result  our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 
we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships our sales strategy requires that we establish and maintain multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally through leading industry resellers  original equipment manufacturers  systems integrators  internet service providers and other channel partners 
we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels  and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships 
during fiscal no single reseller or customer exceeded of net revenue or our accounts receivable balance 
if we are unable to establish and maintain our indirect sales channels  our business and results of operations will be seriously harmed 
our expansion into international markets may not succeed we intend to continue expanding into international markets 
international sales represented of our net revenues for the year ended september   of our net revenues for the year ended september  and of our net revenues for the year ended september  we have engaged sales personnel in australia  europe  and asia pacific 
our continued growth will require further expansion of our international operations in selected countries in the european and asia pacific markets 
if we are unable to expand our international operations successfully and in a timely manner  our business and results of operations may be seriously harmed 
such expansion may be more difficult or take longer than we anticipate  and we may not be able to successfully market  sell  deliver and support our products internationally 
our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce as our international sales increase  our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks 
these risks include risks related to foreign currency exchange rates  managing foreign sales offices  regulatory  political  or economic conditions in specific countries  changes in laws and tariffs  inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in foreign countries  foreign regulatory requirements  and natural disasters 
all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to attract  train and retain qualified marketing and sales  professional services and customer support personnel our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  product development  sales  marketing and finance personnel  many of who may be difficult to replace 
the complexity of our internet traffic and content management products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support  as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort  requires us to retain highly trained professional services  customer support and sales personnel 
in spite of the economic downturn  competition for qualified professional services  customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products 
our ability to retain and hire these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in our stock price  since these employees are generally granted stock options 
the loss of services of any of our key personnel  the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel  may seriously harm our business and results of operations 
our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products we rely on third party contract manufacturers to assemble our products 
we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to a contract manufacturer who assembles these hardware platforms to our specifications 
we have experienced minor delays in shipments from our contract manufacturers in the past  which have not had a material impact on our results of operations 
we may experience delays in the future or other problems  such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product  any of which may seriously harm our business and results of operations 
the inability of our contract manufacturer to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of our contract manufacturer may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may seriously harm our business and results of operations 
if the demand for our products grows  we will need to increase our material purchases  contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions 
any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue  may seriously harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 
our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our third party sources we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from limited sources 
lead times for these components vary significantly 
any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components  or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time  will seriously harm our business and results of operations 
undetected software errors may seriously harm our business and results of operations software products frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have experienced these errors in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades 
we expect that these errors will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments 
these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems 
we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors 
while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability  these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted 
a material product liability claim may seriously harm our business and results of operations 
our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors 
as a result  when problems occur in a network  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
the occurrence of software errors  whether caused by our products or another vendor s products  may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products 
the occurrence of any of these problems may seriously harm our business and results of operations 
we may not adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
from time to time  third parties may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights claims or initiate litigation against us or our contract manufacturers  suppliers or customers with respect to existing or future products 
our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers for infringement actions related to our technology  which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers 
we may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors 
any of these claims  with or without merit  may be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology  develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement and our failure or inability to develop non infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis  our business and results of operations may be seriously harmed
