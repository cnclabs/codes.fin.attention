logility voyager solutions interfaces with software of leading erp vendors such as sap  oracle and peoplesoft 
competition we have targeted our products at emerging supply chain markets within the application software market  which is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change 
our competitors are diverse and offer a variety of solutions directed at various aspects of the value chain  as well as the enterprise as a whole 
our existing competitors include vendors focusing on the supply chain application software market  such as i technologies  manugistics  and aspen technologies 
in addition  we face potential competition from large enterprise resource planning erp application software vendors such as sap  jd edwards  peoplesoft  microsoft great plains  and oracle  each of which currently offers sophisticated erp solutions that currently  or may in the future  incorporate supply chain management modules  advanced planning and scheduling or collaboration software other business application software vendors that may broaden their product offerings by internally developing  or by acquiring or partnering with independent developers of supply chain management software internal development efforts by corporate information technology departments 
in addition  we may face competition from other application software vendors  including erp vendors that from time to time jointly market our products as a complement to their own systems 
to the extent such vendors 
table of contents develop or acquire systems with functionality comparable to our products  their significant installed customer base  long standing customer relationships and ability to offer a broad solution could provide a significant competitive advantage over our products 
we also expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the market for collaborative commerce and supply chain management software and new products and technologies are introduced 
in addition  current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
increased competition could result in fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have significant worldwide presence  longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than we have 
some competitors have become more aggressive with their prices  payment terms and issuance of contractual implementation terms or guarantees 
in order to be successful in the future  we must continue to develop innovative software solutions and respond promptly and effectively to technological change and competitors innovations 
we may also have to lower prices or offer other favorable terms 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products 
the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our products include vendor and product reputation  product architecture  functionality and features  costs  ease and speed of implementation  return on investment  product quality  price and performance  and level of support 
proprietary rights and licenses our success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon our proprietary technology 
to protect our proprietary technology  we rely on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions  which may afford only limited protection 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
although we rely on the limited protection afforded by such confidential and contractual procedures and intellectual property laws  we also believe that factors such as the knowledge  ability  and experience of our personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  reliable maintenance and timeliness and quality of support services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
we presently have no patents or patent applications pending 
the source code for our proprietary software is protected as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work 
generally copyrights on our products expire years after the year of first publication of each product 
we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and customers  and control access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
we provide our software products to customers under non exclusive license agreements 
as is customary in the software industry  in order to protect our intellectual property rights  we do not sell or transfer title to our products to our customers 
although the license agreements place restrictions on the customer s use of our products  unauthorized use of our products nevertheless may occur 
in addition  we have licensed the source code for our software to american software  which owns approximately of our common stock  on a limited basis to enable american software to perform warranty  maintenance and support obligations for certain customers  for which it is responsible under certain license agreements that were not assigned to us in connection with the formation of logility 
despite the measures taken to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to reverse engineer or copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing 
table of contents unauthorized use of our products is difficult 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in the future  we may increasingly be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
although we are not aware that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products 
in addition  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
any such claims against us  with or without merit  as well as claims initiated by us against third parties  can be time consuming and expensive to defend  prosecute or resolve 
moreover  an adverse outcome in litigation or similar adversarial proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require the expenditure of significant resources to develop non infringing technology  require a substantial amount of attention from management  require disputed rights to be licensed from others  require us to enter into royalty arrangements or require us to cease the marketing or use of certain products  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
to the extent that we desire or are required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others  there can be no assurance that any such licenses will be made available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
we have relicensed  and expect in the future to relicense  certain software from third parties for use in connection with our products 
there can be no assurance that these third party software vendors will not change their product offerings or that these software licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the termination of any such licenses or product offerings  or the failure of the third party licensors to adequately maintain or update their products  could result in delays in our ability to ship certain of our products while we seek to implement technology offered by alternative sources 
any required replacement licenses could prove costly 
further  any such delay  if it becomes extended  could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
employees as of april   we had full time employees  consisting of in sales and marketing  in product development  in customer support and implementation services and in administration and finance 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe our employee relations are good 
item properties we maintain our headquarters in atlanta  georgia 
some of our offices are occupied pursuant to the facilities agreement with american software  the terms of which are summarized in part iii  item certain relationships and related transactions  below 
we also lease space for offices in five locations in the us  as well as approximately  square feet of office space in the united kingdom
