installment note in the third quarter of  the company obtained a  installment loan from american national bank with an interest rate of per annum 
monthly installment payments of  are due on the last day of the month through july   at which time the sum of the remaining payments are due 
as part of this agreement  the bank has a security interest in the cash receipts in the company s bank accounts 
as of december   the outstanding balance of the note was approximately  of which the current portion was approximately  and the non current portion was approximately  critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies primarily relate to revenue recognition and estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue primarily from two sources i product revenue  which includes software license and ii services and support revenue  which includes software license maintenance  training  consulting and hosting revenue 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  to all transactions involving the sale of software 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we assess evidence of an arrangement based on contracts signed by both parties and delivery based on fob shipping point unless otherwise specified in the contract 
satisfaction of delivery is also assessed based on the absence of acceptance provisions in the contract or achievement of written acceptance in the event it is contractually required 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transaction is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction generally must be within days and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess collectability based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  undelivered maintenance and support  revenue is allocated to each element of multi element arrangements based on the price charged for the sale of each element separately 
for certain contracts where services are deemed essential to the functionality of the software and the software has not been accepted by the customer  the software and related service revenue have not been recognized 
in addition  all costs incurred in connection with these contracts have been expensed  as the company has been unable to estimate the total cost to achieve customer acceptance 
we recognize revenue for maintenance services ratably over the contract term 
our training and consulting services are billed based on hourly rates  and we generally recognize revenue as these services are performed 
allowance for doubtful account the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  our management must make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of december  new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which supercedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
sfas addresses how intangible assets are acquired individually or with a group of other assets but not those acquired in a business combination should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition 
sfas also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
the provisions of sfas are required to be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after december  sfas is required to be applied at the beginning of the entity s fiscal year and to be applied to goodwill and other intangible assets recognized in its financial statements at that date 
management is currently evaluating the impact that adoption of sfas will have on its consolidated financial statements but expects to have reduced amortization of  in and no effect on subsequent years  as the goodwill currently reflected in the company s financial statements would have been fully amortized 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that statement 
sfas no 
also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  it retains the requirement in opinion to report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company does not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements
