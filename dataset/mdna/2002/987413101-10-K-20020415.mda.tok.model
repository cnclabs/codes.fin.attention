going concern the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the company s certified public accountants have included an explanatory paragraph in their report which indicates there is substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company has suffered significant recurring operating losses and needs to raise additional funds to accomplish its objectives 
the company believes that its previous efforts to reduce costs and operate more efficiently  combined with the opening of the oregon wagering hub in september  and the company receipt of licensing from california in february  will improve cash flows 
however  the company will require additional capital to fund operations and pay down its liabilities  as well as to fund its expansion plans consistent with youbet 
com s anticipated changes in operations and infrastructure 
during march  the company successfully raised  in debt financing 
the company is exploring various alternatives to raise this additional capital  but there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in this regard 
to the extent that the company is unable to secure the capital necessary to fund its future cash requirements on a timely basis and or under acceptable terms and conditions  the company may not have sufficient cash resources to maintain operations 
in such event  the company may be required to consider a formal or informal restructuring or reorganization 
no adjustments have been made to the consolidated financial statements that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty
