item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  this report contains forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in these forward looking statements 
we use words such as anticipate  believe  plan  expect  future  intend and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  product development  commercialization and technology difficulties  manufacturing costs  the impact of competitive products  pricing pressures  changing customer requirements  timely availability and acceptance of new products  changes in economic conditions in the various markets we serve and those factors discussed in the section entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect management s opinions only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward looking statements 
readers should carefully review the risk factors described in other documents we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission  including the quarterly reports on form q to be filed by us in fiscal year overview from our incorporation on april  through december   we were a development stage enterprise  and our operating activities were primarily devoted to increasing our research and development capabilities  designing our hardware  developing our software and testing our products 
in march  after extensive field testing of our ip service delivery platform  we recognized revenue from product shipments to our first customers and therefore ceased to be classified as a development stage enterprise 
we market our products through our direct sales force and through resellers to service providers in asia  europe and north america 
we provide customer service and support for our products 
the market for our ip service delivery platform is new and evolving  and the volume and timing of orders are difficult to predict 
a customer s decision to purchase our platform typically involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation  testing and product qualification process 
long sales and implementation cycles for our platform may cause our revenue and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  warranties and allowances for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following accounting policies are significantly affected by the judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition most of our sales are generated from complex arrangements 
recognizing revenue in these arrangements requires our making significant judgments  particularly in the areas of collectibility and customer acceptance 
assessing the collectibility of amounts invoiced to customers is particularly critical 
to recognize revenue before we receive payment  we are required to assess that collection from the customer is probable 
if we cannot satisfy ourselves that collection is probable  we defer recognizing revenue until we have collected payment 
certain of our sales arrangements require formal acceptance by the customer 
in such cases  we do not recognize revenue until we have received formal notification of acceptance 
although we work closely with our customers to help them achieve satisfaction with our products prior to and after acceptance  the timing of customer acceptance can greatly affect the timing of our revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay our invoices 
in order to estimate the appropriate level of this allowance  we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  current customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and impact their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
inventory valuation in assessing the value of our inventory  we are required to make judgments as to future demand and then compare that demand with current inventory quantities and firm purchase commitments 
if our inventories and firm purchase commitments are in excess of forecasted demand  we write down the value of our inventory 
inventory write downs are charged to cost of sales 
during  we charged significant inventory write downs to cost of sales as the result of reduced forecasted demand for our first generation product 
if actual demand for our products is less than our forecasts  additional inventory write downs may be required 
warranties when we recognize revenue from each sale  we include estimated warranty costs in cost of sales 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  materials usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
if actual product failure rates  materials usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  adjustments to cost of sales may result 
impact of equity issuances on operating results equity issuances have a material impact on our operating results 
the equity issuances that have affected operating results to date include warrants granted to customers and suppliers  stock options granted to employees and consultants and stock issued in lieu of cash compensation to suppliers 
our revenue in and was affected significantly by warrants issued to our first three customers  qwest communications international  inc  aduronet limited and broadband office  inc these warrants were issued upon receipt of substantial purchase orders which were preceded by a period of cooperation with us in the marketing  development and refinement of our products 
for these customers revenue consists of receipts from sales  including equity issued in connection with sales  less receipts for equity issued in connection with sales 
our costs of goods sold and operating expenses are also affected significantly by charges related to warrants and options issued for services 
furthermore  some of our employee stock option transactions have resulted in deferred compensation  which is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity on our balance sheet and is amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options using the graded vesting method 
the compensation associated with shares and options relating to the following transactions is required to be remeasured at the end of each accounting period 
the remeasurement at the end of each accounting period will result in unpredictable charges or credits  to be recorded as non cash charges related to equity issuances in future periods  depending on future fluctuations in the market prices of our common stock non recourse promissory notes receivable during the fourth quarter of  we converted full recourse promissory notes received from employees upon the early exercise of unvested employee stock options to non recourse obligations 
accordingly  we are required to remeasure the compensation associated with these shares until the earlier of the shares vesting or the note being repaid 
deferred compensation expense  which is recorded at each remeasurement  is amortized over the remaining vesting period of the underlying options 
repriced stock options in july  we repriced  unexercised employee stock options to per share 
these options had previously been granted at prices ranging from to per share 
the repricing requires that compensation be remeasured for these options until they are exercised or canceled  or expire 
results of operations for the year ended december   we reported a basic and diluted net loss per common share of 
for the year ended december   the first year in which we recognized revenue  we reported a basic and diluted net loss per common share of 
for the year ended december   basic and diluted loss per common share was 
the effects of equity issuances to customers  suppliers  employees and consultants increased net loss per common share by  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in the second quarter of  one of our customers filed for bankruptcy 
as a result  the million of previously unamortized fair value of the warrants issued to that customer was written off 
approximately million was charged against revenue representing the amount of revenue previously recognized for this customer and approximately million was charged to sales and marketing expense 
revenue we recognize product revenue at the time of shipment  assuming that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable  unless we have future obligations for installation or require customer acceptance  in which case revenue is deferred until these obligations are met 
our product incorporates software that is not incidental to the related hardware and  accordingly  we recognize revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position software revenue recognition 
for arrangements that include the delivery of multiple products  the revenue is allocated to the various products based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe 
we establish vsoe based on either the price charged for the product when the same product is sold separately or for products not yet sold separately  based on the list prices of such products individually established by management with the relevant authority to do so 
revenue from post contract support obligations for specified future periods is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the service period 
revenue from consulting services is recognized as the services are provided 
amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we record estimated warranty costs based on our projections of the costs of fulfilling our warranty obligations 
for the year ended december   revenue was million  of which was from hardware sales  was from software sales and was from sales of services 
receipts from sales  including equity issued in connection with sales  were million 
for the year ended december   revenue was million  of which was from hardware sales  was from software sales and was from sales of services 
receipts from sales  including equity issued in connection with sales  were million 
from inception in april through the year ended december   we had no revenue 
below is a reconciliation of revenue for the years ended december  and as presented in our statement of operations to show the separate components as indicated in thousands receipts from sales  including equity issued in connection with sales   less receipts for equity issued in connection with sales   revenue   we issued the following warrants to customers during the year ended december  a warrant exercisable for  shares of our series c preferred stock at an exercise price of per share issued to qwest upon receipt of a purchase order from qwest for million of our products and services  a warrant exercisable for  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share issued to aduronet upon receipt of a purchase order from aduronet for million of our products and services  and a warrant exercisable for  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share issued to broadband office upon receipt of a purchase order from broadband office for million of our products and services 
broadband office filed for bankruptcy in may and subsequently we wrote off the remaining unamortized portion of this warrant 
we calculated the fair value of these customer related warrants to be million million in the case of qwest  million in the case of aduronet and million in the case of broadband office 
these values were calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  using volatility of  a risk free interest rate of and an expected life of four years 
of these amounts  million million related to qwest  million related to aduronet and million related to revenue recognized in for broadband office  as a result of broadband office s bankruptcy in was recognized as offsets to receipts from sales  including equity issued in connection with sales in determination of revenue for the year ended december   and million million related to qwest  million related to aduronet and million related to broadband office was recognized as offsets to receipts from sales  including equity issued in connection with sales in determination of revenue for the year ended december  as of december  and  we deferred million and million  respectively  of revenue from contracts that we immediately invoiced but which provide for subsequent customer acceptance  consulting services and post contract support services 
at december   there were no unamortized non cash charges relating to customer related warrants and at december   the unamortized portion of non cash charges related to warrants issued to customers was million 
non cash charges related to equity issuances during  and  we amortized million  million and million of non cash charges related to equity issuances  respectively  to cost of goods sold and operating expenses 
during the second quarter of  million was included in sales and marketing expense for the write off of the unamortized portion of broadband office s warrants due to their bankruptcy 
in relation to non recourse promissory notes  we recorded additional deferred stock compensation of  and amortization of  relating to the remeasurement of compensation associated with these unvested shares during the fourth quarter of  and recorded a reversal of deferred stock compensation related to remeasurements during of  and a reversal of amortization of  during  we recorded no deferred stock compensation in relation to repriced stock options  as the price of our stock at the end of each quarter after the repricing  was not higher than the repriced amount 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold includes all costs of producing our sold products  including the costs of outsourced manufacturing  software royalties  shipping  warranties  related manufacturing overhead costs and the costs of providing our service offerings  including personnel engaged in providing maintenance and consulting services to our customers 
to the extent that the value of inventory is written down  this will be reflected in cost of goods sold 
we have also incurred non cash charges related to equity issuances 
we have outsourced the majority of our manufacturing and repair operations 
a significant portion of our cost of goods sold consists of payments to our contract manufacturers 
we conduct manufacturing engineering  final assembly  configuration testing and documentation control at our facilities in redwood city  california 
for the year ended december   cost of goods sold was million  of which million or represented materials  labor and production overhead  million or represented inventory write downs  million or represented non cash charges related to equity issuances in manufacturing operations and million or represented software royalties 
for the year ended december   cost of goods sold was million  of which million or represented materials  labor and production overhead  million or represented warranty costs  million or represented non cash charges related to equity issuances in manufacturing operations and million or represented software royalties 
for the year ended december   there was no cost of goods sold 
gross profit for the years ended december  and  gross profit was million  or of revenue and million  or of revenue  respectively 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to contractors and outside service providers  and the costs of laboratory equipment and prototypes related to the design  development and testing of our products 
we have also incurred non cash charges related to equity issuances 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures  the timing of which can cause significant quarterly variability in our expenses 
the number of prototypes required to build and test a complex product such as the ip service delivery platform is large  and this building and testing process occurs over a short period of time 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease for the year ended december  was million or when compared with the year ended this decrease resulted from decreased non cash charges related to equity issuances 
the increase for the year ended december  was million or when compared with the year ended this increase resulted from increased non cash charges related to equity issuances  increased salary and related employee expenses  increased information technology and facilities costs and increased expenses for the development of prototypes of our ip service delivery platform 
non cash charges related to equity issuances were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales  marketing and customer evaluations  as well as the costs associated with customer evaluations and trials and other promotional and marketing expenses 
we devote substantial sales and marketing resources to customer evaluations and trials 
the complexity of our ip service delivery platform and the networks in which it is installed and integrated may often require extensive evaluation periods and trials 
these trials are conducted by our customers at customer designated locations or within our sales laboratories and require support from our highly trained systems engineers and service and support personnel 
these evaluations and trials generally take approximately three to months 
we anticipate that customer evaluations and trials will continue to require a substantial amount of our sales and marketing resources 
we have also incurred non cash charges related to equity issuances 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in sales and marketing expense was million or for the year ended december  when compared with the same period of this increase resulted from increased salary and related employee expenses  facilities costs  depreciation and marketing programs offset by a decrease in non cash charges related to equity issuances 
the increase in sales and marketing expense was million or for the year ended december  when compared with this increase resulted from increased salary and related employee expenses  increased non cash charges related to equity issuances  increased expenses associated with lending products to customers and establishing and maintaining sales laboratories for evaluation purposes  increased travel related expenses and increased facilities costs

restructuring charges in april and september of our senior management approved restructuring plans to reduce our worldwide workforce  close certain sales offices  exit certain facilities and idle certain property and equipment 
employees affected by the april plan were notified and terminated in april with respect to the september plan  notification was given to employees on september  that certain job functions would be eliminated and that particular termination benefits would be paid to affected employees 
the restructuring programs were implemented to reduce operating expenses and conserve cash 
details of the restructuring charges for the year ended december  are as follows in thousands non provision cash cash balance at charges payments charges year end worldwide workforce reduction   write down of property and equipment   lease commitments and other as a result of the workforce reductions  approximately employees were terminated in the second quarter  and approximately employees were designated for termination in the third quarter restructuring plan and were then terminated in the fourth quarter 
the employees in both workforce reductions were from all functional groups and were primarily located in our redwood city  california offices 
certain property and equipment has been written down to its expected realizable value 
future savings primarily due to workforce reductions are expected to amount to approximately million per quarter  starting in the first quarter of when compared to the second quarter of amounts related to the worldwide workforce reduction will be paid out through mid  and lease commitments will also be paid out over the respective lease terms through mid interest and other income expense for the year ended december   interest and other expense was million  an increase of million when compared with for the year ended december   interest and other income was million  an increase of million from the million for the increases reflect increased investment activity  which was the result of larger cash balances created from our september initial public offering and private financings in prior periods 
interest expense for the year ended december   interest expense was million  a decrease of million when compared with for the year ended december   interest expense was million  an increase of million when compared with the increase during reflects an increase in equipment loans and capital leases 
income tax provision provisions for income taxes of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  were comprised entirely of foreign corporate income taxes  which are a function of our international expansion and the establishment of subsidiaries in various countries 
the provision for income taxes is based on income taxes on minimum profits the foreign operations generated for services they provided to us 
our tax expense for fiscal will continue to depend on the amount and mix of income derived from sources subject to corporate income taxes of foreign taxing jurisdictions 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
we have not recognized any benefit from the future use of net operating loss carryforwards for these periods  or for any other periods  since our incorporation 
we are not recognizing the potential tax benefits of our net operating loss carryforwards because we do not have sufficient evidence that we will generate adequate profits to use them 
use of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
deemed dividend in march  we sold  shares of series d redeemable convertible preferred stock at per share for which we received proceeds of million 
at the date of issuance  we believed that the per share price of represented the fair value of the preferred stock 
after our initial public offering process began  we reevaluated and increased the fair value of our common stock at march the increase in fair value resulted in a beneficial conversion feature of million  which we recorded as a deemed dividend to preferred stockholders in we recorded the deemed dividend at the date of issuance by offsetting charges and credits to stockholders equity 
the preferred stock dividend increased the net loss allocable to common stockholders in the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per common share for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources prior to our initial public offering in september  we financed our operations primarily through sales of convertible preferred stock for net proceeds of million  plus equipment and working capital loans and capital leases 
upon the closing of our initial public offering on september   we received cash proceeds  net of underwriters discount and offering expenses  totaling million  and all of our convertible preferred stock was converted into million shares of common stock 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million 
this compares with million at december  operating activities we used million in cash for operations for the year ended december   an increase of million from the amount used in we used million in cash for operations for the year ended december   an increase of million from the use of cash in and was primarily the result of operating expenses due to salary and related employee expenses  and costs of information technology  facilities  product development  marketing and professional services related to the expansion of our business 
these operating expenses and associated use of cash were partially offset by revenue and gross profits  which generated cash 
investing activities for the year ended december   we provided million in cash for investing activities  an increase of million over the increase in cash provided primarily represents sales and maturities of short term investments 
for the year ended december   we used million in cash for investing activities  an increase of million from the increased use of cash reflects million for net purchases of short term investments and an increase of million in capital expenditures 
financing activities for the year ended december   we used million in cash from financing activities  a decrease of million from the decrease in cash used primarily reflects decreased proceeds from issuance of common stock 
for the year ended december   we received million in cash from financing activities  an increase of million from the majority of the increase in cash provided resulted from net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock in our initial public offering in september contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands due in due in due in due contractual obligation total and and thereafter equipment and working capital loans    capital lease obligations    operating lease obligations      raw material components   accrued severance related restructuring charges total      approximately  of the operating lease payments due in were accrued as part of our restructuring program recorded in september we believe that we possess sufficient liquidity and capital resources to fund our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next months 
we may require additional funds to support other purposes and may seek to raise these additional funds through debt or equity financing or from other sources 
there can be no assurances that additional funding will be available at all  or that if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us 
outlook we believe that capital spending in the telecommunications industry will recover in the long term two to five years 
however  due to reductions in capital spending plans by our customers and uncertainty within the telecommunications industry  the current and short term outlook up to two years for growth is not favorable 
the lack of capital availability for many emerging service providers combined with the emphasis of larger service providers on reducing operating expenses  has caused a significant reduction in capital spending in the industry as a whole 
while we believe this is a short term up to two years phenomenon  it has had and will continue to have a direct impact on our operations for at least the next fiscal year 
we anticipate that these capital spending trends will continue to adversely affect our revenue growth substantially for at least the next fiscal year 
as capital continues to be scarce  we believe that pricing will continue to be under pressure as each potential customer attempts to improve returns on invested capital 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 business combinations  sfas which requires all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
sfas is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  and all business combinations accounted for using the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is july   or later 
adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas which addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets but not those acquired in a business combination should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas which requires an impairment loss be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than the asset s carrying amount 
impairment  if any  is assessed using discounted cash flows 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt sfas in the first quarter of  effective january  adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
risk factors the following discussion describes certain risk factors related to our business as well as to our industry in general 
we have a history of losses that we expect will continue  and if we never achieve profitability we may cease operations 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have incurred net losses since our incorporation 
we cannot be certain that our revenue will grow or that we will generate sufficient revenue to become profitable 
if we do not achieve profitability  we may cease operations 
due to our loss making activity we could lose major opportunities with large service providers who are concerned with our long term financial viability 
many large telecommunications service providers purchase capital equipment from vendors with a history of successful operations including positive cash flow 
our history of losses and use of cash in operations may cause certain service providers to decide not to purchase our equipment because of concerns regarding our long term financial viability and our ability to support their businesses 
unless we can generate positive cash flows by either increasing revenues and or decreasing costs  concerns regarding our long term financial viability may cause some potential customers to purchase product from other larger  more established suppliers including cisco systems  lucent technologies  and nortel networks 
the outlook for capital spending in the telecommunications industry directly impacts our business 
due to reductions in capital spending plans by our customers and uncertainty within the telecommunications industry  the current and short term outlook up to two years for growth is not favorable 
capital spending in the industry as a whole has slowed as a result of a lack of available capital for many emerging service providers and a generally cautious approach to capital spending within the industry 
while we believe this is a current and short term up to two years phenomenon  we anticipate that these capital spending trends will continue to adversely affect our revenue growth substantially for at least the next fiscal year 
we participate in a competitive marketplace  and our failure to compete successfully would limit our ability to increase our market share and harm our business 
competition in the network infrastructure market is intense  and we expect that competition in the market for ip networking services will also be intense 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our revenue and market share will be negatively affected 
we face competition from companies in the network infrastructure market  including cisco systems  lucent technologies  nortel networks  alcatel  ericsson and siemens  and companies  including cisco  that market products for installation on the premises of network service providers customers that offer some services that compete with the services delivered using our ip service delivery platform 
we believe that there is likely to be consolidation in this industry 
we expect to face increased competition from larger companies with significantly greater resources than we have 
some of these larger competitors have pre existing relationships involving a range of product lines with the network service providers who are the principal potential customers for our ip service delivery platform 
these competitors may offer vendor financing  which we generally do not offer  undercut our prices or use their pre existing relationships with our customers to induce them not to use our ip service delivery platform 
the limited sales history of our ip service delivery platform makes forecasting our revenue difficult  which may impair our ability to manage our business 
we were founded in april  shipped our first test ip service delivery platform product in march  and sold our first ip service delivery platform product in march we have limited meaningful historical financial data upon which to forecast our revenue 
if our customers are unable to generate sales of services delivered using our products and to manage delivery of these services to their customers  we may be unable to sell our products 
our future success depends on network service providers  who are our customers  generating revenue from the sale of services delivered using our products 
sales of our products may decline or be delayed if our customers do not successfully introduce commercial services derived from our ip service delivery platform or if our customers do not generate revenue from these services sufficient to realize an attractive return on their investment in our ip service delivery platform 
our ability to generate future revenue also depends on whether network service providers successfully forecast market trends and identify the services and features that our products should offer their customers 
if our ip service delivery platform does not rapidly achieve market acceptance  we may be unable to achieve profitability 
our products offer a new approach for delivering services by network service providers  who may perceive our products as being more expensive than the other technologies and products they purchase 
if network service providers do not accept our ip service delivery platform as a method for delivering services to their customers  our ability to increase our revenue  achieve profitability and continue operations would be harmed 
our success also depends on third party software providers recognizing the advantages of our service delivery method and on our ability to effectively support their software development efforts 
our ip service delivery platform is our only product line  and our future revenue depends on its commercial success 
our ip service delivery platform  which is comprised of hardware and software elements  is the only product that we currently offer to our customers 
our future revenue depends on the commercial success of our ip service delivery platform product line 
if customers do not adopt  purchase and successfully implement our ip service delivery platform in large numbers  our revenue will not grow 
our products are technically complex and may contain errors or defects that are not found until our customers put our products to full use 
errors or defects in our products could seriously harm our reputation and our ability to sell our products 
our products are more complicated than most networking products 
they can be adequately tested only when put to full use in large and diverse networks with high amounts of traffic 
errors or defects in our products could result in loss of current customers and failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  and increased service and warranty costs 
the long sales cycle for our platform may cause our revenue and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter  and the price of our stock to decline 
a customer s decision to purchase our ip service delivery platform involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation  testing and product qualification process 
network service providers and other customers with complex networks usually expand their networks in increments on a periodic basis 
we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular and unpredictable basis 
these events may cause our revenue and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter  which could cause our stock price to decline 
if we fail to develop new products or features  we will have difficulty attracting customers 
based on our prior experience  we expect that our customers will require product features that our current ip service delivery platform does not have 
our products are technically complex  and the development of new products or features is an uncertain  time consuming and labor intensive process 
we may experience design  manufacturing or marketing problems with new products 
if we fail to develop new or enhanced products that meet customer requirements  our ability to attract and retain customers will be hindered 
if we fail to execute new product introductions in a timely manner we may experience erratic revenue growth  which could negatively affect profitability and in turn have a negative impact on our stock price 
in addition  such a failure could result in additional costs such as excess inventory  customer conversion costs  higher than expected product costs and higher than expected operating expenses in research and development and in sales and marketing 
we rely upon a limited number of customers  and any decrease in revenue from these customers or failure to increase our customer base could harm our operating results 
the loss of one or more of our customers  a reduction in purchases of our products by our customers or the decline of our customers business may limit our revenue growth and harm our operating results 
our customers may generally reduce or discontinue purchases of our products at any time 
our future success will depend on attracting additional customers 
failure to increase our customer base would hinder our growth and harm our operating results 
if we do not effectively manage our growth  our operations will suffer 
the growth of our operations places a significant strain on our management systems and resources 
if we do not effectively manage our growth and improve our managerial controls and systems  we may be unable to provide adequate service and support to our customers and our operations will suffer 
if we fail to retain key personnel our operation could suffer and our stock price may be negatively impacted 
maintaining key personnel may be difficult for a number of reasons including but not limited to market demand  stock price  growth opportunities  management philosophy  company performance and competitive activity 
if we lose key personnel we may find it difficult and costly to recruit new management and other personnel and this may have a negative affect on our company performance and in turn on our stock price 
a failure of our contract manufacturers or our sole source and limited source suppliers to meet our needs would seriously harm our ability to timely fill customer orders 
if any of our manufacturers terminates its relationship with us or is unable to produce sufficient quantities of our products in a timely manner and at satisfactory quality levels  our ability to fill customer orders on time  our reputation and our operating results will suffer 
our contract manufacturers do not have a long term obligation to supply products to us 
qualifying new contract manufacturers and starting volume production is expensive and time consuming and would disrupt our business 
we purchase several key components  including field programmable gate arrays  some integrated circuits and memory devices  and power supplies from a single source or a limited number of sources 
we do not have long term supply contracts for these components 
if our supply of these components is interrupted  we may be unable to locate an alternate source in a timely manner or at favorable prices 
interruption or delay in the supply of these components could cause us to lose sales to existing and potential customers 
if any of our significant suppliers were to terminate their relationships with us or compete against us  our revenue and market share will likely be reduced 
many of our suppliers also have significant development and marketing relationships with our competitors and have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
if they develop and market products in the future in competition with us  or form or strengthen arrangements with our competitors  our revenue and market share will likely be reduced 
if we fail to predict our manufacturing requirements accurately  we could incur additional costs or manufacturing delays 
we provide forecasts of our demand to our contract manufacturers up to twelve months before scheduled delivery of products to our customers 
if we overestimate our manufacturing requirements  we or our contract manufacturers may have excess or obsolete inventory  which could harm our operating results 
if we underestimate our requirements  our contract manufacturers may have an insufficient inventory  which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and revenue 
if we do not accurately anticipate lead times for components  we may experience component shortages 
if necessary licenses of third party technology are terminated or become unavailable or too expensive  our competitive position and our product offering will suffer 
we license from third party suppliers several key software applications incorporated in our ip service delivery platform 
also  we may need to license technology from other third party suppliers to enable us to develop new products or features 
our inability to renew or obtain any third party license that we need could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or at greater cost 
either of these outcomes could seriously impair our ability to sell our products and could harm our operating results 
insiders continue to have substantial control over us and they could delay or prevent a change in our corporate control even if our other stockholders wanted it to occur 
our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders who hold or more of the outstanding common stock and their affiliates beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders will be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this could delay or prevent an outside party from acquiring or merging with us even if our other stockholders wanted it to occur 
if we become subject to unfair hiring claims  we could be prevented from hiring needed personnel  or from pursuing or implementing our research  and could incur substantial liabilities or costs 
companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets 
we have been threatened with claims like these in the past and may receive claims of this kind in the future 
these claims could prevent us from hiring personnel or from using the intellectual property alleged to be trade secrets brought to us by the personnel who we hired 
we could also incur substantial costs and damages in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims  regardless of their merits 
defending ourselves against such claims could divert the attention of our management away from our operations 
if our products do not work the way our customers expect  orders for our products may be cancelled and the market perception of our products could be harmed 
if our products do not work with our customers or their end users networks  the market perception of our products could be harmed and orders for our products could be cancelled 
in particular  if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in a customer s or its end user s network that uses our products  we may be subject to lawsuits for losses suffered by customers or their end users 
if we have to redesign or modify our products to make them compatible with a customer s or end user s network  our sales cycle could be extended  our research and development costs may increase and profit margins on our products may decline 
because the markets in which we compete are prone to rapid technological change and the adoption of standards different from those that we use  our products could become obsolete  and we could be required to incur substantial costs to modify our products to remain competitive 
the market for our ip service delivery platform is prone to rapid technological change  the adoption of new standards  frequent new product introductions and changes in customer and end user requirements 
we may be unable to respond quickly or effectively to these developments 
we may experience difficulties that could prevent our development of new products and features 
the introduction of new products or technologies by competitors  or the emergence of new industry standards  could render our products obsolete or could require us to incur costs to redesign our products 
we rely on our intellectual property rights to be competitive  and if we are unable to protect these rights  we may never become profitable 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark  patent and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our ability to supply our products as they have been designed could suffer  and our ability to become profitable could be harmed 
if we become involved in an intellectual property dispute  we could be subject to significant liability  the time and attention of our management could be diverted and we could be prevented from selling our products 
we may become a party to litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or because others may allege infringement of their intellectual property 
these claims and any resulting lawsuit could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidate our proprietary rights 
these lawsuits  regardless of their merits  likely would be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation alleging our infringement of a third party s intellectual property also could force us to stop selling products or services that use the challenged intellectual property  obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  and redesign those products or services that use the infringed technology 
if our stock price falls below  we could be delisted from the nasdaq 
our stock price was below during a portion of if the stock price does not remain over within the time frame specified by nasdaq listing rules  our stock may be delisted 
we believe that delisting our stock would have negative effects on liquidity and on the value of the stock 
although the nasdaq has temporarily suspended the listing rule  it may be reinstated at the nasdaq discretion 
acts of war  terrorist activity  and bio terrorism can have a negative effect on the demand for our products 
the terrorist activity on september  and the ensuing declaration of war on terrorism may result in reduced demand for networking products 
capital spending in the telecommunications industry was already depressed prior to the tragedy  and additional news regarding war and terrorism may negatively impact the demand for our products 
these circumstances may result in delayed purchases  cancelled orders and new technology requirements  which could lead to reduced revenues or increased costs  which in turn could negatively affect our stock price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we do not currently use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading or hedging purposes 
in addition  we maintain our cash equivalents in government and agency securities  debt instruments of financial institutions and corporations and money market funds 
our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates relates primarily to corporate debt securities 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of the credit exposure to any one issuer 
our general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
all highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents  and all investments with maturities of three months or greater are classified as available for sale and considered to be short term investments 
exchange rate sensitivity currently  all of our sales and most of our expenses are denominated in united states dollars 
therefore  we have not engaged in any foreign exchange hedging activities to date 
however  we expect to conduct transactions in foreign currencies in increasing volumes in the future  and as a result we may engage in foreign exchange hedging activities
