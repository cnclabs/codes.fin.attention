item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition as of december  and results of operations for the years ended december   and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements and selected financial data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
for a more detailed discussion of forward looking statements and the potential risks and uncertainties that may impact upon their accuracy  see the forward looking statements section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and also the potential risks and uncertainties set forth in the overview section hereof and in the risk factors section included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligations to update any forward looking statements 
you should also carefully consider the factors set forth in other reports or documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
overview we are engaged in the development and commercialization of genetic diversity technologies  products and services 
since we began operations in march  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development and application of a portfolio of products and services using our proprietary biochemistry for scoring single nucleotide polymorphisms  or snps  as well as microfluidics technologies for applications  principally in the field of high volume snp scoring and pharmacogenetics analysis 
in  our business focused on our snp scoring products and services that apply our proprietary snp it primer extension technology  and on our identity genomics services in paternity and forensics 
during  we entered into various agreements 
these agreements had varying terms and included but were not limited to i services agreements whereby we agreed to provide genetic analysis services  ii services agreements under which we would provide genotyping services  iii license agreements pursuant to which we granted third parties royalty bearing  non exclusive and exclusive licenses to use our snp it single base primer extension technology to produce and sell reagent kits and software incorporating our technology  and iv agreements under which we agreed to provide snpstream instruments and snpware consumables 
we have recognized revenue associated with these agreements 
we are entitled to receive royalties on product sales  if any  for the duration of any of our license agreements  subject to certain creditable up front payments we have received 
since late  following our acquisition of genescreen and  our subsequent acquisitions of cellmark and lifecodes  in  we also have been a leading provider of dna testing services in the paternity  forensics and hla transplantation typing fields 
our ability to achieve profitability will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to develop and commercialize our proprietary snp scoring technologies in the form of products and services for pharmaceutical  biotechnology and diagnostic companies and research institutions  as well as our ability to competitively bid on  and receive contracts  for identity genomics testing services 
we introduced our snpstream k snp scoring system  snpware consumables and related services in late in september  we introduced the snpstream mt solution with medium throughput capabilities and based on the luminex xmap platform 
because our proprietary snp it primer extension technology is very adaptable to other hardware platforms  we intend to expand our offerings of snpware consumables for use on instruments made or sold by other companies and to obtain license fees and royalties by licensing our snp it technology for incorporation in the consumable kits of others 
our collaborations with affymetrix  amersham biosciences  applied biosystems and perkinelmer are examples of this platform propagation strategy 
we also provide snp it based high quality snp scoring to a variety of customers on a fee for service basis 
our megasnpatron facility currently offers high throughput snp genotyping services to such customers as astrazeneca  ellipsis  glaxosmithkline  lilly  oklahoma medical research foundation  pig improvement corporation on three different platforms  the snpstream k system  the snpstream mt  and snpcode 
we intend to add our ultra high throughput snpstream uht system to our megasnpatron facility in early  giving us the broadest range of snp scoring options available to service customers in the industry 
we believe fee for service snp scoring will be an attractive option for many customers 
acquisitions on december   we acquired genescreen  inc genescreen  as a wholly owned subsidiary  which operates genetic diversity testing laboratories in dallas  texas and dayton  ohio 
genescreen performs dna laboratory analyses for paternity  transplantation and forensic testing 
genescreen s primary source of revenue is paternity testing under contracts with various state and county government agencies 
on february   we acquired cellmark diagnostics  a division of astrazeneca  in an asset acquisition  for a combination of cash and  shares of our common stock 
cellmark is a leading provider of genetic testing services in the uk and sells kits and conducts testing for genetic diseases  including cystic fibrosis 
we agreed to prepare and file a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission to register for resale the  shares of common stock issued to astrazeneca in partial consideration for our purchase of the assets of cellmark 
the shares issued to astrazeneca as part of the purchase were registered with the securities and exchange commission on may   which registration became effective on may on december   we acquired all of the outstanding equity securities of lifecodes corporation  in a tax free transaction 
lifecodes  now a wholly owned subsidiary of orchid  is a leading provider of genomics testing for forensics and paternity in the us 
we acquired lifecodes in order to strengthen our position in the clinical testing market 
lifecodes also maintains a diagnostic kit business which adds to our current products 
we view this acquisition  in addition to the two previous acquisitions of genescreen and cellmark  as a significant step in providing a cost efficient  high throughput clinical testing business 
in exchange for lifecodes shares we agreed to issue  shares of our common stock to former stockholders of lifecodes   shares which were deposited in an escrow account and may be used to compensate us in the event that we are entitled to indemnification under the amended and restated agreement and plan of merger 
we also issued  and  fully vested options and warrants  respectively  which are exercisable for our common stock in exchange for existing lifecodes options and warrants 
the acquisition has been accounted for by the purchase method  and accordingly  the assets and liabilities acquired have been recorded at their fair values 
the total consideration as a result of this acquisition is approximately million 
genescreen s  cellmark s  and lifecodes businesses in paternity and forensics testing supports our goal of extending our business in genetic diversity 
we intend to apply our ultra high throughput snp scoring technology to the paternity and forensics businesses of genescreen  cellmark  and lifecodes in order to significantly reduce the cost of providing these identity genomics services 
we also plan to use the accredited laboratories at genescreen  cellmark  and lifecodes to offer clinical quality pharmacogenetic snp scoring of patient samples for clinical association studies and pharmaceutical clinical trials 
we also plan to use these laboratories to conduct pharmacogenetic snp scoring services that we offer to physicians and patients in the future through a number of distribution channels  including the internet 
our dna testing business is dependent upon our ability to successfully and competitively bid and qualify for contracts with various governmental entities to provide paternity and forensics testing services 
we expect revenues from the respective forensics businesses of genescreen  cellmark  and lifecodes to increase as dna analyses are increasingly being used by the authorities within the criminal justice system to identify perpetrators and exonerate the innocent 
our geneshield business  established in  is working to implement a strategy based on the creation of proprietary rights covering the identification of snps and their associations to medically important attributes of patients 
geneshield is also developing a number of innovative programs designed to accelerate the adoption of pharmacogenetics into routine health care 
these programs are focused on health outcomes and may include a number of health system participants  including providers  patients and payers 
geneshield expects to announce its first beta test program in the last quarter of we are developing intellectual property rights in this area through collaborations with members of our clinical genetics network  and we intend also to develop intellectual property rights to medical and diagnostic uses of snps through our collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
we expect geneshield to commence generating revenues in compensation charges in prior years  we recorded deferred compensation resulting from the granting of stock options to employees  directors or consultants with exercise prices below the fair market value of the underlying common stock at the date of their grant 
during  all stock options were granted with grant prices equal to the fair value of our common stock at the grant date 
net of prior amortization  and remeasurement related to options previously granted to consultants  deferred compensation of approximately million at december  will be amortized over the vesting periods of the respective options  typically four years 
we anticipate recording total compensation charges resulting from the amortization in future periods of the deferred compensation as of december  as follows in millions year ended december  the portion of these amounts which results from grants to consultants is subject to remeasurement at the end of each reporting period based upon the changes in the fair value of our common stock until the consultant completes performance under his or her respective option agreement 
a reduction of deferred compensation of approximately million was recorded in related to such remeasurements 
also  certain grants of performance based options have been made for which no deferred compensation expense has been recorded and for which compensation expense will be measured at the time the performance criteria is met as the difference between the fair value of the common stock and the exercise price and will be immediately recorded as compensation expense 
we have incurred losses since inception  and  as of december   we had total stockholders equity of approximately million  including an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we anticipate incurring additional losses over at least the next several years 
we expect these losses to continue as we expand the commercialization of our products and services and we fully implement our proprietary geneshield business 
we expect this expansion to result in some increases in research and development  marketing and sales  and general and administrative expenses 
payments under strategic alliances  collaborations and licensing arrangements will be subject to significant fluctuation in both timing and amount and therefore our results of operations for any period may not be comparable to the results of operations for any other period 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows 
revenue recognition 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
sources of revenues and revenue recognition 
we have had  and expect in the future to have  several sources of revenues 
prior to our acquisitions of genescreen  cellmark  and lifecodes  we derived substantially all of our revenues from research and development collaborations  technology grants and awards from several governmental agencies 
in  we derived our first revenues from the sale of testing kits and laboratory dna testing services from our cellmark division in the uk 
in  we derived our first revenues from the performance of laboratory dna testing services by genescreen  our wholly owned subsidiary in the us 
in  we derived our first revenues from the placement of our first commercial snpstream hardware system  and throughout and  we derived increased amounts of revenues from the sale of snp it based consumables 
we also derived significant license revenue beginning in our services segment also includes snp scoring analyses revenue 
in connection with the research and development collaborations that provided the majority of our revenues in the early years of our corporate history  we recognize revenues when related research expenses are incurred and when we satisfy specific performance obligations under the terms of the respective research contracts 
we defer up front licensing fees obtained in connection with such agreements and amortize them over the estimated performance period of the respective research contract 
we recognize milestone payments as revenues upon the completion of the milestone event or requirement  if it represents the achievement of a significant step in research and development or performance process 
we recognize dna laboratory and snp scoring service revenues on a completed contract basis at the time test results are completed and reported 
deferred revenues represent the unearned portion of payments received in advance of tests being completed and reported 
to date  we have offered our snpstream system hardware in two basic types of transactions  either a purchase and sale transaction or an arrangement in which the customer takes possession of the system and pays an access fee for its use 
we record revenues on the sale of the hardware upon transfer of title and after we have met all of our significant performance obligations 
we defer access fee payments that we receive when a system is initially placed with a customer  and recognize revenues on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
revenues from the sale of consumables are recognized upon the transfer of title  generally when our products are shipped to our customers from our facilities 
revenues from license arrangements  including license fees creditable against potential future royalty obligations of the licensee  are recognized when an arrangement is entered into if we have no significant continuing involvement under the terms of the arrangement 
if we have significant continuing involvement under such an arrangement  license fees are deferred and recognized over the estimated performance period 
management has made estimates and assumptions relating to the performance period which are subject to change 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the amount of revenues from licenses reported in any given period 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following 
significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  
significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  
significant negative industry or economic trends  and 
significant decrease in market value of assets 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill  and enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to million as of december  in  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and  as a result  we will cease to amortize approximately million of net goodwill recorded as of december  we had recorded approximately million of amortization during in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and also an annual impairment review in and thereafter 
we currently do not expect to record an impairment upon completion of the initial impairment review 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment will not be recorded 
certain events or market and business conditions in the future could cause us to revise our estimates and judgments  and could result in a material impairment of property and equipment and other intangible assets 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
revenues for of approximately million represent an increase of approximately million as compared to revenues of approximately million for this increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in clinical laboratory testing revenue  of which million relates to our two acquisitions in  cellmark and lifecodes  an increase in revenues derived from our genescreen operations  as well as genotyping services performed under genotyping service arrangements entered into during product revenues also increased by approximately million during  of which million relates to our two acquisitions in  cellmark and lifecodes  the placement of snpstream systems  as well as an increase in related consumable sales 
the company also recognized approximately million in collaboration revenue during which is primarily related to the successful completion of the first milestone under our genotyping agreement with astrazeneca whereby we recognized 
million 
we have also recognized license revenue of approximately million for versus million in  which is primarily composed of royalty bearing  non exclusive and exclusive licenses to use our snp it technology 
cost of product revenues and access fees 
cost of product revenues and access fees for was approximately million  or of product revenues and access fees  compared to approximately  or of product revenues and access fees  for the increase in cost of product revenues and access fees as a percent of product revenue is attributable to an increased number of snpstream k placements in which had a lower gross margin 
the increase in cost of product revenue was attributable to the costs associated with the snpstream instrument placements  and to consumables sold during  including an increase of million related to our acquisition of cellmark on february  and lifecodes on december  cost of clinical laboratory testing 
cost of clinical laboratory testing was approximately million  or of clinical laboratory testing revenue for  compared to approximately million  or  for the increase was attributable to costs associated with our cellmark division of approximately million  which we acquired on february   and costs associated with lifecodes of approximately million  which we acquired on december  the decrease in cost of clinical laboratory testing as a percent of clinical laboratory testing revenues is attributed to our cellmark division  which generates a higher gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and other administrative personnel  recruiting expenses  professional fees  legal expenses resulting from intellectual property prosecution and protection  and other corporate expenses including business development and general legal activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were approximately million  an increase of approximately million  as compared to approximately million for we attribute this increase primarily to the expansion of administration facilities and the hiring of additional personnel as we increased our executive and administrative staffing in anticipation of our growth 
during  there was an increase in our depreciation expense of approximately million  due to capital expenditures made in for computers  furniture and fixtures  and leasehold improvements associated with our facilities expansion 
we also incurred additional salaries and related expenses of approximately million  as well as an increase in selling  general and marketing expenses of approximately million relating to our cellmark division and million relating to lifecodes 
these various increases in general and administrative expenses were offset by a decrease in amortziation of deferred compensation in of approximately million 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  material costs for prototypes and test units  and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
research and development expenses for were approximately million  compared to approximately million for the increase in research and development expenses of approximately million for includes the netting effect of a prior year transaction with sarnoff corporation whereby we recorded an approximate million charge related to approximately a million cash payment made to and the fair value of  shares of common stock and five year warrants to purchase  shares of common stock issued to sarnoff corporation as an advance on the issuances that would have been owed in december under a license and option agreement  and an amendment to that agreement 
as the licensed technology under this agreement had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses  the million was charged to research and development 
excluding this transaction  research and development expense in increased by approximately million 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased expenses as we hired additional research and development personnel of approximately million  increased purchases of material and laboratory supplies of approximately million  and increased research and development expenses related to our genescreen  cellmark  and lifecodes facilities of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
this increase was also attributable to increased facilities expenses in connection with the expansion of our internal and collaborative research efforts  including our collaboration with the snp consortium  of approximately million 
these various increases were offset by a decrease in amortization of deferred compensation during of approximately million 
we expect future research and development expenses to decrease as our products shift from the research and development stage to commercialization 
impairment of assets 
during  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million to write down goodwill which was recorded when we acquired genescreen on december  subsequent to september   we announced our intention to acquire lifecodes as discussed above 
lifecodes operates primarily in the same industry and provides the same services as genescreen 
based primarily on the acquisition price for lifecodes  among other matters  we determined that a triggering event occurred for which an impairment review would be required pursuant to sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
the impairment charge was recorded based on the fair value of genescreen as computed using a discounted cash flow valuation model 
this charge reduced the unamortized goodwill recorded in the acquisition of genescreen to zero 
this charge relates to the services segment of our business 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge related to certain equipment 
we utilize this equipment primarily to perform research and development activities and  to a limited extent  genotyping services for customers 
during the first half of  we expect to launch the second generation of this equipment 
the second generation provides higher throughput and is more cost effective 
we expect to use this next generation equipment to replace the first generation equipment over time and to provide the same services and functions that the first generation equipment provided 
we performed an analysis of our future needs relating to this equipment and determined its fair value 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million  which represents the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment exceeded the related fair value 
interest income 
interest income for of approximately million decreased approximately million from approximately million for this decrease was primarily due to interest received on larger cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances which we held during  offset by amounts used to fund operating activities 
this decrease is also attributable to lower interest rates during compared to interest expense 
interest expense for was approximately million compared to approximately million for this increase was due to borrowings made during late and in may and december on our equipment loan line 
net loss allocable to common stockholders 
due to the factors discussed above  for  we reported a net loss allocable to common stockholders of approximately million as compared to approximately million for net loss allocable to common stockholders for includes a beneficial conversion feature on preferred stock of approximately million 
years ended december  and revenues 
revenues for of approximately million represent an increase of approximately million as compared to revenues of approximately million for the increase was largely due to revenues generated from our genescreen dna testing operations of approximately million  revenues generated from access fees related to the placements of our snpstream k instrument systems and sales of consumables of approximately million  license revenues from several agreements to license our snp it technology of approximately million and grant revenues of approximately million for the results of operations for do not include those of genescreen  which we acquired on december  genescreen s revenues for were approximately million compared to approximately million for the same period in the approximately million decrease in revenue from to was caused by the loss of one contract 
cost of product revenues and access fees 
cost of product revenues and access fees for were approximately million  compared to approximately for the increase was attributable to the costs associated with the snpstream instrument placements  primarily depreciation and consumables sold 
cost of clinical laboratory testing 
cost of clinical laboratory testing was approximately million for the increase was attributable to the acquisition of genescreen on december   which provides of our clinical laboratory testing 
there was no cost of clinical laboratory testing for due to the fact that we had not yet acquired genescreen at that time 
cost of clinical laboratory testing of genescreen for was approximately million  or of revenues compared to the cost of clinical laboratory testing for of approximately million  or of revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and other administrative personnel  recruiting expenses  professional fees  legal expenses resulting from intellectual property prosecution and protection  and other corporate expenses including business development and general legal activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were approximately million  an increase of approximately million  as compared to approximately million for we attribute this increase primarily to the expansion of administration facilities and the hiring of additional personnel as we increased our executive and administrative staffing in anticipation of and after becoming a public company and supporting our future growth  amortization of deferred compensation expense of approximately million and operating costs of approximately million related to genescreen  of which approximately million represents amortization of intangibles related to that acquisition  and professional fees of approximately million 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  material costs for prototypes and test units  and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
research and development expenses for were approximately million  compared to approximately million for the increase in research and development expenses of approximately million for was primarily attributable to increased expenses as we hired additional research and development personnel  increased purchases of laboratory supplies  increased equipment depreciation  amortization of deferred compensation expense of approximately million  increased facilities expenses in connection with the expansion of our internal and collaborative research efforts  an aggregate of approximately million comprised of an approximate million cash payment made to and the fair value of  shares of common stock and  warrants to purchase common stock issued to sarnoff as an advance on the issuances that we would have owed to sarnoff in december under a license and option agreement  and an amendment to that agreement 
as the technology licensed under this agreement had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses  the million was charged to research and development in interest income 
interest income for of approximately million increased approximately million from approximately million for this increase was primarily due to interest received on larger cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances which we held as a result of our receipt of proceeds from our series e private placement in december and january and our initial public offering in may  offset by amounts used to fund operating activities 
interest expense 
interest expense for was approximately million compared to approximately million for this was due to greater outstanding debt balance related to the bridge financing completed in june  which converted to series e mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock in december  and interest attributable to warrants issued in connection with the bridge financing  as compared to the lower outstanding debt balance in  comprised entirely of borrowings on our equipment loan line 
net loss allocable to common stockholders 
due to the factors discussed above  we reported a net loss allocable to common stockholders of approximately million for as compared to approximately million for net loss allocable to common stockholders for and includes a beneficial conversion feature on preferred stock of approximately million and approximately million  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through research and development funding from collaborative partners  from our two private placements of equity securities with aggregated net proceeds of approximately million that closed in march and in december and january  million from our initial public offering which closed in may  and approximately million from our follow on offering of common stock in june our sale of series e mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock in december resulted in an approximate million beneficial conversion feature which was included in net loss allocable to common stockholders in the closing of our sale of series e mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock in january resulted in an approximate additional million beneficial conversion feature which was included in net loss allocable to common stockholders in in december  we obtained a secured million equipment loan line  for the purchase of plant and equipment at our corporate headquarters and research and development laboratories whose availability expired in in december  this agreement was amended to establish a new borrowing base of an additional million 
at december   we had borrowings of approximately million outstanding  and approximately million available to be borrowed under this facility through we lease our corporate and primary research facility under operating leases  which expire in and  respectively 
if we do not maintain minimum unrestricted cash  as defined in the agreement  equal to the greater of million or twelve month s cash needs calculated by taking the trailing three months net cash used in operations multiplied by four  we are required to provide a cash security deposit or letter of credit equal to an amount defined in the agreement  not to exceed of outstanding amounts on draws made in or subsequent to december equal to approximately million at december  
in addition  as of december  and just prior to the follow on offering completed in march  we have not maintained the minimum unrestricted cash defined in the agreement 
we have received a waiver from our lender with respect to this financial covenant violation for this period 
on may   we filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission 
subject to our ongoing obligations under the securities act of  as amended  and the securities exchange act of  as amended  the registration statement permits us to offer and sell various types of securities  up to an aggregate value of approximately million  of which approximately million remains available for future use 
the sale of common stock in june for gross proceeds of approximately million was registered under this registration statement 
the subsequent sale of common stock in february and march for gross proceeds of approximately million was also registered under a prospectus supplement to this registration statement 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to approximately million as of december  this decrease is due to increased operating expenses related to the expansion of our genotyping and geneshield facilities  cash paid to acquire cellmark  lifecodes  and the affymetrix patent and license  and to fund our operations during  offset by net proceeds of approximately million received from our offering of common stock in june net cash used in operations for was approximately million compared with approximately million for non cash charges for included a goodwill and equipment impairment charge of approximately million  depreciation and amortization expense of approximately million and compensation expense of approximately million 
investing activities included capital expenditures of approximately million  approximately million in cash paid related to our acquisition of cellmark including acquisition costs  approximately million in cash paid related to our acquisition of lifecodes net of cash acquired and including acquisition costs paid  approximately million related to our acquisition of the patents and licenses  and approximately million of net proceeds from sales and maturities  net of purchases  of short term investments 
financing activities primarily consisted of approximately million of net proceeds from issuance of common stock  primarily our offering of common stock in june  and cash received from stock options and warrants exercised in working capital decreased to approximately million at december  from approximately million at december  this decrease is due to operating expenses related to the expansion of our genotyping and geneshield facilities  cash paid to acquire cellmark  lifecodes  and the affymetrix patent and license  and to fund operations of the company during  offset by net proceeds of approximately million received from our offering of common stock in june we believe that our cash reserves and expected short term revenue will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next months 
we may need to access the capital markets for additional financing to operate our ongoing business activities after that time 
we cannot assure you that our business or operations will not change in a manner that would consume available resources more rapidly than anticipated 
we also cannot assure you that we will not require substantial additional funding before we can achieve profitable operations 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including the following 
our ability to enter into strategic alliances or make acquisitions  
regulatory changes and competing technological and market developments  
changes in our existing collaborative relationships  
the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  
the development of our snpware consumables  snpstream and software product lines and associated reagent consumables  
our ability to successfully secure contracts for high volume genotyping services from pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural companies  
the success rate of establishing new contracts  and renewal rate of existing contracts  for identity genomics services in the areas of paternity  forensics and transplantation  
the progress of our existing and future milestone and royalty producing activities  and 
the availability of additional funding at favorable terms  if necessary 
as of december   our net operating loss carry forwards were approximately million and approximately million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
if not utilized  our federal and state tax loss carry forwards will begin to expire in and  respectively 
utilization of our net operating losses to offset future taxable income  if any  may be substantially limited due to change of ownership provisions in the internal revenue code of we have not yet determined the extent to which limitations were triggered as a result of past financings or may be triggered as a result of future financings 
this annual limitation is likely to result in the expiration of certain net operating losses prior to their use 
recent pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after june  sfas also specifies criteria intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
sfas will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas sfas will also require that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
we adopted the provisions of sfas immediately and are required to adopt sfas effective january  furthermore  goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june   but before sfas is adopted in full will not be amortized  but will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre sfas accounting literature 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  will continue to be amortized and tested for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre sfas accounting requirements prior to the adoption of sfas sfas will require upon adoption of sfas  that we evaluate our existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior purchase business combination  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in sfas for recognition apart from goodwill 
upon adoption of sfas  we will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  we will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with sfas s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the statement will require us to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  we must identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
we will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas  to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of operations 
as of the date of adoption  we have unamortized goodwill in the amount of approximately million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of approximately million  all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas and amortization expense related to goodwill was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas and  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these statements on our consolidated financial statements at the date of this report  including whether it will be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas requires the recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
a retirement obligation is defined as one in which a legal obligation exists in the future resulting from existing laws  statutes or contracts 
we are required to adopt sfas effective january  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes both sfas no 
 and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a business segment as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas retains the fundamental provisions in sfas no 
for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas no 
for example  sfas no 
provides guidance on how long lived assets that are used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
sfas no 
retains the basic provisions of apb no 
on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike sfas no 
 an impairment assessment under sfas no 
will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under sfas no 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
on january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
for assets held for use to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements because the impairment assessment under sfas no 
is largely unchanged from sfas no 
the provisions of the new standard for assets held for sale or disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities 
therefore  we cannot determine the potential effects that the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
will have on the consolidated financial statements
