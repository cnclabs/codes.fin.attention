item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating earnings and dividends earnings from operations  as defined below  were per share for the year ended december   an increase of  or  compared to per share for the year ended december  earnings from operations reflect the results for both utility and non regulated operating units and do not include non cash charges  discussed below  of per share for an extraordinary item recorded in the third quarter and per share recorded in the fourth quarter for an investment write down relating to the company s non utility energy technology investment 
diluted earnings per share after the investment write down and the extraordinary item were in unitil s annual common stock dividend in was per share 
this annual dividend resulted in a payout ratio of  for the year  before the investment write down and extraordinary item 
excluding the loss from non regulated operations  the payout ratio was based on earnings from utility operations  before the investment write down and extraordinary item 
at its january meeting  the unitil board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend on the company s common stock of per share 
this quarterly dividend reflects the current annual dividend rate of per share 
as shown in the following table  utility operations contributed per share to earnings from operations  compared to per share in the reduction in earnings from utility operations primarily reflects lower sales to industrial customers due to a slowing economy  warmer winter weather and lower electric rates for unitil s massachusetts based operating utility 
the company s non regulated energy brokerage business  usource  recorded a loss of per share in  an improvement of over the loss of recorded in the decreased loss from usource operations is related to increased brokerage fees and the company s refocused operating plan

as we complete the transition to a restructured utility environment in our massachusetts and new hampshire service territories  we are setting a course to achieve continued improvement in operating results for our utility operations business unit 
our non regulated business unit  usource  also has an opportunity for improved results as more regulatory jurisdictions throughout the nation are restructured and opened to customer choice

utility operations despite a slowing economy in  our electric energy sales to residential and commercial customers were up in all three of unitil s distribution utility service areas  compared to the prior year 
our new hampshire distribution operating companies experienced record high system peak electric loads during a sustained summer heat wave 
however  the national economic slowdown has directly impacted our industrial sales  as manufacturing utilization and output have been curtailed 
for  total electric kwh sales increased slightly by compared to residential electric sales increased  while commercial electric sales increased 
electric sales to industrial customers decreased in compared to gas sales were up through the first three quarters of the year  then dipped below prior year levels due to unseasonably mild temperatures in the fourth quarter of on a full year basis  gas sales were down compared to prior year 
total operating revenues in increased to million  or  over year operating revenues 
this increase primarily reflects a period of rising and highly volatile wholesale energy prices for electric and natural gas energy commodities  during and early  which resulted in increased gas and electric supply related revenues and costs 
energy related supply costs are reconciled and recovered in revenues through regulated cost recovery adjustment mechanisms with no markup or profit margin 
by mid  energy costs began to ease allowing the company to flow through those savings to customers 
unitil has implemented several gas and electric energy related rate decreases in the latter half of  principally due to the decline in these wholesale energy costs 
operating expenses excluding energy supply related costs increased in compared to  primarily reflecting higher system maintenance expenses  an increase in uncollectable account write offs and increases in depreciation and amortization on new plant additions and improvements  offset by lower franchise tax expense 
interest expense  net  was relatively unchanged in compared to a higher level of interest expense related to debt outstanding offset an increase in accrued interest income associated with deferred rate recovery mechanisms for restructuring related regulatory assets 
unitil s utility operating companies continued to develop and implement comprehensive gas and electric utility industry restructuring plans and strategies in the company s massachusetts combination gas and electric utility  fitchburg gas and electric light company fg e  received a series of state regulatory orders during october  which completed the review and disposition of a number of pending ratemaking and restructuring related issues 
as further discussed below see extraordinary item  these regulatory orders reflected a significant turning point in the company s regulated business environment and determined the treatment and recovery of restructuring related regulatory assets and costs in massachusetts 
one of the orders also completed an investigation into the overall earnings level of fg e s electric division 
as a result of this investigation  fg e was directed to reduce its base electric distribution rates prospectively by million annually  or approximately 
in compliance with this order  the company reduced its electric distribution rates  effective october  the company is now in the process of preparing performance based ratemaking pbr plans for fg e s gas and electric distribution divisions 
under pbr  a company s earnings are tied to performance targets and penalties can be imposed for deterioration of service quality 
the pbr plan will establish new distribution rates based on traditional cost of service ratemaking  service quality standards and penalties  and procedures for adjusting retail rates in future periods to reflect cost inflation and other factors over the term of the pbr plan 
during the first quarter of  fg e completed the restructuring related divestiture of its interest in millstone unit no 
nuclear generating station millstone 
this sale ended the company s involvement in nuclear power generation and eliminated all potential future liabilities related to this nuclear generating facility  including environmental and decommissioning liabilities 
during the year  unitil s new hampshire utility operating companies also completed the preparation of an electric restructuring plan and offer of settlement  which was filed in january for regulatory review and approval 
this filing will result in the divestiture of unitil s remaining regulated long term power supply portfolio  the combination of unitil s new hampshire utility operations into a single utility  the unbundling and setting of new separate rates for energy and delivery services  and the introduction of retail choice allowing customers to choose a competitive energy supplier or to continue to receive their energy supply from unitil during a transition period 
as a result of the progress unitil continues to make towards the restructuring of its massachusetts and new hampshire utility operations  the company expects all of its utility operating subsidiaries to be operating by the end of in a post restructuring environment that reflects the unbundling of energy and delivery services  the recovery of restructuring and transition related costs through appropriate rate mechanisms and newly established retail distribution rates 
the company is and will continue to be dedicated to the provision of the highest quality gas and electric distribution services to its customers at the lowest or among the lowest rates in the region 
the company launched its new  interactive customer web site in july all of our utility customers can now access their accounts and execute transactions including payment of bills over the internet at our web site  www

this is one of a series of steps to improve service and enhance efficiencies through web enabled systems reflecting the latest advances in technology 
usource energy brokering in the face of a market contraction of internet based business expansion opportunities aimed at mid market customers  the company quickly refocused its energy brokering business in the first half of toward our core customer base 
usource has succeeded in brokerage energy transactions for large and medium size customers and  in  the company targeted a deeper penetration of these customer segments and achieved good revenue growth 
usource was able to extend its reach in the northeast to include new and expanding markets in connecticut  maine  massachusetts and pennsylvania 
usource increased revenues to  in from  in and is prepared to target new customer segments as energy markets continue to deregulate  allowing more customers to choose their energy suppliers 
usource is a broker of electric and natural gas energy supply contracts and does not take title to the commodity being traded 
the company reorganized its usource operations in in order to control costs and improve financial performance 
the current revenue stream of usource covers the variable costs of operating this segment  which demonstrated marked improvement in earnings performance over usource serves its customer base by providing a wide range of energy brokering and related services 
one way that usource processes brokering transactions is through an internet based retail energy exchange operated by enermetrix  inc enermetrix  in which unitil is an investor 
the enermetrix exchange serves customers in several markets in the northeast 
during the fourth quarter  unitil recorded a non cash charge to earnings of million  net of tax see investment write down to recognize the decrease in market valuation of its investment in enermetrix 
usource will continue to optimize value for its customers by seeking the best terms available for the purchase of their energy needs 
as the volume of energy brokering grows further  usource will continue to use the enermetrix exchange and other available energy trading platforms to execute transactions 
extraordinary item in november  the massachusetts legislature enacted landmark electric industry restructuring legislation the restructuring act 
the restructuring act required all electric utilities to file a restructuring plan with the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy mdte by december  the filing of its restructuring plan the plan by unitil s massachusetts operating subsidiary  fg e marked an unprecedented turning point in fg e s year history 
among other things  the restructuring act required all massachusetts electric utilities to sell all of their electric generation assets and to restructure their utility operations to provide direct retail access to their customers by all qualified generation suppliers 
the mdte conditionally approved fg e s plan in february  and started an investigation and evidentiary hearings into fg e s proposed recovery of regulatory assets related to stranded generation asset costs and expenses related to the formulation and implementation of its plan 
in january  the mdte approved fg e s plan  which included provisions for the recovery of stranded costs through a transition charge in the company s electric rates 
in september  fg e filed its first annual reconciliation of stranded generation asset costs and expenses and associated transition charge revenues  and the mdte initiated a lengthy investigation and hearing process 
on october  and october   the mdte issued a series of regulatory orders in several pending cases involving fg e  including a final order on fg e s initial reconciliation filing 
those orders included the review and disposition of issues related to the company s recovery of transition costs due to the restructuring of the electric industry in massachusetts  as well as certain costs associated with gas industry restructuring and preparation and litigation of performance based rate proceedings initiated by the mdte 
the orders determined the final treatment of regulatory assets that fg e had sought to recover from its massachusetts electric customers over a multi year transition period that began in fg e has now determined that it is authorized to recover approximately million of regulatory assets attributable to stranded generation assets  purchased power costs and related expenses 
as a result of the industry restructuring related orders  fg e recorded a non cash adjustment to regulatory assets of million  which resulted in the recognition of an extraordinary charge of million  net of tax 
the company recognized the extraordinary charge of per share as of september  as a result of all of these orders  the company has been allowed recovery of its massachusetts industry restructuring transition costs  estimated at million  including the above market or stranded generation and power supply related costs  via a non bypassable uniform transition charge 
fg e has been and will continue to be subject to annual mdte investigation and review in order to reconcile the costs and revenues associated with the collection of transition charges from its customers over the next eight to ten years 
investment write down statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities addresses the accounting and reporting for investments in equity securities and requires companies to determine whether a decline in the fair value of the investment in equity securities is other than temporary 
the company had invested million in enermetrix  inc enermetrix  an energy technology start up enterprise  over the past several years 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company recorded a non cash charge of million  or million  net of tax  in the fourth quarter to recognize the decrease in fair value of its non utility investment in enermetrix 
the company has recorded a tax benefit of million for this capital loss that it expects to realize in the company recognized this valuation adjustment in to reflect significantly lower private equity valuation metrics for companies like enermetrix and changes in the business outlook of enermetrix 
enermetrix is a closely held  privately owned company and  as such  has no published market value 
unitil is a non controlling  minority investor in enermetrix 
among the contributing factors to management s decision for the reduction in fair value were the general economic downturn in the technology sector  the slower development of c ompetitive markets for energy supply and generally lower market valuations for companies like enermetrix 
the company s management considered various sources of information in determining its estimate of the fair value of its enermetrix investment at december   including previous valuations of enermetrix performed by independent investment banking firms and the enermetrix operating forecast 
where those valuations were based upon the value of comparable companies that are publicly traded  and the operating forecast of enermetrix  those statistics were updated and analyzed 
the company has valued its investment in enermetrix at december   at million 
future market value risk is inherent in this investment in enermetrix  which is an energy technology start up enterprise 
the company will continue to monitor the value of its investment and periodically assess the impact  if any  on future period reported earnings

capital requirements and liquidity unitil requires capital primarily for the addition of property  plant  and equipment in order to improve  protect  maintain  and expand its electric and gas distribution systems 
the capital necessary to meet these requirements is derived primarily from internally generated funds  which consist of cash flows from operating activities  excluding payments of dividends 
the company supplements internally generated funds  as needed  primarily through bank borrowings under unsecured short term bank lines 
as of december   the company had unsecured bank lines for short term debt aggregating million with three banks 
at december   the unused portion of these bank lines was million 
the amount of short term borrowings that may be incurred by unitil and its subsidiaries is subject to periodic approval either by the securities and exchange commission sec under the public utility holding company act of or by the respective state regulators 
in  the company received sec authoriza tion to allow unitil to incur total short term borrowings up to a maximum of million 
the company periodically repays its short term debt borrowings through the issuance of permanent long term debt financing 
the company expects to continue to be able to satisfy its external financing needs by issuing additional short term and long term debt 
the continued availability of these methods of financing will be dependent on many factors  including security market conditions  economic conditions  regulatory approvals and the level of the company s income and cash flow 
the sec recently issued a statement release nos 
  fr which discussed certain disclosures for inclusion in the financial reporting of public companies  specifically with respect to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in line with this statement  the company has provided the following table  which summarizes the significant contractual obligations of the company going forward 
significant contractual obligations s total year years years years and after long term debt note capital lease note power supply buyout ma note purchased power nh note gas supply obligations note total significant contractual obligations in addition to the significant contractual obligations listed in the above table  the company also provides limited guarantees on certain energy contracts entered into by its regulated subsidiary companies 
the term of these guarantees cannot exceed two years 
currently  there are million of guarantees outstanding and these guarantees expire within the next eighteen months 
cash flows from operating activities increased by million in  after decreasing by million in the decrease in and the corresponding increase in was primarily a result of changes in accrued revenues and accounts receivable  due to the impact of the volatile and rising energy markets in and early there is an inherent ratemaking lag between the period when energy costs increase and the period when the company collects those higher energy costs from customers 
this timing difference is recorded as accrued revenue 
during the collection lag period  as occurred in  the company s cash flow is negatively impacted and additional working capital related short term borrowings is necessary 
once the company begins to collect these higher costs through reconciling rate mechanisms  as it did in  cash flow increases and short term borrowings are repaid 
operating activities s cash flows used in investing activities decreased approximately million in  primarily reflecting a million reduction in capital expenditures on distribution system additions and improvements  the receipt of million of proceeds from the sale of the company s interest in millstone and reduction of unregulated investment activities 
cash flows used in investment activities increased approximately million in  primarily reflecting cash proceeds of million for the sale of the company s interest in new haven harbor station  which was received in capital expenditures are projected to decrease in to approximately million  primarily reflecting lower planned expenditures on the company s non regulated business activities offset by increased expenditures for utility distribution system improvements 
investing activities s cash flows from financing activities decreased by million in compared to this decrease primarily reflects proceeds received from the issuance of long term debt  offset by a repayment of short and long term borrowings 
during  three of the company s utility subsidiaries issued long term debt totaling million 
the proceeds were used to reduce short term debt aggregating million and to provide long term funding for a portion of its additions to gas and electric distribution plant and equipment see note 
cash flows from financing activities increased by million in compared to this increase reflected a higher level of borrowing in versus to fund the company s capital expenditure program and working capital requirements 
in particular  as previously discussed  the time lag between increases in energy costs and corresponding recovery from customers resulted in the company incurring short term debt to fund the interim working capital needs of the company s energy cost obligations 
as a result of rising and volatile wholesale gas and electric energy prices in and early  the company filed and obtained authorization from the sec under the act to increase its maximum short term borrowing level to million 
further  the company negotiated with its banks to increase its lines of credit to meet its borrowing obligations 
on several occasions  the company filed rate adjustments to its reconciling cost recovery mechanisms to reflect changes in wholesale energy prices during in  as wholesale energy prices declined significantly  the company obtained regulatory approval to reduce rates correspondingly to reflect lower energy costs 
during and  respectively  the company raised and million of additional common equity capital through the issuance of  and  shares of common stock in connection with the dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans 
during  the company moved to open market purchases to meet its share issuance obligations under these plans 
as a result  the company does not anticipate issuing new original issue shares of common stock in connection with these plans in the next year 
in conjunction with the sec emergency orders of september and   which suspended the applicability of certain of the conditions contained in its rule b  the company implemented an interim common stock repurchase program 
under this program  the company repurchased  canceled and retired  of its outstanding common shares at a total cost of  the sec has since lifted its suspension of the aforementioned conditions and accordingly  the company s interim common stock repurchase program is no longer in effect 
unitil s annual common stock dividend in was per share 
this annual dividend resulted in a payout ratio of  for the year  before the investment write down and extraordinary item 
excluding the loss from non regulated operations  the payout ratio was based on utility operations  before the investment write down and extraordinary item 
at its january meeting  the unitil board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend on the company s common stock of per share 
this quarterly dividend reflects the current annual dividend rate of per share 
financing activities s regulatory matters the unitil companies are regulated by various federal and state agencies  including the securities and exchange commission sec  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  and state regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over the utility industry  including the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc and the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy mdte 
in recent years  there has been significant legislative and regulatory activity to restructure the utility industry to introduce greater competition in the supply and sale of electricity and gas  while continuing to regulate the distribution operations of unitil s utility operating subsidiaries 
massachusetts enacted the electric restructuring act of the restructuring act requiring the comprehensive restructuring of the electric utility industry in the state 
since march   all electric consumers in massachusetts served by investor owned utilities have had the ability to choose their electric energy supplier 
fg e  the company s massachusetts based combination gas and electric utility  has continued to implement its comprehensive electric restructuring plan  and has completed the divestiture of its entire regulated power supply business  including its nuclear investment in millstone at the direction of the mdte  in  fg e and other massachusetts gas distribution utilities initiated an industry wide collaborative process to develop a common set of principles to restructure their gas service and implement the necessary infrastructure to offer gas customers choice of their competitive gas energy supplier 
fg e filed new gas tariffs with the mdte to implement natural gas unbundling in accordance with the principles resulting from this collaborative effort 
the mdte approved these tariffs and regulations governing the unbundling of gas services effective november in new hampshire  concord electric company ceco and exeter hampton electric company e h  the company s electric distribution operating subsidiaries  and unitil power corp 
upc  the company s wholesale power supply company  continue to prepare for the transition to a new market structure 
as discussed further below  on january   the companies filed a comprehensive restructuring proposal with the nhpuc to comply with the state s restructuring law and provide retail choice to its customers 
unitil has also been an active participant in the restructuring of the wholesale power market and transmission system in new england 
new wholesale markets have been implemented in the new england power pool nepool under the general supervision of an independent system operator iso and the regulatory oversight of the ferc 
massachusetts electric operations restructuring on january   the mdte approved the provisions of fg e s electric restructuring plan with certain modifications 
under the restructuring plan  fg e must provide its customers with a the ability to choose a competitive energy supplier  b an option to purchase standard offer service or default service provided by fg e  and c a cumulative rate reduction adjusted for inflation 
as a result of the restructuring and divestiture of fg e s entire generation and purchased power portfolio  fg e has accelerated the amortization of its stranded electric generation assets and its abandoned investment in seabrook station 
fg e continues to earn an authorized rate of return on the unamortized balance of these regulatory assets 
in addition  as a result of the rate reduction requirement of the restructuring act  fg e has been authorized to defer the recovery of a portion of its transition costs and standard offer service costs 
these unrecovered amounts are also recorded as regulatory assets and earn authorized carrying charges until their subsequent recovery in future periods 
as the value of fg e s regulatory assets are amortized and or recovered over the next eight to ten years  income from this segment of fg e s utility business will continue to decline and ultimately cease 
in accordance with its restructuring plan  each year fg e adjusts its unbundled rate components  including the component that recovers its transition costs  to reconcile any differences between its estimated and actual costs from the prior year 
these rate adjustments are subject to the required inflation adjusted rate discount 
fg e has made three such filings in   and rate adjustments were approved for effect during the subsequent year  subject to further investigation 
the investigation of fg e s initial reconciliation filing was initiated in on october  and october   the mdte issued a series of regulatory orders in several pending cases involving fg e  including a final order on fg e s initial reconciliation filing 
those orders included the review and disposition of issues related to the company s recovery of transition costs due to the restructuring of the electric industry in massachusetts  as well as certain costs associated with gas industry restructuring and preparation and litigation of performance based rate proceedings initiated by the mdte 
the orders determined the final treatment of regulatory assets that fg e had sought to recover from its massachusetts electric customers over a multi year transition period that began in fg e has now determined that it is authorized to recover approximately million of regulatory assets attributable to stranded generation assets  purchased power costs and related expenses 
as a result of these orders  fg e recorded a non cash adjustment to regulatory assets of million in the third quarter of  which resulted in the recognition of an extraordinary charge of million after taxes 
fg e will continue to be subject to annual mdte investigation and review in order to reconcile its restructuring related costs and revenues  including its transition charge and standard offer service charge 
fg e s third annual reconciliation and rate adjustment filing  filed on december   included a recast of its rates from through in compliance with the mdte s final order on its initial reconciliation filing 
the investigation of the initial reconciliation filing specifically covered the period march through october  however most of the mdte s cost recovery findings apply after october as well 
as part of this filing  fg e also reduced its standard offer service fuel adjustment sosfa reflecting lower fuel oil and natural gas costs 
the sosfa is a rate mechanism approved as part of restructuring plans in massachusetts that provides for the recovery of excessive fuel costs based on a fuel trigger 
revenues collected under the trigger are passed on to standard offer service suppliers 
under the proposed sosfa  fg e estimates that all of its sosfa related costs  including deferred amounts of about million  will be recovered by the end of november on december   the mdte approved fg e s sosfa and base rates for effect january   subject to further investigation 
with the mdte s resolution of cost recovery issues in its october orders and anticipated final approval of fg e s compliance filing  fg e s financial risk associated with its unbundled cost recovery mechanisms is significantly reduced 
the mdte also allowed fg e to implement the sosfa for fg e is required to notify the mdte days in advance of when all sosfa related costs are projected to be recovered 
massachusetts gas operations restructuring as indicated above  in  the mdte directed all massachusetts natural gas local distribution companies ldcs to form a collaborative with other stakeholders to develop common principles and appropriate regulations for the unbundling of gas service 
in november  the ldcs petitioned the mdte for approval of regulations governing the unbundling of gas services that were developed with the input of participants of the collaborative 
effective november   the mdte adopted these regulations and ldc tariffs  including those of fg e  filed in accordance with the principles developed in the collaborative process 
retail customers are now free to choose a competitive gas supplier  if they wish 
as part of this proceeding  in february  the mdte issued an order in which it determined that the ldcs would continue to have an obligation to provide gas supply and delivery services for another five years  with a review after three years 
this order also set forth the mdte s decision requiring mandatory assignment by ldcs of their pipeline capacity contracts to competitive marketers 
new hampshire electric operations restructuring on february   the nhpuc issued its final plan in response to the new hampshire electric restructuring law rsa f  passed into law in  for new hampshire electric utilities to transition to a competitive electric market in the state 
the final plan linked the interim recovery of stranded cost by the state s utilities to a comparison of their existing rates with the regional average utility rates 
ceco s and e h s rates are below the regional average  thus  the nhpuc found that ceco and e h were entitled to full interim stranded cost recovery 
however  the nhpuc also made certain legal rulings that could affect ceco s and e h s long term ability to recover all of their stranded costs 
the company cannot predict the final outcome of the restructuring of its utility operations in new hampshire but believes that final resolution of this restructuring process will result in recovery of substantially all its stranded and restruct uring related costs 
northeast utilities affiliate  public service company of new hampshire psnh  filed suit in us district court for protection from the final plan and related orders and was granted an indefinite stay 
in june  unitil  and other utilities in new hampshire  intervened as plaintiffs in the federal court proceeding 
in june  the federal court clarified that the injunctions issued by the court in had effectively frozen the nhpuc s efforts to implement restructuring 
this amended injunction has been challenged by the nhpuc  and affirmed by the first circuit court of appeals 
unitil continues to be a plaintiff intervenor in federal district court 
in october  the nhpuc approved a settlement for the restructuring of psnh  which was implemented on may  the company has continued to work actively to explore settlement options and to seek a fair and reasonable resolution of key restructuring policies and issues in new hampshire 
the company is also monitoring the regulatory and legislative proceedings dealing with electric restructuring in the state 
as indicated above  the company filed a comprehensive restructuring proposal with the nhpuc on january  if approved  the company would withdraw its complaint from the federal court proceeding 
the restructuring proposal  if approved  will go into effect on or before november  under the restructuring proposal  the company s customers will be allowed to choose a competitive energy supplier  while electricity delivery services will continue to be provided by unitil 
unitil will sell its portfolio of electricity supply contracts and recover the residual stranded costs over a period of years 
unitil will offer customers a three year transition service at specified prices and a permanent default ser vice 
these services will be procured from the competitive wholesale market 
as part of the restructuring  unitil is also proposing to combine ceco  e h  and the remaining functions of upc into a single distribution utility  unitil energy systems  inc as part of the filing  unitil filed new  consolidated tariff and rate schedules for distribution service in nh and is seeking an increase in base rates for distribution service 
rate levels and rate components applicable to all unitil customers will change as a result  but overall rate levels are expected to be below rate levels in effect at the time of filing 
rate proceedings aside from unitil s nh restructuring proposal discussed above  the last formal regulatory filings initiated by the company to increase base rates for unitil s three retail electric operating subsidiaries occurred in for ceco  for fg e  and for e h 
a majority of the company s electric operating revenues are collected under various periodic rate adjustment mechanisms including fuel  purchased power  cost of gas  energy efficiency  and restructuring related cost recovery mechanisms 
electric industry restructuring will continue to change the methods of how certain costs are recovered through the company s regulated rates and tariffs 
on the gas side  during fg e s gas base rate case proceeding  the massachusetts attorney general alleged that fg e had over collected fuel inventory finance charges  and requested that the mdte require fg e to refund approximately million of charges collected since the company believes that the attorney general s claim is without merit and that a refund was not justified or warranted 
following the mdte s november  order initiating an investigation  the mdte held hearings in on may   the mdte issued an order in this proceeding  finding that fg e had over collected the costs in its cost of gas adjustment clause cgac mechanism and ordered fg e to return these costs  in the approximate amount of million plus accumulated and future interest  to customers over the same number of years they were collected 
on october   fg e filed a motion for stay pending appeal and memorandum of law in support with the supreme judicial court sjc 
on november   the sjc denied the motion for stay  stating that any refunds made by fg e may be recouped if fg e prevails before the sjc on the merits of its claims 
fg e has begun to implement a multi year refund of approximately million per year through its cgac mechanism in compliance with the mdte s order 
the review of the mdte order by the sjc is currently pending 
fg e continues to assert that no refund is justified or warranted as a matter of fact or law  however  management cannot predict the outcome of this litigation 
on december   the massachusetts attorney general filed a complaint under gl c 
 sec 
 against fg e requesting that the mdte investigate the distribution rates  rate of return  and depreciation accrual rates for fg e s electric operations in calendar year the mdte opened a proceeding in november and investigated the matter in on october   the mdte issued an order  finding that fg e s electric distribution base rates would annually generate an excess of approximately million in revenue and ordered fg e to reduce its electric base rates  effective that same day 
fg e submitted its compliance filing on october   and received approval of its filing on october  performance based ratemaking on october   the mdte initiated a proceeding to establish guidelines for service quality standards to be included in performance based ratemaking pbr plans for all electric and gas distribution utilities in massachusetts 
pbr is a method of setting regulated distribution rates that provides incentives for utilities to control costs while maintaining a high level of service quality 
under pbr  a company s earnings are tied to performance targets and penalties can be imposed for deterioration of service quality 
the mdte issued an order on june   establishing guidelines for implementation of service quality measurement programs by gas and electric companies operating under pbr 
on october   fg e filed its service quality plan for its gas and electric divisions as required by the mdte 
on december   fg e received approval of its service quality plan for its electric division  subject to modification pending the conclusion of the s ervice quality proceeding 
approval of the plan for the gas division is pending 
fg e s gas division will be filing a pbr plan in april the requirement to file a pbr plan for the gas division stems from fg e s gas rate case 
fg e is required to file a pbr plan for its electric division in its next electric rate case 
the company is preparing to file such a plan in april the pbr plan will establish new distribution rates through a traditional cost of service rate proceeding  service quality standards and penalties  and procedures for adjusting retail rates to reflect cost inflation and other factors over the term of the pbr plan 
environmental matters sawyer passway mgp site the company continues to work with environmental regulatory agencies to identify and assess environmental issues at the former manufactured gas plant mgp site at sawyer passway  located in fitchburg  massachusetts 
fg e  the company s massachusetts utility operating subsidiary  has proceeded with site remediation work as specified on the tier b permit issued by the massachusetts department of environmental protection dep  which allows the company to work towards temporary remediation of the site 
the last remaining portion of environmental remediation work necessary to achieve temporary closure of the sawyer passway mgp site was completed in late a status of temporary closure requires fg e to monitor the site until a feasible permanent remediation alternative can be developed and completed 
since  fg e has recovered the environmental response costs incurred at this former mgp site pursuant to a mdte approved settlement agreement agreement between fg e  certain other massachusetts gas utilities and the massachusetts attorney general 
the agreement allows fg e to amortize and recover from gas customers over succeeding seven year periods the environmental response costs incurred each year 
environmental response costs are defined to include liabilities related to manufactured gas sites  waste disposal sites or other sites onto which hazardous material may have migrated as a result of the operation or decommissioning of massachusetts gas manufacturing facilities from through fg e does not recover carrying charges associated with these costs and any tax benefits related to the payment of such costs are credited to customers in the year they are realized 
in addition  any recovery that fg e receives from insurance or third parties with respect to environmental response costs  net of the unrecovered costs associated therewith  are split equally between fg e and customers 
the total annual charge for such cost assessed to customers cannot exceed five percent of fg e s total revenue for firm gas sales during the preceding year 
cost in excess of five percent will be deferred for recovery in subsequent years 
former electric generating station the company is investigating environmental conditions at a former electric generating station located at sawyer passway  which fg e sold to wrw  a general partnership  in rockware international corporation rockware  an affiliate of wrw  acquired rights to the electric equipment in the building and intended to remove  recondition and sell this equipment 
during  rockware demolished several exterior walls of the generating station in order to facilitate removal of certain equipment 
the demolition of the walls and the removal of generating equipment resulted in damage to asbestos containing insulation materials inside the building  which had been intact and encapsulated at time of the sale of the structure to wrw 
when rockware and wrw encountered financial difficulties and ignored orders of the environmental regulators to remedy the situation  fg e agreed to take steps and obtained dep approval to temporarily enclose  secure and stabilize the facility 
based on that approval  between september and december  contractors retained by the company stabilized the facility and secured the building 
this work did not permanently resolve the asbestos problems caused by rockware  but was deemed sufficient for the then foreseeable future 
fg e  working closely with the dep and the massachusetts attorney general  brought an action in in the worcester superior court  against rockware 
on july   fg e filed an amended complaint and obtained a preliminary injunction barring rockware from removing anything of value from the fitchburg facility and barring it from further encumbering the property 
it also obtained an attachment encumbering all of rockware s goods  equipment and property  located in fitchburg  massachusetts 
on june   fg e  rockware and wrw entered into an agreement for judgement in favor of the company in the amount of million and the preliminary injunctions became permanent 
fg e has been unable to collect any amounts from wrw and or rockware due to their bankruptcies 
in addition to its efforts to obtain reimbursement and indemnification from wrw and rockware  fg e entered into negotiations with its insurers 
fg e reached an interim settlement with its excess insurer and a final settlement with its primary insurer  which provided reimbursement for most of the costs that had been incurred to secure and stabilize the facility at that time 
due to the continuing deterioration of this former electric generating station and rockware s continued lack of performance  fg e  in concert with the dep and the us environmental protection agency epa  conducted further testing and survey work during to ascertain the environmental status of the building 
these recent surveys have revealed continued deterioration of the asbestos containing insulation materials in the building 
during an informal meeting on february   the epa and dep indicated to the company that remedial actions are necessary 
the company anticipates receiving a notice of responsibility from the epa by the end of the first quarter of the company anticipates that this notice will require specific remedial action  including abatement and removal of asbestos containing materials 
at this time  the company is uncertain as to the cost of the further remedial action that may be required by environmental regulators or for what portion of the cost the company will be hel d responsible 
however  the company believes that its liability insurance policies will provide significant coverage for the costs of any clean up effort and that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position 
market risk although unitil s utility operating companies are active in markets which are subject to commodity price risk  the current regulatory framework within which these companies operate allows for full collection of fuel and gas costs in rates 
consequently  there is limited commodity price risk exposure after consideration of the related rate making 
as the utility industry continues to deregulate  the company will be divesting its commodity related energy businesses and therefore will be further reducing its exposure to commodity related risk
