bulk alcohol products 
the company produces and sells citrus brandy  citrus spirits  rum  cane spirits and fortified citrus wine in the united states and internationally

the company is the largest supplier of citrus brandy  bulk rum and fortified citrus wine in the united states 
the company sells its bulk alcohol products to over producers of beverage alcohol in the united states and exports products to approximately foreign countries

rum and cane spirits are distilled from sugar cane molasses and are sold to other bottlers of rum  producers of beverage alcohol  food companies and flavor manufacturers 
rum is also used in the company s premium branded spirits and bottling operations 
management believes that the company s proximity to raw materials and its use of citrus byproducts in the production of bulk alcohol provide it with cost advantages over competitors products 
because end products are taxed on a blended rate based upon the ingredients used rather than on the resulting alcohol content of the end product  beverage alcohol producers can lower excise taxes on their products by substituting fortified citrus wine for distilled spirits alternatives 
this cost savings arises because fortified citrus wine is currently subject to federal excise taxes of per gallon  whereas distilled spirits are taxed at per proof gallon one proof gallon is approximately equivalent in alcohol content to two and one half gallons of fortified citrus wine 
the ability of beverage alcohol producers to substitute fortified citrus wine for distilled spirits varies by end product in accordance with government regulations 
for example  fortified citrus wine may contribute up to of the alcohol content of cordials and liqueurs  and up to approximately of the alcohol content of canadian whiskey

raw materials 
the principal raw materials used in the company s distilling operations are citrus molasses  a byproduct of citrus juice production  and cane molasses  a byproduct of sugar production 
citrus molasses  which is used in the production of citrus brandy and citrus spirits  accounted for approximately of the raw materials used in the company s distilling operations in fiscal cane molasses  which is used in the production of rum and cane spirits  accounted for the remaining 
citrus juice concentrate is the primary raw material used in the company s winery operations 
the company purchases such raw materials from a variety of suppliers 
the company purchases distilled products  used in its bulk alcohol products and bottling operations businesses  from several suppliers 
glass bottles and other materials  such as caps  labels and cardboard cartons  are used in bottling and packaging and are available from numerous suppliers 
alcohol and grape juice concentrate are the primary raw materials used in the company s vinegar and cooking wine operations 
during fiscal  two suppliers each accounted for more than of all of the company s raw material purchases 
the cost of raw materials fluctuates depending upon a number of factors  including crop conditions  weather  governmental programs and purchases by foreign governments 
fluctuations in operating results  seasonality the size and timing of purchase orders and product shipments can cause operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  particularly since some customers purchase bulk alcohol products in significant quantities or place significant orders for contract bottling services  distilled spirits  vinegar and cooking wine 
additionally  some company products generate higher profit margins than others  and changes in the company s product mix will therefore cause gross margins to fluctuate 
certain aspects of the company s business are also seasonal  with increased demand for the company s contract bottling services from april to october and increased production of the company s bulk alcohol products from november to june  corresponding to the florida citrus harvest 
as a result of these factors  the company s operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
marketing and distribution bulk alcohol products are sold primarily in large quantities through company employed salespeople 
the company s marketing strategy emphasizes the cost advantages of these products over other ingredients available to end producers 
bulk alcohol products are sold primarily to other bottlers  distillers and end producers located throughout the united states and canada 
the company produces  imports  markets and sells premium branded spirits to wholesalers in the united states and internationally 
the company s marketing and promotional programs for its premium brands are directed at consumers  retailers and wholesalers 
the company sells proprietary and private label spirits to wholesalers for distribution primarily in the southeastern united states 
the company s marketing strategy for these products places primary emphasis upon promotional programs emphasizing the company s cost advantages  directed at wholesalers and retailers  rather than consumers 
wholesalers market these products to retailers who then market them directly to consumers 
although competition for retail shelf space in the beverage alcohol industry is significant  wholesalers of such products  and not the company  generally must address such competition  although the company s promotional programs may affect the allocation of retail shelf space for its products 
sales of the company s premium branded spirits and proprietary and private label products are generally made fob free on board at the company s facilities and  accordingly  the purchasers of such products are responsible for the risk of loss and transportation costs 
in addition to its own salesforce  the company works through various brokers to develop and service its sales to wholesalers and retailers 
the company s marketing strategy with respect to its contract bottling services emphasizes the cost advantages and quality of the company s services

vinegar and cooking wine are sold primarily in large quantities to manufacturers  distributors and retailers through the company s own salesforce 
these products are also sold through wholesalers and directly to retailers under the company s proprietary labels and under the private labels of retailers 
competition the areas of the beverage alcohol industry in which the company does business are highly competitive with respect to price  service and product quality  and there are several companies with substantially greater financial and other resources than the company 
the company s citrus based bulk alcohol products compete primarily with producers of grape based products 
while the company is aware of only two other domestic producers of citrus brandy and spirits  there are several producers of grape based distilled products 
the company s proprietary and private label products and premium branded spirits compete on a regional and national basis against other distilled spirits products  including premium labels  mid price and popular price products 
the proprietary label and premium branded spirits produced by the company compete with those of companies for whom the company performs contract bottling services and to whom the company sells its bulk alcohol products 
the company believes that its relationships with its customers are good  and it has not experienced any adverse effects  such as termination or non renewal of ongoing contracts  as a result of competition 
in addition  the company does not expect to experience any material adverse effects from such competition in the foreseeable future 
contract bottling operations compete against other bottlers located throughout the southeastern united states 
the company experiences similar competition in its vinegar and cooking wine operations 
while management believes that it has achieved a strong competitive position in the markets it serves  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its competitive position in the future 
regulation and taxation producing  importing and selling wine and spirits is subject to extensive regulation by certain federal and state agencies  and the company is required to obtain various permits  bonds and licenses to comply with these regulations 
pursuant to federal and state environmental requirements  the company is required to obtain permits and licenses to operate certain facilities  and to treat and remove effluents discharged from its distilling  winery and bottling operations 
management believes it is presently in material compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations 
beverage alcohol produced and bottled by the company is subject to substantial federal excise taxes 
as of september   excise taxes were being imposed at flat rates of per proof gallon for distilled spirits and per gallon for fortified wine 
the company s fortified wine products  as an ingredient of beverage alcohol  have a cost advantage under the component method of taxation  which taxes wine at a lower rate than distilled spirits 
changes in  or the elimination of  the component method of taxation  as it relates to wine  would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
employees as of september   the company had approximately full time employees 
additional workers are generally employed at the company s bottling facilities during the summer months  when the bulk of contract bottling takes place 
none of the company s employees is a member of any labor union nor are there any collective bargaining agreements between the company and its employees  with the exception of of the company s virgin islands employees

certain amounts presented in this item have been rounded to the nearest thousand and hundred thousand  as applicable  but the percentages are based on actual amounts without rounding 
the company operates primarily in the beverage alcohol industry in the united states 
the company reports its operating results in five segments bulk alcohol products citrus brandy  citrus spirits  rum  cane spirits  fortified citrus wine  purchased distilled products and byproducts  premium branded spirits primarily cruzan estate rums and cruzan flavored rums  bottling operations contract bottling services and proprietary and private label products  vinegar and cooking wine bulk vinegar  bulk cooking wine  vinegar stock and proprietary and private label case goods  and corporate operations and other primarily corporate related items 
information regarding net sales  operating income loss and total assets of each of the company s business segments and information regarding geographic areas is set forth in note to the company s consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k

the company s net sales and gross margins gross profit as a percentage of net sales vary depending on the mix of business among the company s products 
historically  gross margins have been highest in bulk alcohol products and premium branded spirits and lower in bottling operations and vinegar and cooking wine operations 
within its bottling operations  sales and gross margins have varied substantially based upon the mix of business from the company s type a and type b bottling customers 
type a bottling customers pay the company to purchase their raw materials and these costs are passed through to the customer 
type b bottling customers supply their own raw materials and are only charged for bottling charges 
although gross profit per case for the company s type a and type b bottling customers is approximately equal  given the same case volume  net sales and cost of goods sold with respect to products bottled for type a bottling customers are higher  and gross margins are lower  than for type b bottling customers 
as a result  significant fluctuations in volume of type a bottling customers can distort the company s gross margin 
the size and timing of purchase orders and product shipments can cause operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  particularly since some customers purchase bulk alcohol products in significant quantities or place significant orders for contract bottling services  distilled spirits  vinegar and cooking wine 
additionally  some company products generate higher profit margins than others  and changes in the company s product mix will therefore cause gross margins to fluctuate 
certain aspects of the company s business are also seasonal  with increased demand for the company s contract bottling services from april to october and increased production of the company s bulk alcohol products from november to june  corresponding to the florida citrus harvest 
as a result of these factors  the company s operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
net sales represent the company s gross sales less excise taxes 
excise taxes are generally payable on products bottled by the company 
in addition  excise taxes are payable on sales of industrial alcohol to certain customers 
accordingly  excise taxes vary from period to period depending upon the company s product and customer mix 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales were million in and net sales of bulk alcohol products were million in  a decrease of from net sales of million in the decrease resulted primarily from decreased sales of citrus brandy  citrus spirits  rum and fortified wine 
the company s bulk alcohol product sales have declined primarily due to increased competition 
net sales of premium branded spirits were million in  an increase of from net sales of million in in  net sales of premium branded spirits included million of bulk tequila sales and million of new cruzan ready to drink products 
bulk tequila sales represent the liquidation of inventory that was held to produce porfidio tequila 
during the third quarter of  the company introduced a new line of cruzan products in the ready to drink category  sales of which are included in the company s premium branded spirits segment 
the company sold approximately  cases of this new product  representing net sales of million through september  sales of the company s cruzan ready to drink products are highly seasonal and there can be no assurance that sales of these products will continue at this level in the future 
in addition  due to more competition within the ready to drink product category  the gross margin on the cruzan ready to drink products is lower than other premium branded spirits in this segment 
the company is repositioning its cruzan ready to drink products for the spring summer season and is pursuing opportunities in the export market 
excluding bulk tequila and cruzan ready to drink product sales  net sales of premium branded spirits were million in  an increase of from net sales of million in sales of the company s cruzan estate rums and cruzan flavored rums increased million and million  or and  respectively  in compared to these sales increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of porfidio tequila

net sales of the company s bottling operations were million in  a decrease of from net sales of million in the unit volume of the company s bottling operations decreased in as a result of decreased business with a large bottling customer 
in addition  during the company lost a contract bottling customer that represented approximately of its unit volume in bottling operations 
management believes that this loss in volume will be partially offset by increased business with new and existing customers and that total bottling operations volume may decline by approxiately in net sales of vinegar and cooking wine were million in  an increase of from net sales of million in gross profit 
gross profit was million in  a decrease of from gross profit of million in gross margin decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to a change in product mix as the unit volume of higher margin bulk alcohol products declined

unit sales of citrus spirits decreased and unit sales of wine products increased in compared to these changes resulted from the monarch acquisition  as monarch was a major purchaser of the company s citrus spirits for use in producing fortified citrus wine 
net sales of premium branded spirits were million in  an increase of from net sales of million in this increase reflected the continued success of the company s cruzan estate rums and cruzan flavored rums 
sales of the company s cruzan estate rums and cruzan flavored rums increased and  respectively  in compared to the strong sales increases in cruzan estate rums and cruzan flavored rums were partially offset by a decrease in sales of porfidio tequila 
as of september   the company was out of stock of porfidio tequila 
the company has not received a shipment of porfidio tequila since march  and cannot predict when or whether shipments of porfidio will resume 
during june  mexican regulatory authorities alleged that the porfidio distillery violated certain regulations related to the sale of tequila and have prohibited the export of porfidio tequila 
the allegations have been denied by the porfidio distillery

financial liquidity and capital resources general the company s principal use of cash in its operating activities is for purchasing raw materials to be used in its manufacturing operations  purchasing imported products for its premium branded spirits business and carrying inventories and the subsequent receivables 
the company s source of liquidity has historically been cash flow from operations and its line of credit 
some of the company s manufacturing operations are seasonal and the company s borrowings on its line of credit vary during the year 
for example  the company uses citrus molasses as its primary raw material in the production of citrus brandy and spirits at its two florida distilleries 
the company buys citrus molasses  a byproduct of citrus juice production  from local manufacturers of citrus juice and concentrate during the citrus harvest  which generally runs from november to june 
the company generally begins purchasing citrus molasses in november and builds inventory of citrus brandy and spirits 
the company must manufacture and build inventory while raw materials are available due to the short life of the citrus molasses it purchases 
another seasonal business of the company is its contract bottling services 
demand for contract bottling services is highest from april through october 
management believes that cash provided by its operating and financing activities will provide adequate resources to satisfy its working capital  liquidity and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both its short term and long term capital needs 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in was million  which resulted from million in net income adjusted for noncash items  and a million net change in operating assets and liabilities 
investing and financing activities net cash used in investing activities in was million  including capital expenditures of million partially offset by a net redemption of short term investments of million 
net cash used in financing activities in was million  which resulted primarily from a million increase in borrowings under the revolving credit facility  offset by million of payments on long term debt and 
million in refinancing costs 
in october  the company s previous long term debt and line of credit were replaced with a million credit agreement between the company and a syndicate of lenders 
the current credit agreement consists of a million revolving credit facility which expires in october  and a term loan with an initial amount of million which matures on september  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the company s long term debt 
the company s bank debt was million as of september   and its ratio of total debt to equity was to the company s share of the undistributed earnings of its bahamian and virgin islands subsidiaries was approximately million and million  respectively  as of september  no provision has been made for taxes which would result from the remittance of such undistributed earnings  as the company intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes related to these subsidiaries 
based on current plans and business conditions  management expects that its cash and cash equivalents  together with any amounts generated from operations and available borrowings  will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements for at least the next months 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policy is subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the company has goodwill and intangible assets associated with business acquisitions 
the company reviews these assets for impairment annually and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of these assets below their carrying value 
if the fair value of these assets is less than their carrying value  then an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset

this statement supersedes sfas no

but eliminates the requirement to allocate goodwill to long lived assets to be tested for impairment 
this statement also requires discontinued operations to be carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  with early application encouraged 
the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position
