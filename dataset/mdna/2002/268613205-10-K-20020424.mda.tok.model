at december   the company was in violation of the funded debt to ebitda covenant and other non financial covenants  and therefore was in default under the provisions of this credit agreement

the consolidated financial statements include a report of independent certified public accountants which indicates that these provisions raise substantial doubt as to the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
management believes it will be successful in obtaining financing to replace the amounts due under the new credit agreement prior to its maturity on january  in the event that sufficient additional financing cannot be obtained prior to the maturity date to repay amounts due under the agreement  the company believes several options are available to generate additional liquidity

management believes that cash generated by operations plus cash available under the new credit agreement will be sufficient to fund future operations  including interest payments on bank debt and payments due under the phantom stock option plan 
management believes that the bank line of credit and term loan with bofa under the new credit agreement will be refinanced prior to its maturity date of january  critical accounting policies 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of the company s accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
as with all judgments  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  current economic trends in the industry  information provided by customers and vendors and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the company s significant accounting policies include allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on numerous factors  including past transaction history with particular customers and their creditworthiness 
initially  the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience 
this estimate is periodically adjusted when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable 
while the company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed  a slowdown in the markets in which the company operates may result in higher than expected uncollectible accounts  and therefore the need to revise the estimate for bad debts 
generally  cues has experienced relatively low bad debt expense partially because customers depend on the company to provide parts and labor to repair and service equipment  which gives them a strong incentive to pay past due balances 
the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled  and  at december  and inventories 
the company evaluates its inventory balances at the end of each quarter to ensure that they are carried at the lower of cost or market 
this evaluation includes a review for obsolete inventory and an analysis of slow moving and potential excess inventory items 
events which could affect the amount of reserves for obsolete or slow moving inventory include a decrease in demand for cues s products due to economic conditions  innovations or new technology introduced by cues or its competitors  price decreases by competitors on specific products or systems  and the discontinuance by a vendor of a component part required in production requiring a re design of a cues product 
at december  and  the reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory was  and  respectively 
deferred tax assets 
the company s net deferred tax assets include substantial amounts of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  totaling  at december  the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in increased income tax expense 
the company continually reviews the adequacy of the valuation allowance and is recognizing deferred tax asset benefits only as reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the benefits will be realized 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income would affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets 
the utilization of the company s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be impaired or reduced under certain circumstances 
events which may affect the company s ability to utilize these carryforwards include  but are not limited to  future profitability  cumulative stock ownership changes of or more over a given three year period  as defined by internal revenue code irc  and the timing of the utilization of the tax benefit carryforwards 
such changes in ownership would significantly restrict the company s ability to utilize loss and credit carryforwards in accordance with the irc 
related party notes receivable 
the company is owed substantial amounts under related party promissory notes receivable see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these notes have been reflected in the equity section of the balance sheet as a contra equity account at december  alexander m 
milley and certain companies he controls have guaranteed payment of these notes 
in addition  mr 
milley and these companies have pledged certain assets  including company stock  under pledge and security agreements 
a decline in the value of the company s stock or other pledged assets or a default in the payment of the principal and interest by these related parties would have a negative effect on the company s operating results and potentially its ability to repay outstanding debt 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company s long lived assets include  of goodwill and trademarks at december  in assessing the recoverability of the company s intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
the company will adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in and will be required to analyze its goodwill for impairment issues during the first six months of  and then on a periodic basis thereafter 
during the year ended december   the company did not record any impairment losses related to goodwill and or trademarks 
product warranties 
our warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas requires that an entity recognize all derivative instruments in its balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is designated as a hedge  depending on the nature of the underlying exposure  changes in the fair value are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item or recognized in other comprehensive income expense until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of the derivative s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings 
fas no 
 business combinations and fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  were issued in july fas requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
fas also specifies the criteria which must be met in order for certain acquired intangible assets to be recorded separately from goodwill 
fas is effective for the company beginning with the company s first quarter of under fas  goodwill will no longer be amortized but rather will be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
this new approach requires the use of valuation techniques and methodologies significantly different than the present undiscounted cash flow policy utilized by the company 
in connection with the adoption of fas  the company s conclusions about the valuation and recoverability of goodwill may change 
the new approach may result in impairment charges and reductions in the carrying amount of goodwill its consolidated balance sheets 
subsequent to the initial adoption of fas  the company may be subject to earnings volatility if additional goodwill impairment occurs at a future date 
the company is in the process of performing the goodwill evaluation required under fas and accordingly  has not yet determined the impact that will result from adoption 
fas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations was issued in june fas  which is effective for the company beginning in  addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and associated asset retirement costs 
the company does not expect the adoption of fas to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
fas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets was issued in august fas  which is effective beginning with the company s first quarter of  establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  and also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
the company does not expect the adoption of fas to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
market risk s 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on borrowed funds  which could affect its results of operations and financial condition 
at december   the company had approximately million in variable  market rate based debt outstanding 
the market risk is considered minimal based upon a increase or decrease in interest rates from their december  levels 
the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement that provides for a fixed interest rate see note to the consolidated financial statements on a portion of the debt totaling million between july  and march  and million thereafter until termination originally scheduled for march  the company terminated the interest rate swap agreement in april in conjunction with the execution of the company s new credit agreement resulting in a termination payment of approximately
