item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our operations have continued to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue 
significant reductions in sales to any of our large customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the level and timing of orders placed by a customer vary due to the customer s attempts to balance its inventory  design modifications  changes in a customer s manufacturing strategy  acquisitions of or consolidations among customers  and variation in demand for a customer s products due to  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
termination of manufacturing relationships or changes  reductions or delays in orders could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  as has occurred in the past 
our results also depend to a substantial extent on the success of our oem customers in marketing their products 
we continue to seek to diversify our customer base to reduce our reliance on our few major customers 
see business strategy and customers under item  business 
the industry segments we serve  and the electronics industry as a whole  are subject to rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
discontinuance or modification of products containing components manufactured by the company could adversely affect our results of operations 
the electronics industry is also subject to economic cycles and has in the past experienced  and is likely in the future to experience  recessionary periods 
a prolonged worldwide recession in the electronics industry  as we have experienced  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results were adversely impacted by the severe instabilities experienced during the last months in the telecommunications industry as well as a general downturn in the us economy over the preceding year 
we typically do not obtain long term volume purchase contracts from our customers  but rather we work with our customers to anticipate future volumes of orders 
based upon such anticipated future orders  we will make commitments regarding the level of business we want and can accomplish the timing of production schedules and the levels of and utilization of facilities and personnel 
occasionally  we purchase raw materials without a customer order or commitment 
customers may cancel  delay or reduce orders  usually without penalty  for a variety of reasons  whether relating to the customer or the industry in general  which orders are already made or anticipated 
any significant cancellations  reductions or order delays could adversely affect our results of operations 
we use electronic data interchange edi with both our customers and our suppliers in our efforts to continuously develop accurate forecasts of customer volume requirements  as well as sharing our future requirements with our suppliers 
we depend on the timely availability of many components 
component shortages could result in manufacturing and shipping delays or increased component prices  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
it is important for us to efficiently manage inventory  proper timing of expenditures and allocations of physical and personnel resources in anticipation of future sales  the evaluation of economic conditions in the electronics industry and the mix of products  whether pcbs  wire harnesses  cables  or turnkey products  for manufacture 
see electronic manufacturing industry and supplies and materials management under item  business and results of operations below 
we must continuously develop improved manufacturing procedures to accommodate our customers needs for increasingly complex products 
to continue to grow and be a successful competitor  we must be able to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities  develop and market manufacturing services which meet changing customer needs and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis 
although we believe that our operations utilize the assembly and testing technologies and equipment currently required by our customers  there can be no assurance that our process development efforts will be successful or that the emergence of new technologies  industry standards or customer requirements will not render our technology  equipment or processes obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  to the extent that we determine that new assembly and testing technologies and equipment are required to remain competitive  the acquisition and implementation of such technologies and equipment are likely to require significant capital investment 
during periods of recession in the electronics industry  as we have experienced in  our competitive advantages in the areas of quick turnaround manufacturing and responsive customer service may be of reduced importance to electronic oems  who may become more price sensitive 
our results of operations are also affected by other factors  including price competition  the level and timing of customer orders  fluctuations in material costs due to availability  the overhead efficiencies achieved by management in managing the costs of our operations  our experience in manufacturing a particular product  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased orders  selling  and general and administrative expenses 
accordingly  gross margins and operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high volume and high capacity utilization 
we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating margins during periods of lower volume production 
we compete with much larger electronic manufacturing entities for expansion opportunities 
any acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  the incidence of debt and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  and other costs and expenses  all of which could materially adversely affect our financial results 
acquisition transactions also involve numerous business risks  including difficulties in successfully integrating the acquired operations  technologies and products or formalizing anticipated synergies  and the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns 
results of operations the following is a discussion of the key factors that have affected our business over the last three years 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related footnotes included herein 
compared to consolidated revenues decreased approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
there was a decrease in domestic sales of   and a decrease in european sales of  compared to the preceding year 
the sale decrease was due primarily to a decrease in our shipments to our customers in the telecommunications industry and to a lesser degree the general overall business decline in compared to interest and other income increased by approximately  compared to the preceding year 
this increase reflects the recognition of a  deferred gain on sale of a buildings to medicore 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in part iv of this report 
significant reductions in sales of techdyne europe during recent years have resulted in continuing losses 
net losses for this subsidiary amounted to  for the year ended december   and  for the preceding year 
as a result of continuing operating losses  in april we decided to discontinue the manufacturing operations of techdyne europe 
we incurred a cost of approximately  for closing our scottish manufacturing operations  primarily for severance benefits associated with employees 
in may  techdyne europe entered into a management agreement with simclar whereby simclar undertook to manufacture products for techdyne europe and assist in management coordination 
subsequently on february   the company entered into an agreement with simclar to transfer  at net book value  all operating assets and all liabilities of techdyne europe  with the exception the land and building 
the company plans to liquidate its european subsidiary when the land and building are sold 
the company believes that the liquidation of this subsidiary will not require any additional write down losses 
approximately of our consolidated sales for were made to five customers 
illinois tool works itw is the only customer that accounts for more than of our total sales 
the loss of or substantially reduced sales to any major customer would have an adverse effect on our operations if such sales were not replaced 
see item  business customers 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales amounted to for the year ended december   and for the preceding year 
we experienced decreases in utilization of our manufacturing facilities during  which had a negative effect on our profit margins 
higher component costs during the first quarter of also had a negative effect on our profit margins 
as the economic business cycle deteriorated in  our product mix negatively affected our profit margin in the last half of the year 
selling  general and administrative expenses  although decreasing by approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year  amounted to approximately of sales for and of sales for the decrease in was due primarily to the reduction in the costs of support personnel and marketing personnel  which amounted to approximately  the company also recorded a charge of  in related to the forgiveness of stock option notes and related accrued interest as well as bonuses for certain officers and directors  all as a result of the sale of the company to simclar in june interest expense decreased approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year reflecting the decreased borrowings due to the reduction in trade receivables and inventories  along with declining interest rates during the year

significant reductions in sales of techdyne europe during recent years have resulted in continuing losses 
net losses for this subsidiary amounted to  for the year ended december   and  for the preceding year 
techdyne europe has continued its efforts at new business development  however  continuing losses have resulted in management s ongoing evaluation of the prospects for this facility 
approximately of our consolidated sales for were made to five customers 
customers generating at least of sales included itw  alcatel and trilithic 
the loss of  or substantially reduced sales to  any major customer would have an adverse effect on our operations if such sales were not replaced 
see item  business customers 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales amounted to for the year ended december   and for the preceding year 
we experienced increases in component costs during which had a negative effect on our profit margins  however  changes in product mix and a diversification of our customer base have offset this negative impact 
selling  general and administrative expenses  although increasing by approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year  amounted to approximately of sales for both periods 
the increase in included increases in the cost of support personnel and increased marketing costs associated with efforts to increase sales 
interest expense increased approximately  for the year ended december  compared to the preceding year reflecting the increased borrowings of lytton  a portion of which were utilized to fund the remaining  payment in july  on the lytton acquisition purchase price guarantee and increases relating to increased borrowings under our new credit facilities 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction of  for the year ended december   in interest on loans from medicore due to its conversion on september   of approximately  of a convertible note receivable from the company 
the prime rate was and at december  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents balance at december   was approximately  compared to approximately  at december  net cash provided by operating activities was approximately  in compared to approximately  in the increase in cash provided from operating activities was due primarily to the reduction in accounts receivable and inventories resulting from the sales volume decrease from the year to partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
at december   our average days sales outstanding was days as compared to days at december  the decrease of our average days sales outstanding is primarily the result of increased collection efforts and changes in customer base from average inventory turnover was and times for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in inventory turnover is primarily due to the increased frequency in customer order cancellations and for rescheduling to a later delivery date during compared to cash flows used in investing activities decreased approximately  in compared to approximately  used for investing activities in due primarily to the business downturn experienced in compared to  the company decreased its net acquisition of property and equipment in compared to the company has a capital expenditure budget of  for cash flow used in financing activities was approximately  compared to cash flow provided in of approximately  the cash flow was used to reduce the company s line of credit in see paragraph below regarding the company s new credit facility while the cash provided in was due primarily from an increase in line of credit 
on october   the company entered into two credit facilities with bank of scotland in edinburgh  scotland for an aggregate borrowing of  this new financing replaced the lines of credit and three commercial loans with the provident bank of ohio  for techdyne and lytton 
the new financing includes a line of credit  expiring may   with an interest rate at libor rate plus for a one  three or six month period  at the company s election 
the company elected the three month interest period at until january   and from this date until april  this line of credit had an outstanding balance of approximately  at december  the financing also includes a seven year term loan of  at the same interest rate as the line of credit 
the term loan requires quarterly payments of  starting on january  the term loan had an outstanding balance of approximately  at december  the company is of the opinion that the bank of scotland will renew the  line of credit until may  all of the assets of techdyne and lytton collateralize the credit facilities 
the credit facilities require affirmative and negative covenants 
certain of the affirmative covenants require maintenance of a consolidated adjusted net worth greater than  after december   a ratio of consolidated net trade receivables and net inventories to consolidated net borrowings not less than to  a ratio of consolidated trade receivable to consolidated net borrowings not less than 
to  and a ratio of consolidated net income before interest and income taxes to total consolidated interest costs not less than to some of the negative covenants  among others  include granting or permitting a security agreement against the consolidated assets of the companies other than permitted security agreements  declaring or paying any dividends or making any other payments on our capital stock  consolidating or merging with any other entity or acquiring or purchasing any equity interest in any other entity  or assuming any obligations of any other entity  except for notes and receivables acquired in the ordinary course of business  incurring  assuming  guarantying  or remaining liable with respect to any indebtedness  except for certain existing indebtedness disclosed in our financial statements  or undertaking any capital expenditure in excess of  in any one fiscal year 
the agreements also preclude changes in ownership in the companies  or any material change in any of our business objectives  purposes  operations and tax residence 
our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by changes in our business condition or results of our operations  or other events beyond our control 
the breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under our debt 
at december   we were in violation of the interest coverage covenant 
although the bank of scotland has waived this default  there can be no assurance that defaults in these or other covenants will not occur in the future  nor can there be any assurance that our lender will waive such future defaults 
a default in the covenants would permit our lender to accelerate the maturity of our credit facilities and sell the assets securing them  which would cause the company to cease operations and seek bankruptcy protection 
our indebtedness requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  which could reduce amounts for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the restrictions in our credit facility could also limit our flexibility in reacting to changes in our business and increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 
on october   techdyne europe entered into a credit facility with bank of scotland for an amount of pound  
this facility comprises an eight year term loan repayable in quarterly payments of pound   starting on january   with an interest rate of bank of scotland base rate plus effectively at december  
this line of credit had an outstanding balance of  at december  the proceeds from the credit facility were used to repay the year mortgage loan of  as of september  we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements with related or unrelated parties and no unconsolidated subsidiaries 
in the normal course of business  we enter into various contractual and other commercial commitments that impact or can impact the liquidity of our operations 
the following table outlines our commitments at december  total less than over in millions amounts year years years years long term debt      operating leases non cancelable  bank line of credit total contractual      unused bank line of credit   total commerical   due to the operating loss experienced by the company in the fourth quarter of  the company experienced an event of default as of december   relating to the interest coverage covenant 
the company received a wavier from the bank of scotland stating that it has no intention of placing the credit facility in default 
following its acquisition of a controlling interest in our company in june  simclar carried out a comprehensive review of various aspects of our business 
that review highlighted a number of areas where change was considered necessary to bring the company s operations and cost base more into line with the current order backlog and business climate 
the changes arising as a result of that review have now been implemented and the financial benefits of these are expected to have a positive effect on the company s financial performance in the forthcoming year 
such changes included the elimination of approximately employees and a reduction in associated annual costs of  additionally  the company on february  transferred all operating assets of techdyne europe to simclar 
techdyne europe incurred an operating loss of approximately  in the company s operating plans for the year reflect that the company will be in compliance with all the bank s financial covenants when tested in the company believes that the current levels of working capital and working capital generated from operations will be adequate to successfully meet its liquidity demands for next year

critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgements and estimates 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  the most significant of which include establishing allowances for doubtful accounts  allowances for inventory obsolescence  a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and determining the recoverability of our long lived assets 
the basis for our estimates are historical experience and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  given the available information at the time of the estimate  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  actual results may differ from the amounts estimated and recorded in such financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
based on historical information  we believe that our allowance is adequate 
however  changes in general economic  business and market conditions could affect the ability of our customers to make their required payments  therefore  the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed monthly and changes to the allowance are updated as new information is received 
allowance for inventory obsolescence 
we maintain an allowance for inventory obsolescence for losses resulting from inventory items becoming unusable in our manufacturing operations due to loss of a specific customers or a customers product changes or discontinuations 
based on historical and projected sales information and our concentration of customers  we believe that our allowance is adequate 
however  changes in general economic  business and market conditions could cause our customers to cancel  reduce or reschedule orders 
these changes could affect our inventory turn over  therefore  the allowance for inventory obsolescence is reviewed monthly and changes to the allowance are updated as new information is received 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
we had  deferred tax assets  including a  net operating loss carryforward benefit  in excess of deferred tax liabilities as of december  for financial reporting purposes we have recorded a valuation allowance of  due to the uncertainty of realizing these deferred tax assets 
long lived assets 
we state our property and equipment at acquisition cost and compute depreciation by the straight line method over estimated useful lives of the assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
a  write down on the carrying costs of the building and equipment of our discontinued scotland manufacturing facility was recorded in as further discussed under item  results of operations 
no other write downs are currently anticipated 
see also the related discussion under effect of recently issued accounting pronouncements above 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized upon delivery of a product based upon a customer s order where the selling price is fixed and collectability is reasonably assured 
related party transactions 
related party transactions as described in notes and in the consolidated financial statements appearing in part iv of this report  and are at terms no less favorable than would be received from third parties 
cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements this form k includes certain forward looking statements with respect to our company and its business that involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements are influenced by our financial position  business strategy  budgets  projected costs and the plans and objectives of management for future operations 
they use words such as anticipate  believe  plan  estimate  expect  intend  project and other similar expressions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
sensitivity of results of operations to interest rate risks on our investments is managed by conservatively investing liquid funds in short term government securities and interest bearing accounts at financial institutions in which we had approximately  invested at december  interest rate risks on debt are managed by negotiation of appropriate rates on new financing obligations based on current market rates 
there is an interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt agreements which totaled approximately  at december  we have exposure to both rising and falling interest rates 
a decrease in rates on our year end investments would result in a negative impact of approximately  on our results of operations 
a increase in rates on our year end variable rate debt would result in a negative impact of approximately  on our operations 
our exposure to market risks from foreign currency exchange rates relates to our european subsidiary whose results of operations when translated into us dollars are impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates 
a strengthening of the us dollar against the united kingdom currency  the pound  would have negatively impacted earnings by approximately  we have not incurred any significant realized losses on exchange transactions and have not utilized foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency fluctuations 
if realized losses on foreign transactions were to become significant  we would evaluate appropriate strategies  including the possible use of foreign exchange contracts  to reduce such losses
