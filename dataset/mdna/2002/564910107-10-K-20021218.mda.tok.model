industry background today s manufacturers face more challenges than ever 
economic constraints  such as labor and direct material costs  pressure from up stream manufacturers  increased customer demands  and faster delivery requirements are ongoing problems 
at the same time  manufacturers must be able to not only manage plant operations but also standardize processes  synchronize activities  provide cross operation visibility  comply with customer requirements  and monitor performance all across the organization 
manufacturers can improve their operations and competitiveness by addressing key business drivers such as reducing the time it takes to manufacture products  speeding time to market for new products

successful manufacturers require an efficient supply chain  distributed manufacturing resources  and improved methods of interacting with suppliers and customers 
growth  customer satisfaction  and profitability for these manufacturers all depend on an accurate and rapid flow of information within an integrated supply chain and extended enterprise systems linking suppliers  customers  and the manufacturer

these systems typically provide applications to support engineering data management  sales management  purchasing  inventory management  manufacturing control  distribution  transportation  finance  customer relationship management  and many other specialized business functions 
however  in order to compete more effectively most manufacturers also require systems that allow them to extend their enterprise throughout their external supply chain  linking operations with suppliers and customers

the systems may need to scale to accommodate expansion of the manufacturer s business through growth  acquisition  and organizational changes
