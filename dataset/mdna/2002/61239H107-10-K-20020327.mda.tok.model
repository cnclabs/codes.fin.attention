item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this annual report 
certain matters discussed or incorporated by reference in this annual report including  but not limited to  matters described in this item  are forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in such statements 
general the company s primary business is providing financial services to individuals and businesses 
the company is headquartered in watsonville  california  along the central coast 
the bank s history dates to the company pursues its business through conveniently located branch offices  where it attracts checking  money market  savings  and certificate of deposit accounts 
these deposits  and other available funds  are invested in a variety of loans and securities 
the vast majority of the company s loans at december  were secured by various types of real estate 
the bank s deposit gathering and lending markets are concentrated in the communities surrounding its eight full service branch offices located in santa cruz  northern monterey  and southern santa clara counties  in california 
the company also conducts its business by a variety of electronic means  including internet banking  telephone banking  and automated teller machine atm networks 
the most significant component of the company s revenue is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest and dividend income  primarily from loans  mortgage backed securities  and investment securities  and interest expense  primarily on deposits and borrowings 
the company s net interest income and net interest margin  which is defined as net interest income as a percent of average interest earning assets  are affected by its asset growth and quality  its asset and liability composition  and the general interest rate environment 
the company s service charges on deposits  mortgage loan servicing fees  and commissions from the sale of non fdic insured insurance products and investments through portola also have significant effects on the company s results of operations 
an additional major factor in determining the company s results of operations are non interest expenses  which consist primarily of employee compensation  occupancy and equipment expenses  data and item processing fees  and other operating expenses 
the company s results of operations are also significantly affected by the level of provisions for loan losses and general economic and competitive conditions  particularly absolute and relative levels and changes in market interest rates  government policies  and actions of regulatory agencies 
as discussed under item business company strategy  the company is in the process of transforming itself from a savings loan association that was historically focused upon funding residential mortgage loans with certificates of deposit into a community based commercial bank offering a far wider scope of financial services to individuals and businesses 
this transformation is being undertaken to enhance stockholder value while at the same time better meeting the financial needs of the individuals  families  professionals  and businesses in the greater monterey bay area of central california 
this transformation presents significant execution risk  as the strategic profile being pursued by the company requires much greater human and technological resources to accomplish than the company s historical operations 
in addition  community commercial banking is by nature a higher risk activity than traditional savings loan business  with increased credit and operational risks  among other risk factors 
activities not conducted by the company at december   the company did not have o foreign currency risk  as all of the company s operations are conducted in us dollars o interest rate swap  cap  floor  or collar agreements  or other freestanding or embedded derivatives o off balance sheet activity other than normal commitments to fund loans and lines of credit o special purpose entities o debt securities convertible into equity in conjunction with its interest rate risk management program  the company may  however  in the future enter into interest rate swap  cap  floor  collar  or similar arrangements 
in addition  the company may pursue different types and sources of capital in the future to support its growth  including trust preferred securities or convertible securities 
primary risks experienced by the company the greatest single source of risk to the company is credit risk 
credit risk is the financial exposure to borrowers not repaying the loans extended by the company 
other significant risks experienced by the company are interest rate risk and operational risk 
interest rate risk is the financial exposure resulting from changes in nominal and relative interest rates  as more fully discussed under item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk 
operational risk results from the company s funds transfer and related activities  whereby the company could experience loss if funds were inappropriately transferred and not recovered 
the company maintains extensive policies and procedures and certain insurance policies designed to mitigate these primary risks 
however  no set of practices can eliminate every potential current and future source of these risks 
in addition  the company creates economic value and earns income in part through the effective management  but not elimination  of these primary risks 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the company s significant accounting policies are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements  which are included in this annual report 
the company follows accounting policies typical to the community commercial banking industry and in compliance with various regulations and guidelines as established by the financial accounting standards board fasb and the bank s primary federal regulator  the ots 
the company s most significant management accounting estimate is the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses 
as discussed under item business credit quality allowance for loan losses  the company follows a methodology for calculating the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses 
however  various factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company  could lead to significant revisions in the amount of allowance for loan losses in future periods  with a corresponding impact upon the results of operations 
in addition  the calculation of the allowance for loan losses is by nature inexact  as the allowance represents management s best estimate of the loan losses inherent in the company s credit portfolios at the reporting date 
these loan losses will occur in the future  and as such cannot be determined with absolute certainty at the reporting date 
other estimates that the company utilizes in its accounting include the expected useful lives of depreciable assets  such as buildings  building improvements  equipment  and furniture 
the useful lives of various technology related hardware and software can be subject to change due to advances in technology and the general adoption of new standards for technology or interfaces among computer or telecommunication systems 
the company applies accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and related interpretations in accounting for stock options 
under apb no 
 compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair market value of the company s stock at the date of grant over the amount the employee or director must pay to acquire the stock 
because the company s stock option plans provide for the issuance of options at a price of no less than the fair market value at the date of grant  no compensation cost is required to be recognized for the stock option plans 
had compensation costs for the stock option plans been determined based upon the fair value at the date of grant consistent with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  the company s net income and earnings per share would have been reduced as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  based upon the assumptions listed therein 
gaap itself may change over time  impacting the reporting of the company s financial activity 
although the economic substance of the company s transactions would not change  alterations in gaap could affect the timing or manner of accounting or reporting 
interest rate environment the table below presents an overview of the interest rate environment during the two years ended december  during the first half of  the federal reserve continued the series of interest rate increases it commenced in mid  with the final rate increase implemented in may these increases were implemented by the federal reserve in response to strong economic growth and tight labor markets  among other factors 
the federal reserve did not adjust its benchmark interest rates including the target rate for overnight federal funds again until january in january  the federal reserve commenced what would become a historically large and rapid decrease in interest rates  as the economy slowed and eventually fell into recession 
during  the federal reserve cut interest rates a total of times for an aggregate decrease of basis points 
by the end of  short term interest rates were at low nominal levels that had not been seen for decades 
while the federal reserve took no formal rate adjustment action between june and december  the capital markets did reflect the changing economic environment 
many capital markets interest rates  such as the london interbank offer rate libor curve  peaked about may   and then commenced a gradual decline throughout the remainder of the year 
for example  the one year libor rate at may  was  declining to by december  the treasury yield curve shifted from a more traditional positively sloped curve at the beginning of to significantly negatively sloped curve by the end of the year 
inverted yield curves often present challenges to financial institutions  as short term funding rates can be higher than longer term investment rates 
by mid  the treasury yield curve had returned to its more traditional positive slope 
by the end of  the treasury yield was the steepest in the past two years  with a basis point differential between the three month and ten year treasury instruments 
steep  positively sloped yield curves are generally favorable for financial institutions  including the company  as near term cash flows from intermediate to longer term higher yielding assets can be funded at comparatively low interest rates 
the past two years thus represented a period of substantial interest rate volatility  with significant changes in the nominal and relative levels of interest rates 
this magnitude of interest rate volatility presents additional challenges to financial institutions  including the company  in managing cash flows and interest rate risk exposure 
the th district cost of funds index cofi and the mta index mta the month cumulative average of the year treasury constant maturities index or year cmt are by nature lagging indices that trail changes in more responsive interest rate indices such as those associated with the spot treasury or libor markets 
index rate month treasury bill month treasury bill year treasury note year treasury note year treasury note target federal funds prime rate month libor month libor year cmt mta cofi indices rates are spot values unless otherwise noted 
these indices rates are monthly averages 
business strategy the company s overall business objective is to maximize stockholder value 
the company s directors and management believe that the best approach to achieving that key objective is to continue the company s strategic transformation from a traditional savings loan into a community commercial bank offering a broader range of financial services  products  and solutions to individuals and businesses in california 
the company s directors and management also believe that following a relationship focused approach to helping customers attain their financial goals progresses the company toward its key strategic objective while also improving the quality of life in the communities served by the company and making the company a desirable employer 
the company s business strategy thus integrates advancing the interests of its three key constituencies stockholders  local communities  and employees 
specific elements of the company s business strategy include o increasing the ratio of loans to assets as a means of enhancing net interest income  serving more customers  moderating exposure to changes in interest rates  and better utilizing the company s capital resources 
o diversifying the product mix within the loan portfolio to reduce the high concentration in residential mortgages while also meeting the financing needs of consumers and businesses within the company s market areas 
o enhancing the delivery of relationship banking  where the company s employees invest time and resources in thoroughly understanding their customers and thereby provide a comprehensive financial services solution 
o expanding services for businesses  including improved deposit courier service  internet business banking  funds sweep  and cash management products 
o acquiring customers disaffected by the acquisition of their financial services provider or branch office 
o capitalizing on the company s position as one of the largest independent financial institutions in the greater monterey bay area and on the bank s year history 
o bolstering non interest income as a percent of total revenues  with such non interest income sourced from an expanding list of fee based products and services  including atm surcharges  deposit account and branch service charges  and sales of non fdic insured investment products including mutual funds and annuities 
o changing the company s deposit mix to emphasize transaction accounts as a means of cementing customer relationships  lowering the company s relative cost of funds  generating fee income  and increasing the duration of the company s funding 
o capitalizing on business opportunities unique to the company s primary service areas  for example  installing remote atm s at highly trafficked tourist attractions 
o pursuing alternative forms of delivery and new technologies for financial products and services as a means of attracting a greater volume of business while also improving the company s efficiency ratio 
o adding additional branch or loan production office facilities to better and more completely serve the company s key market areas 
o increasing the company s visibility in and contributions to its local communities through the donation of equipment  funds  and employee time to a wide range of organizations committed to improving the quality of life in the greater monterey bay area 
for additional information regarding the company s strategy  please see item business company strategy 
the company intends to continue pursuing this business strategy in  with specific goals of adding a southern california loan production office opened in february   seeking sites for a de novo retail branch or opportunities for the acquisition of existing bank branches  expanding the commercial banking group  increasing customer use of internet banking and electronic bill payment  pursuing additional remote atm sites  implementing new technologies complementary to the new core data processing system installed in  and effectively managing the company s strong capital position 
however  there can be no assurance that any such steps will be implemented  or if implemented  whether such steps will improve the company s financial performance 
analysis of results of operations for the years ended december  and december  overview for the year ended december   net income was million  equivalent to basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share 
this compares to net income of million  or basic and diluted earnings per share  for the year the million in net income was the highest annual level in the company s history 
return on average stockholders equity increased from in to in return on average assets increased from in to in the company s financial performance increased sequentially from the first quarter of through to the fourth quarter  which represented the highest quarterly earnings in the company s history 
the continued implementation of the company s strategic plan was a primary factor in the company s improved financial performance in versus other factors included a more favorable credit experience in versus  and better results on the sale of securities 
net interest income net interest income increased from million in to million in due to both expanded spreads and greater average balances of interest earnings assets 
the company s ratio of net interest income to average total assets increased from in to in despite the company s difficulty in decreasing now and savings deposit rates at the same pace as the declines in indices used for adjustable rate loans 
the company s now and savings deposit rates were already at low nominal levels before the significant interest rate cuts totaling basis points implemented by the federal reserve throughout the company moderated the impact of these factors in through its proactive asset liability management program and a shift in balance sheet composition 
the company s ratio of net interest income to average total assets rose to during the fourth quarter of  as the new commercial banking customers attracted during commenced having a more significant  positive impact upon the company s spreads 
the expansion in the company s net interest margin on average interest earning assets from in to in to in constitutes a key trend in the company s financial performance 
this trend has resulted from the actions taken by the company coincident with its strategic plan 
the million  or  increase in net interest income generated in versus primarily resulted from four factors change in asset mix average net loans receivable increased from of average total assets in to of average total assets in lower yielding cash equivalents  investment securities  and mortgage backed securities all declined as a percentage of average total assets in versus the benefits from this shift in asset mix were significant  as the average rate earned on net loans receivable in was  substantially above the earned on cash equivalents  earned on investment securities  and earned on mortgage backed securities 
change in liability mix average transaction deposit accounts dda  now  savings  and money market combined as a percentage of average total deposits rose from in to in transaction deposit accounts present a lower cost of funding than most alternative sources 
non interest bearing demand deposit accounts dda rose from of average total deposits in to in the company has targeted increased dda balances  particularly from business customers  as an important component of its business strategy 
increased average balance sheet average total assets increased by from to the larger average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  combined with expanding spreads  contributed toward greater nominal net interest income 
asset liability management net interest income in benefited from positions taken by the company as a result of its asset liability management program  as more fully discussed under item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk 
early in  the company moderately increased the net liability sensitivity of the balance sheet in order to benefit from the rapid and significant interest rate cuts being implemented by the federal reserve 
this was accomplished  in part  by adding intermediate term  fixed rate assets during the first half of the year  primarily in the form of residential hybrid mortgages 
net interest income was also benefited in versus by an increase in average stockholders equity  which was substantially offset by an increase in average non interest earning assets  primarily deferred tax assets 
as presented in note to the consolidated financial statements  net deferred tax assets increased in primarily due to the rise in the company allowance for loan losses and because of the differential between book and tax amortization periods for core deposit intangibles 
in conjunction with its business strategy  the company plans to expand net interest income in future periods by o continuing to increase the percentage of its assets allocated to loans o shifting the loan mix toward higher yielding types of loans and away from comparatively lower yielding residential mortgages o raising the percentage of its total deposits represented by transaction accounts and decreasing the percentage of total deposits represented by certificates of deposit o increasing the volume of interest earning assets o continuing to proactively manage the company s exposure to changes in the nominal and relative levels of general market interest rates average balances  average rates  and net interest margin the following table presents the average amounts outstanding for the major categories of the company s assets and liabilities  the average rate earned upon each major category of interest earning assets  the average rate paid for each major category of interest bearing liabilities  and the resulting net interest spread  net interest margin  and average interest margin on total assets for the years indicated

interest rate spread represents the difference between the average rate on interest earning assets and the average rate on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin equals net interest income before provision for estimated loan losses divided by average interest earning assets 
rate volume analysis the most significant impact on the company s net interest income between periods is derived from the interaction of changes in the volumes of and rates earned or paid on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table utilizes the figures from the preceding table to present a comparison of interest income and interest expense resulting from changes in the volumes and the rates on average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities for the years indicated 
changes in interest income or interest expense attributable to volume changes are calculated by multiplying the change in volume by the prior year average interest rate 
the changes in interest income or interest expense attributable to interest rate changes are calculated by multiplying the change in interest rate by the prior year average volume 
the changes in interest income or interest expense attributable to the combined impact of changes in volume and changes in interest rate are calculated by multiplying the change in rate by the change in volume

this increase resulted from the effects of greater average balances of interest earning assets and a shift in the earning asset mix more than offsetting the impact of a lower interest rate environment in versus interest income on loans increased from million in to million in  as the effect of greater average balances more than offset a decline in average rate from in to in because the vast majority of the company s loans are either adjustable rate or fixed rate for a limited period of time and then adjustable rate  the declining interest rate environment prevalent throughout reduced the company s yield on its loan portfolio 
the drop in this yield was  however  moderated by periodic caps and lifetime floors on certain loan products 
interest income on mortgage backed securities declined from million in to million in due to both lower average balances and reduced average rates 
the reduction in average balances was intentional  as the company used scheduled principal payments  principal prepayments  and sales of mortgage backed securities to support the expansion in the loan portfolio and achieve the targeted shift in asset mix 
the decline in average rates was caused by o a shift in the mix of mortgage backed securities away from long term  fixed rate pass though certificates to lower duration collateralized mortgage obligations and adjustable rate pass through certificates in conjunction with the company s asset liability management program o a shift in the mix of collateralized mortgage obligations away from non agency issued securities toward agency issued securities in order to obtain greater liquidity and to increase the amount of securities eligible for use a collateral for various types of deposits o the general decline in interest rates  as adjustable rate mortgage backed securities repriced downwards and as new security purchases during generally had lower effective rates than the securities in the portfolio at the end of please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding mortgage backed securities 
interest income on investment securities decreased from thousand in to thousand in this decline was due to lower average balances and lower average rates 
because all of the company s investment securities in and were variable rate corporate trust preferred securities that adjust quarterly based upon the month libor index  these securities repriced downwards rapidly in in conjunction with the interest rate cuts implemented by the federal reserve 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding investment securities 
interest income on cash equivalents declined from thousand in to thousand in due to both lower average balances and lower average rates 
an objective of the company is to minimize its cash cash equivalent position  subject to ensuring the maintenance of sufficient liquidity  in order to allocate investable funds toward higher yielding types of assets 
because cash equivalents are of limited term  they repriced downward quickly in dividend income on fhlb stock decreased from thousand in to thousand in due to lower effective rates 
the lower effective rates were due to the lower interest rate environment in versus and due to the fhlb sf s decision to pay particularly high dividend rates during the first half of in conjunction with its capital management program 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million  representing a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
this decrease resulted from the change in the mix of interest bearing liabilities and the effect of lower average rates more than offsetting the impact of greater average balances of interest bearing liabilities 
interest expense on interest bearing deposits decreased from million in to million in  as the change in composition and the effect of lower effective rates more than offset the impact of greater average balances 
the increased average balances were in conformity with the company s strategic plan of increasing market share in its local communities and better meeting the savings  funds management  and investment needs of individuals and businesses in the greater monterey bay area 
the lower average rates in versus resulted from the lower interest rate environment and a shift in deposit mix away from relatively higher cost certificates of deposit toward relatively lower cost transaction accounts 
certificates of deposit constituted of average total deposits in  compared to the prior year 
the weighted average cost of interest bearing deposits declined from in to in a rise in attractively priced funds in conjunction with the state of california time deposit program also contributed to the decrease in average deposit costs in interest expense on borrowings was nearly constant in and  as the effect of an increase in average balances was offset by the impact of lower average rates 
while the company has access to various types of borrowings  most borrowings in were concentrated in fhlb advances 
the various credit programs from the fhlb sf provide the company with the opportunity to undertake specific borrowings designed to meet current and projected funding needs while also facilitating the asset liability management program 
the average effective rate on borrowings other than fhlb advances was inflated in and by the amortization of the commitment fee associated with mbbc s line of credit from a correspondent bank 
provision for loan losses implicit in lending activities is the risk that losses will occur and that the amount of such losses will vary over time 
consequently  the company maintains an allowance for loan losses by charging a provision to operations 
loans determined to be losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered by management  at a point in time and with then available information  to be adequate to provide for estimable and probable losses inherent in the existing portfolio 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management estimates the amount of probable loss for each individual loan that has been identified as having greater than standard credit risk  including loans identified as criticized special mention  classified substandard or lower graded  impaired  troubled debt restructured  and non performing 
in determining specific and formula loss estimates  management incorporates such factors as collateral value  portfolio composition and concentration  trends in local and national economic and real estate conditions  the duration of the current business cycle  seasoning of the loan portfolio  historical credit experience  and the financial status of borrowers 
while the overall allowance is segmented by broad portfolio categories to analyze its adequacy  the allowance is general in nature and is available for the loan portfolio in its entirety 
although management believes that the allowance is adequate  future provisions are subject to continuing evaluation of inherent risk in the loan portfolio  as conducted by both management and the bank s regulators 
provisions for loan losses declined from million in to million in the change in provisions was due to the result of the company s methodology for calculating the level of allowance for loan losses 
factors that contributed to the reduction in provisions in versus the prior year included o a lower level of net charge offs in versus o a decrease in the amount of classified loans at december  versus the prior year end o a reduced concentration of relatively higher risk construction and land loans in versus o the reduction in specific reserves of thousand associated with a commercial real estate construction loan that was collected in full during the second quarter of o an increased concentration of relatively lower risk residential and multifamily mortgages in versus the above factors more than offset the impact of a larger loan portfolio  including growth in commercial business loans outstanding  which increased from million at december  to million at december  the above factors also more than offset higher reserve factors for the company s portfolios of hotel motel real estate loans and business express loans see item business credit quality 
to the extent that the company is successful in its business strategy and thereby continues building the size of its loan portfolio while also extending increased volumes of construction  income property  and business lending  management anticipates that additional provisions will be required and charged against operations in  with the ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans receivable increasing to reflect the greater credit exposure inherent in the loan mix 
non interest income non interest income totaled million in  comparing favorably to million in the company recorded thousand in pre tax gains on security sales in  versus a pre tax loss of thousand during as discussed below  customer service charges and mortgage banking income also increased in versus the prior year  offset by reduced loan servicing income and decreased commissions from sales of non fdic insured investments 
service charge income rose from million during to million during this increase primarily resulted from the revised fee and service charge schedule implemented with the new core processing system in loan servicing income totaled thousand during  compared to thousand during the company continues to sell the vast majority of its long term  fixed rate residential loan production into the secondary market on a servicing released basis 
as a result  the portfolio of loans serviced for others is declining as loans pay off 
at december   the company serviced million in various types of loans for other investors  compared to million at december  commissions from sale of non fdic insured investments totaled thousand during  compared to thousand during less favorable general capital market conditions  the events of september   and investment staff turnover and vacancies contributed to the lower revenues in versus during early  the company continued to be challenged in recruiting licensed investment sales representatives 
gains on the sale of loans increased from thousand during to thousand during the lower general interest rate environment in led to a strong residential loan refinance market  which in turn bolstered the company s mortgage banking activity 
in  the company implemented new technology designed to speed the processing  funding  and delivery into the secondary market of fixed rate residential mortgages  thus lower operating costs and providing enhanced customer service 
further augmenting non interest income  both nominally and a percentage of total revenue  constitutes a primary component of the company s business strategy 
in  the company plans to enhance its fee income by continuing to market electronic bill payment and debit card services  increasing the number of transaction deposit accounts  and selling depository and cash management services to business customers who would be charged via account analysis 
non interest expense non interest expense rose million  or  from million in to million in total non interest expense in was increased by costs for the march data processing conversion thousand and legal and other expenses associated with the arbitration of claims by a former executive thousand 
total non interest expenses in included thousand in costs for the data processing conversion and thousand accrued for settlement of the claims by the former executive 
costs for the data processing conversion included de conversion fees to the prior service bureau  printing and postage costs for additional customer communications  employee training and travel costs  and consulting fees for technology professionals retained to assist with and speed the implementation of the new system 
throughout  the company adjusted its staffing to advance the strategic plan  primarily through the hiring of commercial loan officers and professional bankers 
staffing was also increased in the data processing function  coincident with the company s shifting from an external service bureau to in house data processing 
the change in the company s systems environment also impacted various other operating expenses 
data processing fees were much lower in versus  while equipment expense was higher due to the added depreciation from the new hardware and software installed in compensation and employee benefit costs also increased in versus for payments under certain incentive compensation plans 
these expenses rose in in conjunction with the company s improved financial performance 
costs for the bank s employee stock ownership plan esop increased in versus because of the higher average price of monterey bay bancorp  inc common stock 
advertising and promotion costs during were thousand  down from thousand in primarily due to the company s reducing certain marketing efforts early in while the core processing conversion was being completed 
advertising during included local radio ads that focused on attracting business customers through the communication of the bank s relationship banking approach to customer service 
the bank also continued to promote its theme of monterey bay bank 
expect more 
get the best 
while the company s efficiency ratio improved from in to in  management acknowledges that this ratio remains above levels produced by higher performing peer companies 
this ratio has been unfavorably impacted during the past two years by the up front operating costs and other expenses that the company has incurred in advance of associated revenues as the company has implemented its strategic plan 
the company has made investments in new staff and new systems that are necessary to successfully market a broader range of financial products to a greater segment of individuals and businesses in its primary market areas 
these investments by nature had to precede the associated revenues 
by the fourth quarter of  the financial benefits of these investments became more prominent  as the efficiency ratio during the fourth quarter of declined to 
the company plans to continue making investments to support its strategic plan in  in particular  the hiring of additional business relationship officers  real estate loan originators  and professional bankers 
however  these investments are likely to be of lesser relative magnitude that those conducted in and in addition  management has commenced a series of initiatives designed to both improve customer service and satisfaction while also improving profitability 
these initiatives  planned for implementation in  include o increasing emphasis on variable  performance based compensation  with measurement criteria directly related to financial contribution  economic value created  customer retention  and new customer development o implementing technology complementary to the new core processing system installed in to improve productivity and enhance customer service o using new technology to foster the re allocation of employee time and costs from operational or administrative functions toward revenue generation and customer service however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in implementing the above initiatives or that the company s will be able to improve its profitability or efficiency ratio 
stock based compensation in  the company extensively utilized stock based compensation for directors  officers  and a significant number of non officer employees 
the company believes that the use of stock based compensation aligns director  officer  and employee interests with those of stockholders 
the company s stock based compensation programs are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
several of the company s stock based compensation programs provide for vesting periods of up to five years  thereby also encouraging management and employees to work in the best long term interests of the company and its stockholders 
director retainer fees during were paid in company common stock 
in addition  a number of the bank s officers voluntarily accepted company common stock in lieu of certain cash compensation during these decisions included the election by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer to each receive a significant component of his incentive compensation in company common stock 
the company intends to continue extensively utilizing stock based compensation and incentives in  including the issuance of additional stock options  as approved by stockholders  at of the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant 
this compares to the ratio generally prevalent among similar financial institution holding companies 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased from million in to million in due to a rise in pre tax income 
the company s effective book tax rate decreased slightly in versus the prior year 
the company s effective book tax rate in recent years has been above the statutory rate due to the fair market value adjustment arising from the esop 
the company recognizes operating expense for the esop based upon fair market value at the date shares are committed to be released 
the differential between fair market value and the company s historical basis in the esop shares committed to be released comprises the fair market value adjustment that is added to pre tax income in determining the company s provision for income taxes 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets of the company were million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million  or 
cash cash equivalents decreased from million at december  to million at december  due to the company s using cash equivalents to fund an expansion in the loan portfolio 
investment securities at december  and were composed of the same two variable rate corporate trust preferred securities issued by major us banks that reprice quarterly based upon a margin over the month libor rate 
these two securities were rated a or better by standards poors rating agency at december  management may consider selling these two securities in to bolster the bank s qtl ratio  shift funds into assets that function as more effective collateral under secured borrowing arrangements  and provide funds for further expansion in loans receivable 
increasing the qtl ratio would provide additional time before the bank would be forced by regulation to allocate the management time and incur the operating expense associated with a change in charter from a federal thrift to either a california state or national commercial bank 
for additional information regarding investment securities  please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
mortgage backed securities decreased from million at december  to million at december  during  the company utilized cash flows from sales and principal payments on mortgage related securities to fund an increase in the loan portfolio 
all of the company s mortgage backed securities at december  were rated aaa by at least one nationally recognized ratings agency 
as highlighted in note to the consolidated financial statements  during  the company also continued altering the mix of its mortgage backed securities 
long term  fixed rate pass through securities were decreased  while variable rate and balloon mortgage backed securities were increased 
cmo s were shifted to higher cash flow  shorter term securities with less extension risk 
these instruments provide more periodic funds that can be used to support further expansion in net loans receivable 
these changes were conducted in conjunction with the company s asset liability and liquidity management programs 
in  management reallocated some of the company s capacity for longer term  fixed rate assets from the security portfolio to the loan portfolio  where better yields were available for the same level of interest rate risk 
the company also shifted the mix in cmo issuers in toward agency issuance and away from private label  aaa rated securities 
this alteration in mix was conducted to provide additional eligible collateral for various types of deposits  including time deposits placed by the state of california 
in  the company plans to continue emphasizing the use of cmo s in its mortgage backed security portfolio  as the company can use certain cmo s eg planned amortization classes  or pac s to target future cash flows in conjunction with its asset liability  liquidity  and balance sheet management programs 
the company does  however  plan to purchase additional longer term  fixed rate mortgage backed securities in as part of its proactive efforts to increase investment in low to moderate income housing 
loans held for sale  carried at the lower of cost or market  totaled thousand at december  the company sells most of its long term  fixed rate residential mortgage production into the secondary market on a servicing released basis  and purchases more interest rate sensitive loans as part of its interest rate risk management program 
loans held for investment  net  increased from million at december  to a record million at december  the increase resulted from a combination of strong internal loan originations and from pool purchases of various types of california real estate loans 
net loans as a percentage of total assets increased from at december  to at december   in conjunction with the company s strategy of supporting its interest margin  fostering economic activity in its local communities  and effectively utilizing the bank s capital 
management has targeted increasing the net loan to asset ratio to in should market conditions prove favorable 
in conjunction with its strategic plan  the company intends to pursue both an expansion in net loans receivable in and a shift in loan mix away from residential mortgages toward income property  construction  and business lending 
the establishment of the los angeles loan production office in the first quarter of is expected to advance that change in mix  as that office will focus on construction and income property lending 
while just of gross loans outstanding at december   the company s commercial business lending gained momentum during the fourth quarter of  ending the year with a record loan pipeline 
the new commercial banking relationship officers hired during had a positive impact in the fourth quarter of the year  generating a rise in deposit balances in addition to the expansion in the business loan portfolio 
the company s investment in the capital stock of the fhlb increased from million at december  to million at december  stock dividends and capital stock purchases during were partially offset by a mandatory capital stock redemption 
the company s balance of premises and equipment  net  increased by thousand in primarily due to hardware and software purchased in support of the new core processing system 
premises and equipment balances may increase more substantially in if the company is successful in acquiring or opening de novo one or more new branch locations 
for additional information regarding premises and equipment  please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company continued to amortize its core deposit intangibles during  reducing their balance from million at december  to million at december  this amortization  which is a non cash charge to operations  bolsters the bank s regulatory capital ratios all else held constant  as intangible assets are deducted from gaap capital in determining regulatory capital 
this amortization also increases the company s tangible book value per share 
for additional information regarding core deposit intangibles  please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company maintained thousand in originated mortgage servicing rights  down from thousand a year earlier 
because the company has adopted a program of generally selling its loans on a servicing released basis  management anticipates that the balance of originated mortgage servicing rights will continue to decline as the existing portfolio of loans serviced for others pays off 
total liabilities rose from million at december  to million at december  this million increase was approximately split between an increase in deposits and an increase in borrowings 
accounts payable and other liabilities decreased by million during primarily due to the timing of interest payments on borrowings  a reduction in accrued liabilities for deferred compensation and non qualified retirement plans  and the settlement of claims by a former executive which had been accrued at december  in  the company intends to pursue the conclusion of all non qualified retirement plans through the negotiation of lump sum payments 
such conclusion accelerates tax deductions for the company  saves a minor amount of administrative overhead  and reduces other liabilities 
this conclusion is expected to have only a minor  if any  impact on the results of operations 
deposits increased from million at december  to a record million at december  the company experienced strong growth in money market deposits during due to a combination of sales and marketing focus and the historically low interest rate environment s leading certain customers to delay committing funds to term certificates of deposit 
deposit growth during was  however  restrained by a small number of very large competitors that conducted aggressive promotional campaigns based on paying interest rates significantly above levels offered by most money center  regional  and california community banks 
deposit growth during was also restrained by customer response to the new systems environment  as the company eliminated passbooks in favor of statement accounts and as certain deposit products were repriced upwards to reflect competitive market conditions or the company s costs of providing the accounts 
the company continues to focus on attracting new transaction deposit accounts in conjunction with its strategic plan  with the additional objective of continuing to reduce the percentage of the deposit mix represented by relatively higher cost certificates of deposit 
certificates of deposit declined from of total deposits at december  to of total deposits at december   despite a million increase in funds from the state of california time deposit program 
for additional information regarding deposits  please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
fhlb advances increased from million at december  to million at december  during  the company utilized fhlb advances to fund some of the expansion in the loan portfolio 
all of the company s fhlb advances at december  were fixed rate  fixed term borrowings without call or put option features 
during the fourth quarter of  the company prepaid million in fhlb advances due in the first quarter of in order to extend the term structure of that debt in conjunction with the company s asset liability management program 
despite the company s strong capital position in  management did not pursue extensive leveraging via wholesale assets and liabilities  such as fhlb advances 
management believes the company s capital is better deployed in meeting the financial needs of individuals  families  and businesses  and that much lesser economic value is created by engaging in wholesale leveraging strategies 
consolidated stockholders equity increased from million at december  to million at december  due to a combination of o net income o continued amortization of deferred stock compensation o directors receiving their fees in company stock o appreciation in the portfolio of securities classified as available for sale  recorded in other comprehensive income o the exercise of vested stock options the company did not declare or pay any cash dividends in in  the company announced the indefinite suspension of the declaration and payment of cash dividends 
the board of directors believes that  at this time  the company s capital is better utilized in growing the balance sheet  expanding the bank s franchise value  and repurchasing shares versus paying a cash dividend 
in addition  paying a nominal cash dividend would cause the company to incur additional operating costs for processing  mailing  and tax information reporting 
the company has no current plans to commence paying cash dividends in the company did not conduct any share repurchases during however  as previously announced during the fourth quarter of  the company s board of directors has authorized a  share stock repurchase program commencing in december the company s tangible book value per share increased from at december  to at december  the company s tangible book value per share benefits from the amortization of deferred stock compensation and core deposit intangibles  in addition to periodic earnings and other factors that add to stockholders equity without increasing the number of shares outstanding 
analysis of results of operations for the years ended december  and december  overview the company reported net income of million for the year ended december   down from net income of million for the prior year 
these amounts translate to basic and diluted earnings per share in  compared to basic and diluted earnings per share in the company s return on average assets decreased from in to in the company s average return on equity also fell  from in to in the overall reduction in net income during resulted from a number of factors  including a higher provision for loan losses  greater operating expenses  and less favorable results from the sale of securities 
these factors more than offset increases in net interest income and most sources of non interest income other than results from the sale of securities 
net interest income during the years ended december  and  net interest income before the provision for loan losses was million and million  respectively 
the level of average interest earning assets over the same years was million and million  respectively 
the net interest spread was and  respectively  for the years ended december  and during these same periods  the ratio of net interest income to average total assets was and  respectively 
the million  or  increase in net interest income generated in versus the prior year was primarily produced by three key changes in the company s balance sheet composition on the asset side of the balance sheet  the company redirected its earning asset mix towards loans receivable  reducing the proportion of earning assets comprised of relatively lower yielding cash equivalents  investment securities  and mortgage backed securities 
loans receivable  net  increased from of average interest earning assets in to of average interest earning assets in loans receivable  net  earned a weighted average rate of during  comparing favorably to on cash equivalents  on investment securities  and on mortgage backed securities 
on the liability side of the balance sheet  the company increased the percentage of average interest bearing liabilities composed of transaction deposit accounts now  savings  and money market from in to in transaction deposit accounts present a relatively lower cost of funding than most alternative sources 
the proportional increase in average transaction accounts was offset by a decline in the percentage of average interest bearing liabilities represented by certificates of deposit 
certificates of deposit represented of average interest bearing liabilities in  versus the prior year 
the company increased its average balance of interest earning assets by million  or  in versus due to the deposit growth the company achieved during  this rise in average interest earning assets was accomplished with only a slight increase in the proportion of funding provided by comparatively higher cost borrowings 
borrowings as a percentage of average interest bearing liabilities increased from in to in the company s larger average balance sheet in versus contributed to the million rise in net interest income 
average non interest bearing liabilities increased from million during to million during increases in average non interest bearing liabilities  which primarily consist of demand deposit accounts  favorably impact the company s net interest income 
interest income interest income for the year ended december  totaled million  an increase of million from the prior year 
the increase resulted from a shift in asset mix toward higher yielding assets  the generally higher interest rate environment in versus  a decision by the fhlb sf to pay particularly high dividend rates during the first half of in conjunction with its capital management program  and a larger average balance of interest earning assets 
the larger average balance of interest earning assets stemmed from the company s desire to effectively utilize the bank s regulatory capital and liquidity in building the size of the loan portfolio 
the weighted average yield on interest earning assets increased from during to during the yield on the company s assets generally benefits from a higher interest rate environment  as the vast majority of the company s assets are either adjustable rate or fixed rate with limited duration 
interest income on loans increased from million in to million in this rise was due to a greater average balance of loans outstanding and higher average rates 
the higher average rates stemmed from both the higher general interest rate environment and the shift in loan mix away from relatively lower yielding residential mortgages and toward generally higher yielding multifamily and commercial real estate loans 
interest income on mortgage backed securities decreased from million in to million in  as the impact of lower average balances more than offset the effect of higher average rates 
a similar pattern applied to interest income on investment securities  which decreased from thousand in to thousand in the average rate on the company s investments in corporate trust preferred securities rose relatively rapidly during due to their repricing quarterly based on the responsive three month libor index 
the increase in rate was  however  insufficient to offset the impact of lower average volumes resulting from the sale of corporate trust securities with a face value of million during interest income on cash equivalents rose during  as a greater average balance was complemented by higher average rates resulting from the increases in the target federal funds rate implemented by the federal reserve 
the company maintained a higher average balance of cash equivalents during primarily due to the periodic build up of excess liquidity in support of pending loan originations and purchases 
in addition  during  the company placed thousand in short term certificates of deposit with minority focused financial institutions in conjunction with its proactive program under the community reinvestment act 
interest expense interest expense on deposits increased from million during to million during due to a combination of greater average balances and higher average rates 
the greater average balances stemmed from the company s deposit marketing initiatives throughout the year to attract more consumer and business deposit accounts 
the average rate paid on deposits during increased from the prior year  despite a favorable shift in deposit mix  due to the higher general interest rate environment 
the average cost of interest bearing deposits rose from during to during interest expense on borrowings increased from million during to million during higher average volumes and greater average rates each contributed to the rise in interest expense 
the company primarily used fhlb advances as a source of borrowings during  with mbbc far less active in selling securities under agreements to repurchase during versus prior years due to the sale of mbbc s security portfolio in early provision for loan losses provision for loan losses increased from thousand during to million during this increase resulted from the following factors the growth in the size of the loan portfolio during net charge offs of thousand in versus thousand in the continued shift in loan mix away from residential mortgages and toward income property loans  which typically present more credit risk than residential mortgages 
specific reserves rose from thousand at december  to thousand at december  the thousand specific reserve at december  was associated with a million commercial construction loan located in the company s primary market area 
this loan was collected in full in april the increasing credit concentrations in the company s loan portfolio associated with a smaller number of comparatively larger income property loans versus a larger number of comparatively smaller residential mortgages an increase in unallocated general reserves from thousand at december  to thousand at december  this increase in unallocated reserves resulted from management s concerns about several key factors which management believes have negatively impacted the inherent loss in the company s credit portfolio  including o the california energy crisis  with impacts upon the availability and price of electricity  business costs  consumer spending and disposable income  and the pace of economic activity in the state o the financial difficulties experienced by many technology related companies in the silicon valley area adjacent to the bank s primary market areas o the impact of lower technology stock prices on consumer spending  liquidity  and investment  with a particular concern regarding effects on the demand and pricing for real estate in the bank s primary market areas o the general reduction in national economic growth and the increased volume of layoffs being announced by major corporations non interest income non interest income declined from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to less favorable results on the sale of securities more than offsetting increased non interest income from most other components of the company s fee based businesses 
the company experienced a net pre tax loss of thousand on the sale of mortgage backed and investment securities during  versus a gain of thousand in the gains realized in occurred during the first half of that year  in a comparatively low general interest rate environment that increased the market value of the company s securities 
customer service charges increased from million during to million during due to the growth in the customer base reflected in the increased number of transaction accounts combined with the implementation of a new fee service charge schedule in mid commissions from the sale of non insured products rose from thousand in to thousand in income from loan servicing increased from thousand in to thousand in non interest expense non interest expense totaled million in  up million from million the prior year 
factors contributing to the rise in included compensation and employee benefits increased from million during to million during this increase resulted from a number of factors  including o the hiring of additional staff to support the company s strategic plan  including the bank s first experienced commercial loan officer 
o changes in the company s senior management team 
o the settlement of certain non qualified benefits obligations 
o a thousand accrual for a settlement package for the former president and chief operating officer  arising from the employment agreements between the individual and the company 
this matter was finalized via binding arbitration in o the implementation of an expanded performance based incentive compensation program 
data processing expense increased from million in to million in due to servicing a greater volume of loan and deposit accounts and processing a greater number of transactions  and because of costs associated with the planned data processing conversion 
the greater number of accounts and transaction also led to increased spending on supplies  printing  and postage costs 
the payment of thousand in expenses during the fourth quarter of in support of the planned data processing conversion 
these expenses included costs for travel  training  deconversion services from the existing data processor  and consultants assisting with the technology implementation 
recruitment and relocation expenses for hiring new members of the company s management team  including a new chief executive officer  chief financial officer  controller  and director of commercial lending 
the adoption of a directors emeritus program that provides cash recognition payments to retiring directors meeting certain eligibility requirements 
higher outside professional costs 
the company incurred significant legal costs  in aggregate  during in conjunction with the successful collection of a million non performing loan  a review of charter alternatives  and addressing the potential settlement of claims by the former president chief operating officer 
the company also incurred higher accounting related costs in due to an expansion of its co sourced internal audit program 
primarily because of the higher operating costs described above  the company s average efficiency ratio for increased to  up from during the transformation of the company has also contributed to increases in the efficiency ratio  as up front operating costs and other expenses must often be incurred prior to the realization of associated revenues as the company changes its business mix and redirects its sales efforts 
the company s new management team commenced a series of initiatives to improve the company s efficiency ratio during the second half of however  due to the time required to conclude existing contractual obligations  implement these initiatives including employee training  and conduct required customer notification  many of these initiatives provided little economic benefit during  but were expected to have a greater impact in provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased from million during to million during due to a reduction in pre tax income 
the company s effective book tax rate increased slightly in  in part due to the greater impact of non deductible expenses and other tax related adjustments on a lower base of pre tax income 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets of the company were million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million  or 
investment securities declined from million at december  to million at december  due to the sale of a corporate trust preferred security during in order to generate funding for the company s increasing loan portfolio 
the company s investment security portfolio at december  was composed of two variable rate  quarterly repricing  corporate trust preferred securities issued by major us banks 
these two securities were rated a or better by standard poors rating agency at december  mortgage backed securities declined from million at december  to million at december  this reduction stemmed from ongoing principal repayments including prepayments  maturities  and the sale of mortgage backed securities with a face value of million  partially offset by purchases during the year 
the company decreased the size of its mortgage backed security portfolio during to raise funds for investment into higher yielding loans receivable  improve the interest rate risk profile of the company  and generate additional liquidity for mbbc 
the company significantly altered the mix of its mortgage backed securities portfolio during traditional agency pass through certificates declined from of total mortgage backed securities at december  to at december  in contrast  cmos increased from of total mortgage backed securities at december  to at december  the company undertook this change in mix o to reallocate the company s capacity for longer term  fixed rate assets from the security portfolio to the loan portfolio  where management believes better yields are obtainable for the same level of interest rate risk o to acquire cmos that present relatively more certain cash flows eg planned amortization classes  or pacs than traditional pass through certificates and thereby facilitate the company s cash management o to take advantage of the generally higher yields available in non agency cmos versus those presented by similar profile agency securities all of the cmos were rated aaa by at least one nationally recognized ratings agency at december  loans receivable held for investment  net  were million at december   compared to million at december  this increase stemmed from million in credit commitments during  partially offset by repayments and sales 
the mix in the portfolio of loans receivable held for investment  net  changed significantly during  with a reduced concentration in residential mortgages and a significant increase in the proportion of income property loans multifamily and commercial real estate 
this change in loan mix was pursued in conjunction with the company s strategic plan of transforming itself into a community commercial bank  and thereby financing a broader range of credit needs in the communities served 
this change in mix also supports a greater yield on the loan portfolio and an increase in deposits  as the company seeks to acquire operating accounts for income properties financed and for businesses receiving a line of credit or term business loan 
the company s investment in the capital stock of the fhlb declined in due to a mandatory redemption required by the fhlb 
the company s balance of premises and equipment  net  increased by thousand in primarily due to leasehold improvements at one branch 
this branch was remodeled to enable the leasing of the second floor to a tenant  thereby increasing the company s future monthly rental income 
the company continued to amortize its intangible assets during  reducing their balance from million at december  to million at december  this amortization  which is a non cash charge to operations  bolsters the bank s regulatory capital ratios all else held constant  as intangible assets are deducted from gaap capital in determining regulatory capital 
this amortization also increases the company s tangible book value per share 
during  the liabilities increased by million to million  from million at december  an increase in deposits more than offset declines in other types of liabilities 
total deposits rose from million at december  to million at december  this increase resulted from multiple factors  including the introduction of new checking and money market products and the acquisition of million in certificates of deposit through the state of california time deposit program 
the bank was also successful in attracting some deposit customers during from local competitors undergoing a merger or acquisition 
fhlb advances declined from million at december  to million at december  securities sold under agreements to repurchase declined from million at december  to none at december  the inflow of deposits and the reduction in securities provided sufficient funds to fund the growth in loans receivable  retire maturing borrowings  and prepay certain borrowings during the company did not pursue extensive leveraging via wholesale assets and liabilities during  as management determined that available risk adjusted spreads in the capital markets did not support the associated allocation of capital 
stockholders equity increased million from million at december  to million at december   even with the repurchase of million in treasury shares during and the payment of thousand in cash dividends during the first quarter of the rise in equity resulted from net income  continued amortization of deferred stock compensation  company directors receiving their fees in company stock  and an improvement in the fair value of securities classified as available for sale 
the company reduced its aggregate deferred stock compensation by million during this significant reduction was caused by o esop shares continuing to be committed to be released under the terms of that tax qualified plan o the distribution of certain non qualified deferred compensation payable in company stock o the acceleration of benefits under the recognition and retention plan for outside directors leading to the termination of that plan and the savings of future related administrative expense o continued vesting of shares previously awarded under the performance equity plan for officers and employees o the use of company stock for incentive payments in lieu of cash under certain employee incentive plans liquidity liquidity is actively managed to ensure sufficient funds are available to meet the ongoing needs of both the mbbc and the bank 
liquidity management includes projections of future sources and uses of funds to ensure the availability of sufficient liquid reserves to provide for unanticipated circumstances 
the bank s primary sources of liquidity are deposits  principal and interest payments including prepayments on its asset portfolios  retained earnings  fhlb advances  other borrowings  and  to a lesser extent  sales of loans originated for sale and securities classified as available for sale 
the bank s primary uses of funds include loan originations  customer drawdowns on lines of credit and undisbursed construction loan commitments  loan purchases  customer withdrawals of deposits  interest paid on liabilities  and operating expenses 
specific steps the bank has taken to maintain strong liquidity include o arranging four federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks in an aggregate amount of million 
funds under these lines are provided on an available  as opposed to on a committed  basis 
o completing agreements to be able to issue dtc or publicly traded certificates of deposit through two large investment banks with significant national client bases 
the bank intends to enter into a third such agreement in o signing psa agreements with a greater number of approved counterparties to facilitate the sale of securities under agreements to repurchase 
o enrolling in the specific loan pledging program with the fhlb sf and pledging multifamily and commercial real estate loans in addition to residential mortgages to the fhlb sf to increase the bank s borrowing capacity 
o participating in the state of california time deposit program 
o reducing the duration of its security portfolio during to provide greater monthly cash flows 
the bank pledges excess collateral to the fhlb in order to have ready access to additional liquidity 
at december   the bank maintained available borrowing capacity in excess of million at the fhlb 
in addition  at december   the bank owned unpledged loans and securities that could be used for either liquidation or secured borrowings in order to meet future liquidity requirements 
from time to time  depending upon its asset and liability strategy  the bank considers converting a portion of its residential whole loans into mortgage backed securities 
these conversions provide increased liquidity because the mortgage backed securities are typically more readily marketable than the underlying loans and because they can more effectively be used as collateral for borrowings 
the bank did not securitize any portion of its residential mortgages during the years the company s ratio of net loans to deposits was at december  in  the company intends to actively manage this ratio by o introducing new deposit products and related services  including internet banking for businesses o modifying staff incentive programs to more strongly focus on expanding deposit relationships o pursuing opportunities for additional branch locations o directing a higher percentage of the advertising and promotion budget to deposit generation at december   the bank maintained million in commitments to originate loans and lines of credit

for additional information regarding commitments and contingencies  including available customer balances under committed lines of credit  please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
mbbc  as a company separate from the bank  must provide for its own liquidity 
substantially all of mbbc s cash inflows are obtained from interest on its security and cash equivalent positions  repayment of the funds advanced for the esop  exercise of vested stock options  sales of treasury shares to the bank for subsequent payment as director fees  and dividends declared and paid by the bank 
there are statutory and regulatory provisions that limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to mbbc 
as of december   mbbc did not have any commitments for capital expenditures or to fund loans 
at december   mbbc maintained a revolving million line of credit from a correspondent bank of the bank 
this line of credit is secured by  shares of mbbc s treasury stock 
there were no outstanding balances on this line of credit at december  during  mbbc renegotiated this line of credit to increase the facility from million to million and eliminate restrictions on the use of the line of credit to repurchase mbbc s common stock 
the line of credit agreement contains various financial performance and reporting covenants 
the terms of the line of credit do not impact or restrict mbbc s ability to pay cash dividends 
the line of credit expires in december management obtained this line of credit as a source of additional liquidity for mbbc  and  through mbbc  for the bank 
the company expects to renew this line of credit or establish a similar line of credit with another bank at the end of at december   mbbc had cash and cash equivalents of million 
this sum is sufficient to provide for approximately ten years of mbbc s current operating expenses in the absence of any cash inflows 
management knows of no factors that would restrict or eliminate the normally recurring cash inflows obtained by mbbc 
capital resources the bank s position as a well capitalized financial institution under the pca regulatory framework is further enhanced by the financial resources present at the mbbc holding company level

note to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information concerning the bank s regulatory capital position  including amounts by which the bank exceeds minimum and well capitalized thresholds for regulatory capital 
management believes the bank s regulatory capital position in will continue to benefit from three key factors o the continued amortization of intangible assets o the continued amortization of deferred stock compensation o the bank s earnings for the year the potential continued increase in the size of the loan portfolio  combined with the ongoing planned shift in mix toward construction  income property  and business lending  may result in the bank s having higher levels of nominal and risk weighted assets during  thereby possibly offsetting the effect of the above factors upon regulatory capital ratios

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  which requires the measurement of most financial positions and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike industrial companies  the company s assets and liabilities are nearly all monetary in nature 
consequently  relative and absolute levels of interest rates present a greater impact on the company s performance and condition than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
the company s operating costs  however  are subject to the impact of inflation  particularly in the case of salaries and benefits costs  which typically constitute almost one half of the company s total non interest expense

alco is responsible for managing the company s financial assets and liabilities in a manner that balances profitability  irr  and various other risks eg liquidity 
alco operates under policies and within risk limits prescribed by and periodically reviewed and approved by the board of directors 
the primary objective of the company s irr management program is to maximize net interest income while controlling irr exposure to within prudent levels 
financial institutions are subject to irr whenever assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times repricing  or gap  risk  based upon different capital markets indices basis risk  for different terms yield curve risk  or are subject to various embedded options  such as the right of mortgage borrowers to refinance their loans when general market interest rates decline 
companies with high concentrations of real estate lending  such as the company  are significantly impacted by prepayment rates on loans  as such prepayments generally return investable funds to the company at a time of relatively lower prevailing general market interest rates 
decisions to control or accept irr are analyzed with consideration of the probable occurrence of future interest rate changes 
stated another way  irr management encompasses the evaluation of the likely additional return associated with an incremental change in the irr profile of the company 
for example  having liabilities that mature or reprice faster than assets can be beneficial when interest rates decline  but may be detrimental when interest rates rise 
assessment of potential changes in market interest rates and the relative financial impact to earnings and npv is used by the company to help quantify and manage irr 
as with credit risk  the complete elimination of irr would curtail the company s profitability  as the company generates a return  in part  through effective risk management 
the company monitors its interest rate risk using various analytical methods that include participation in the ots net portfolio value interest rate risk modeling 
the company s exposure to irr as of december  was within the limits established by the board of directors 
a common  if analytically limited  measure of financial institution irr is the institution s static gap 
static gap is the difference between the amount of assets and liabilities adjusted by off balance sheet positions  if any that are expected to mature or reprice within a specified period 
a static gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities in a given time period or cumulatively through that time period 
the converse is true for a negative static gap 
the following table presents the maturity and rate sensitivity of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  the repricing gap figures in the table reflect the estimated difference between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that are contractually scheduled to mature or reprice whichever occurs first during future periods 
at december  more than more than more than non months months year years over interest or less to year to years to years years bearing total dollars in thousands assets interest earning cash equivalents investment securities   mortgage backed securities    loans held for sale loans receivable  net of lip       fhlb stock   gross interest earning assets       plus less unamortized yield adjustments allowance for loan losses   interest earning assets        non interest earning assets   total assets        liabilities and equity now accounts   savings accounts   money market accounts   certificates of deposit      total interest bearing deposits      borrowings      total interest bearing liabilities       non interest bearing liabilities   stockholders equity   total liabilities and equity        periodic repricing gap      cumulative repricing gap      periodic repricing gap as a of interest earning assets cumulative repricing gap as a of interest earning assets cumulative net interest earning assets as a of cumulative interest bearing liabilities as presented in the prior table  at december   the company s cumulative one year and three year static gaps  based upon contractual repricing and maturities ie ignoring prepayments and other non contractual factors were and  respectively  of total interest earning assets 
these figures suggest that net interest income would increase if general market interest rates were to decline and vice versa  reflecting a net liability sensitive position 
however  static gap analysis such as that presented above fails to capture material components of irr  and therefore provides only a limited  point in time view of the company s irr exposure 
the assumptions and factors that are by definition excluded from static gap analysis prepared on a contractual basis encompass o prepayments on assets o how rate movements and the shape of the treasury curve  or the libor swap curve  affect borrower behavior o that all loans and deposits repricing at a given time will not adjust to the same degree or by the same magnitude o that the nature of rate changes for assets and liabilities in the over one year category have a greater long term economic impact than those for shorter term assets and liabilities o transaction deposit accounts significant to the company do not have scheduled repricing dates or contractual maturities  and therefore may respond to interest rate changes differently than other financial instruments o potential company strategic and operating responses to changes in absolute and relative interest rate levels o the financial impact of options embedded in various financial instruments another measure of irr  required to be performed by insured depository institutions regulated by the ots  is a procedure specified by thrift bulletin a  interest rate risk management 
this test measures the impact upon npv of an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in basis point increments 
the following table presents the estimated impacts of such changes in interest rates upon the company as of december   calculated in compliance with thrift bulletin a 
however  the results from any cash flow simulation model are dependent upon a lengthy series of assumptions about current and future economic  behavioral  and financial conditions  including many factors over which the company has no control 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  prepayment rates on various asset portfolios and decay rates on core deposits  including savings  checking  and money market accounts 
because of the uncertainty regarding the accuracy of assumptions utilized and because such an analytical technique does not contemplate any actions the company might undertake in response to changes in interest rates  no assurance can be provided that the valuations presented in the following table are representative of what might actually be obtainable 
in addition  the following figures are by definition not indicative of the company s economic value as a going concern or of the company s market value 
projected change from base scenario in dollars in thousands npv dollars percent change in interest rates in basis points base scenario  note npv results for downward rate changes of more than basis points were not calculated at due to the low level of interest rates 
the level of interest rate risk exposure presented in the above table is generally considered low in the financial services industry 
the prior table results show that the company s liquidation value benefits from declining interest rates  and is reduced by rising interest rates 
such results are directionally consistent with the static gap analysis presented above 
the reduction in net portfolio value associated with rising interest rate scenarios in part results from the embedded options  held by borrowers  within most mortgage related products  as described in the following two paragraphs 
under rising interest rates  the company s assets experience a lengthening of duration and slower repricing relative to the liability side  resulting in a reduction of npv 
this occurs due to the slower prepayment behavior under rising rates the analysis assumed on mortgage related assets  and in conjunction with embedded options such as periodic and lifetime rate adjustment caps on adjustable rate loans 
this prepayment behavior is a result of borrowers behaving in their economic self interests by more slowly or not at all curtailing or prepaying loans with interest rates at or below current market rates 
under falling interest rates  the increase in the company s net portfolio value is constrained by a shortening of asset duration 
this occurs due to the faster prepayment behavior under falling rates the analysis assumed on mortgage related assets  as borrowers take advantage of a lower interest rate environment to refinance their loans 
this assumed refinancing provides cash flow into the company at a time when reinvestment alternatives present lower rates than the assets being paid off 
therefore  due to borrower use of embedded options in mortgage loans  the company s net portfolio value increases less in a declining rate scenario than it falls in a similar rising rate scenario 
this financial pattern is typical of community banks that have residential mortgages as a significant component of their loan portfolios 
a considerable portion of the total irr exposure at december  was concentrated in two portfolios hybrid ie fixed for years  then variable residential mortgages long term  fixed rate residential mortgages held for investment the company added significant volumes of hybrid residential mortgages to its balance sheet early in  including loan pool purchases  in order to take advantage of the rapidly declining interest rate environment and better leverage the bank s capital position 
in addition  customer demand for hybrid mortgages was strong in  fueled in the latter half of the year by the steeper treasury yield curve that rendered these products comparatively attractively priced versus longer term  fixed rate mortgages 
during  the company continued selling the vast majority of its long term  fixed rate residential mortgage originations  leading to a decline in that portfolio segment throughout the year as older loans amortized and prepaid 
as general market interest rates appeared to be approaching a cyclical bottom in the latter part of  the company implemented various steps to reduce its net liability sensitivity 
these actions included o decreasing the duration of the securities portfolio o pricing loan products to more strongly encourage customer selection of more interest rate sensitive loans o extending the term structure of borrowings o actively marketing longer term certificates of deposit in addition  the company s strategic plan encompasses a reduced net liability sensitivity through the growth of transaction deposit account balances  particularly comparatively interest rate insensitive checking accounts  and the expansion of commercial banking 
commercial banking is by nature an asset sensitive business  as loans are generally variable rate  frequently based upon the prime rate  while deposits often include a significant non interest bearing demand deposit component 
in addition  the planned shift in loan mix away from the historical concentration in residential mortgages toward generally more interest rate sensitive  and higher yielding  income property and construction loans is also planned to reduce the company s net liability sensitivity 
despite the company s irr management program and the initiatives detailed above  due to the multiple factors which influence the company s exposure to irr  many of which are beyond the control of the company  there can be no assurance that the company s earnings or economic value will be maintained in future periods  nor that the company will be successful in continuing to maintain a relatively low level of irr exposure
