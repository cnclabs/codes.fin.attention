sales were also negatively impacted by the inventory rationalization programs undertaken at the office superstores in the second quarter of fiscal year and by customer delays in new product launches at bush technologies 
the company s cost of sales were  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year  or a decrease of  this decrease primarily reflects the lower sales levels as compared to the prior year 
the cost of sales as an approximate percentage of net sales increased by from in to in the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales primarily reflects lower absorption of manufacturing overhead as a result of decreased production volumes  both as the result of the decreased sales levels and the reduction of finished goods inventory levels  and as a result of a  pre tax  non cash inventory write down in the fourth quarter of fiscal year for  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  compared to the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of a reduction in various selling expenses such as commissions  marketing and promotional incentives 
these reductions were a result of both the company s lower sales volumes and as a result of a change in sales terms with two customers 
this change  in which various marketing and promotional incentives were replaced with a reduction in sales prices to the two customers  had no impact on net earnings  but resulted in a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses and a corresponding decrease in net sales 
since this change occurred in mid fiscal year  it impacted the second half of such year and all of fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses increased as an approximate percentage of net sales from in to in interest expense decreased to  in or approximately of net sales from  in or approximately of net sales 
the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to decreases in the interest rates paid on the company s revolving credit facility 
the company s overall effective federal  state and local tax rate increased from in to in the increase was primarily due to the effects of permanent non deductible items such as certain travel and entertainment expenses and the amortization of certain goodwill costs  fixed taxes such as delaware franchise taxes and a change in the mix of the allocation of income for state income tax purposes

the company s overall effective federal  state and local tax rate decreased from in to in the rate in fiscal year was uncharacteristically high primarily due to the impact of the lower deferred tax rates attributable to the then owned rohr bush subsidiary and the relationship of the rohr bush operating loss to consolidated income

incomes taxes payable decreased as a result of the company s decreased earnings  and the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily represents an overpayment of taxes refunded in the first quarter of fiscal year total assets at fiscal year end decreased  over fiscal year end primarily as a result of a decrease in accounts receivable and inventories  as discussed above  and a decrease in property  plant and equipment which reflects capital expenditures that are less than the level of depreciation

eurocurrency loans bear interest at the then current applicable libor rate  plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin  which pertains only to libor and nybor rate loans  varies from to  depending upon the company s ability to satisfy certain quarterly financial tests
