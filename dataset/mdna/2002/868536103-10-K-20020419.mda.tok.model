critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
lifo and retail inventory method for a significant portion of the company s inventory  cost is determined through use of the last in  first out lifo method for food distribution or the retail lifo method  as applicable 
under the retail lifo method  otherwise referred to as the retail inventory method rim  the valuation of inventories are at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
inherent in the rim calculations are certain significant management judgments and estimates  including shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost  as well as the resulting gross margins 
these judgments and estimates  coupled with the fact that the rim is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  produce results which differ from actual 
management believes that the company s rim provides an inventory valuation which reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
allowances for losses on receivables management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of its accounts and notes receivable portfolios 
in determining the adequacy of the allowances  management analyzes the value of the collateral  customer financial statements  historical collection experience  aging of receivables and other economic and industry factors 
it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially impacted by different judgments as to collectibility based on the information considered and further deterioration of accounts 
reserves for closed properties the company maintains reserves for estimated losses on retail stores  distribution warehouses and other properties that are no longer being utilized in current operations 
calculating the estimated losses requires significant judgments and estimates to be made by management 
the company s reserves for closed properties could be materially affected by factors such as the extent of interested buyers  its ability to secure subleases  the creditworthiness of sublessees and the company s success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors 
these factors are significantly dependent on the general health of the economy and resultant demand for commercial property 
while management believes the current estimates of reserves on closed properties are adequate  it is possible that changes in events could cause changes in the company s assumptions  requiring additional reserves to be recorded 
reserves for self insurance the company is primarily self insured for workers compensation and general and automobile liability costs 
it is the company s policy to record its self insurance liabilities based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation and general and automobile liability is subject to a considerable degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns

the decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the million cash used for a portion of the richfood acquisition in fiscal  offset in part by proceeds from the sale of hazelwood farms bakeries 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal and compared with cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal the increase in cash used in financing activities as compared to fiscal reflects higher debt reduction in fiscal in fiscal  cash was used primarily to reduce long term debt
