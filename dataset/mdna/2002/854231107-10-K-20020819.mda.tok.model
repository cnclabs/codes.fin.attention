item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company mitigates certain of its foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into forward foreign currency contracts 
these contracts are primarily used as a hedge against anticipated foreign cash flows  such as dividend and loan payments  and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  as an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates from market rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts 
however  any such losses or gains would generally be offset by corresponding gains and losses  respectively  on the related hedged asset or liability 
due to the absence of forward foreign currency contracts at june   the company did not have any fair value exposure 
the company s interest rate exposure is limited primarily to interest rate changes on its variable rate borrowings 
as of june   a hypothetical immediate increase in interest rates would increase the company s annual interest expense by  the company has an interest rate swap agreement to fix the interest rate on million of its variable rate borrowings 
at june   the fair value of the company s interest rate swap agreement would not be materially affected by a change in interest rates 
in addition to the million of variable rate borrowings covered by the interest rate swap agreement  the company also has million of long term debt at fixed interest rates as of june  there would be no immediate impact on the company s interest expense associated with its long term debt due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
however  based on a hypothetical immediate decrease in market interest rates  the fair value of the company s long term debt would be increased by approximately million as of june  such fair value changes may affect the company s determination as to whether to retain  replace or retire its long term debt
