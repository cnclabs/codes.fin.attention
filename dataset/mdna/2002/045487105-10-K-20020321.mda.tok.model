item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is management s analysis to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of associated banc corp the parent company  together with its affiliates and subsidiaries the corporation 
it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report 
during  the corporation merged all of the wisconsin bank affiliates associated bank south central  associated bank north  associated bank milwaukee  associated bank  national association  associated bank lakeshore  national association  and associated bank green bay  national association into a single national banking charter  headquartered in green bay  wisconsin  under the name associated bank  national association 
certain nonbank subsidiaries associated leasing  inc  associated banc corp services  inc  and associated commercial mortgage  inc also merged with and into the resultant bank  becoming operating divisions of associated bank  national association 
the financial discussion that follows may refer to the impact of the corporation s business combination activity  detailed under section business combinations and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the detailed financial discussion focuses on results compared to discussion of results to is predominantly in section compared to performance summary the corporation recorded net income of million for the year ended december   an increase of million or over the million earned in basic earnings per share for were  a increase over basic earnings per share of 
earnings per diluted share were  a increase over diluted earnings per share of 
return on average assets roa and return on average equity roe for were and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  for cash dividends paid in increased by to per share over the per share paid in key factors behind these results were taxable equivalent net interest income was million for  million or higher than interest expense decreased by million  while taxable equivalent interest income decreased million 
the volume of average earning assets increased million to billion  which exceeded the million increase in interest bearing liabilities 
increases in the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as changes in product mix  added million to taxable equivalent net interest income  while changes in interest rates resulted in a million increase 
net interest income and net interest margin were also impacted in by the declining interest rate environment  competitive pricing pressures  branch deposit sales  and funding of stock repurchases 
the federal reserve lowered interest rates an unprecedented eleven times during  producing an average federal funds rate for that was basis points bp lower than the average for the net interest margin was for  a bp increase from for  the net result of the bp increase in interest rate spread  offset by a bp decline in the net free funds contribution 
rates on interest bearing liabilities in were bp lower than last year  while the yield on interest earning assets decreased bp  bringing the interest rate spread up by bp 
total loans were billion at december   an increase of million or over december  the loan mix continued to shift  with commercial loan balances increasing million and representing of total loans at december   compared to at year end total deposits were billion at december   million lower than december   with brokered cds decreasing by million 
to take advantage of the lower rate environment  the corporation increased long term debt by billion  including million of subordinated debt  million of bank notes  and longer term federal home loan bank advances 
asset quality remained relatively strong 
the provision for loan losses increased to million compared to million in net charge offs were million  an increase of million  primarily due to the charge off of several large commercial credits 
net charge offs were of average loans compared to in the ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans was and at december  and  respectively 
nonperforming loans were million  representing of total loans at year end  compared to million or of total loans last year 
noninterest income was million for  million or higher than net gains on the sales of assets and investment securities totaled million in  compared to net gains of million in excluding these asset and security sales  noninterest income was million  or million over mortgage banking revenue more than doubled  adding million over the prior year  and service charges on deposit accounts were up million over partially offsetting these increases were an million reduction in trust service fees and a million decrease in retail commissions 
noninterest expense was million  up million or over personnel expenses rose million  of which million was attributable to salary expense and million was due to fringe benefit expense 
mortgage servicing rights expense increased million  predominantly driven by an increase to the valuation reserve on mortgage servicing rights 
all other expense categories were down  in total  million 
income tax expense increased to million  up million from the effective tax rate in was compared to for the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in net income before tax  an increase in state tax expense  and a decrease in tax valuation allowance adjustments 
business combinations there were no business combinations during or there was one transaction pending at december   which was consummated in february  as noted below 
there were three business combination transactions completed during the corporation s business combination activity is further summarized in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on september   the corporation announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire signal financial corporation signal of mendota heights  minnesota 
based upon the corporation s closing stock price on september  the date of public announcement of the acquisition and other terms of the merger agreement  the acquisition price is approximately million  of which  million will be paid in cash and the remainder in the corporation s common stock 
on february   the corporation consummated its acquisition of of the outstanding common shares of signal 
as the transaction was accounted for under the purchase method  the results of operations of signal will be included by the corporation beginning on the consummation date  and therefore  are not included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
at february   signal reported billion in total assets 
income statement analysis net interest income net interest income is the primary source of the corporation s revenue 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense on interest bearing deposits and other borrowings  used to fund those and other assets or activities 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and by the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
additionally  net interest income is impacted by the sensitivity of the balance sheet to changes in interest rates which factors in characteristics such as the fixed or variable nature of the financial instruments  contractual maturities  and repricing frequencies 
net interest income in the consolidated statements of income which excludes the taxable equivalent adjustment on tax exempt assets was million  compared to million last year 
the taxable equivalent adjustments the adjustments to bring tax exempt interest to a level that would yield the same after tax income had that income been subject to taxation  using a tax rate of million for and million for  resulted in fully taxable equivalent net interest income of million and million  respectively 
the taxable equivalent adjustment between years was relatively unchanged up  and was in line with the growth in average municipal securities balances 
tax equivalent net interest income was million for  an increase of million or from the increase in tax equivalent net interest income was primarily attributable to the benefit of lower interest rates  particularly on the cost of interest bearing liabilities  and a higher level of earning assets 
interest rates fell steadily during  but were generally rising during comparatively  the average federal funds rate for was bp lower than for  while the rate at december   was bp lower than at december  interest rate spread and net interest margin are utilized to measure and explain changes in net interest income 
interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid for interest bearing liabilities that fund those assets 
the net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average earning assets 
the net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread because noninterest bearing sources of funds net free funds  principally demand deposits and stockholders equity  also support earning assets 
to compare tax exempt asset yields to taxable yields  the yield on tax exempt loans and securities is computed on a tax equivalent basis 
net interest income  interest rate spread  and net interest margin are discussed further on a tax equivalent basis 
table provides average balances of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the associated interest income and expense  and the corresponding interest rates earned and paid  as well as net interest income  interest rate spread  and net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis for the three years ended december  tables through present additional information to facilitate the review and discussion of tax equivalent net interest income  interest rate spread  and net interest margin 
as indicated in tables and  increases in volume and changes in the mix of both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities added million to tax equivalent net interest income  while changes in the rates resulted in a million increase  for a net increase of million 
the net interest margin for was  compared to in the bp increase in net interest margin is attributable to a bp increase in interest rate spread ie  an bp decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities  net of a bp decrease in the yield on earning assets  partially offset by a bp lower contribution from net free funds 
in conjunction with the stock buy back programs see further detail under section capital  million was used in for the repurchase of million shares of common stock  while million was used in to repurchase million shares 
given the lower interest rate environment of  the combination of buying back fewer shares and lower funding costs favorably impacted the net interest margin by approximately bp in for  the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased bp  impacted favorably by the declining rate environment during  reducing interest expense by million with interest bearing deposits accounting for million of the decrease 
the combined average cost of interest bearing deposits excluding brokered cds was  down bp  primarily from carrying a higher proportion of lower costing transaction accounts during versus higher costing brokered cds fell to represent of interest bearing liabilities versus for and cost bp less than last year 
the cost of wholesale funds comprised of all short term borrowings and long term debt decreased bp to for primarily a function of the declining rate environment and the predominantly short term nature of the funds which reduced interest expense by million 
for  the yield on earning assets fell bp driven primarily by a bp decline in the loan yield  which decreased interest earned by million with loans accounting for million of the decrease 
the average loan yield was  down bp from last year 
the repricing of variable rate loans  as well as competitive factors on new and refinanced loans  in the declining interest rate environment  put downward pressure on loan yields for  as did the sale of the higher yielding credit card receivables in april the yield on securities and short term investments combined was down only bp  supported by portfolio strategies that started during to mitigate interest rate risk  decreasing tax equivalent interest income by an aggregate million 
in combination  the growth and composition change of earning assets contributed an additional million to tax equivalent net interest income  while the growth and composition of interest bearing liabilities cost an additional million  netting a million increase to tax equivalent net interest income 
average earning assets were billion in  an increase of million  or  from loans accounted for the majority of the growth in earning assets  increasing to of average earning assets  compared to for average loans were billion in  up million or compared to  despite the sale of million of credit card receivables in april and despite high refinancing and sales of residential mortgages in during  the corporation continued to focus on shifting the composition of its loan portfolio  growing the proportion of commercial loans  which represented of average loans for compared to for for  tax equivalent interest income on loans increased million from growth  but decreased million from the impact of the rate environment as noted above  for a net decrease of million versus last year see table 
in support of funding a portion of the loan growth  securities and short term investments combined decreased million on average 
thus  for  tax equivalent interest income on securities and short term investments decreased million from the volume changes  and decreased million from the rate changes as noted above  for a net million decrease to tax equivalent interest income 
average interest bearing liabilities were billion in  a slight increase of million  or  from while relatively unchanged in balance  the mix of interest bearing liabilities changed significantly compared to last year 
average interest bearing deposits  a predominant source of funding down million or  represented of average interest bearing liabilities for  compared to last year  driven by a reduction in brokered cds as cheaper funding sources were utilized 
without the brokered cds  interest bearing deposits represented of average interest bearing liabilities for  versus last year 
given this decline and coupled with the growth in earning assets and other cash needs  the corporation increased its use of wholesale funding 
to take advantage of the lower rate environment  improve liquidity  and mitigate interest rate risk  the corporation increased its long term debt to of average interest bearing liabilities  compared to for therefore  for  interest expense on interest bearing deposits decreased million  the result of a million reduction from the declines in volume and a million reduction from the favorable impact of the rate environment 
to reiterate  brokered cds were the predominant driver of this change primarily from utilization of less expensive funding sources  down million and costing bp less in than  while all other non brokered interest bearing deposits were down million and cost bp less than last year 
total interest bearing deposits cost on average for bp less than last year 
total wholesale funds including all short term and long term funding sources other than interest bearing deposits were billion on average for  up million or  with million of the increase in average long term debt 
wholesale funding on a combined basis cost bp lower than last year  of which long term debt cost on average for bp lower than 
thus  for  interest expense on wholesale funds decreased million  attributable to a million decrease from the favorable impact of the rate environment  offset partially by a million increase from the growth in volume

the change was predominantly due to a decrease in the market value of assets under management  a function of the market and competitive market conditions 
trust assets under management totaled billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
service charges on deposits were million  million higher than primarily due to benefiting from the mid year increases  changes in non sufficient fund overdraft charges and other service charges  and lower waive percentages 
mortgage banking income was million in  an increase of million  more than double the level 
mortgage banking income consists of servicing fees  the gain or loss on sales of mortgage loans to the secondary market  gains on sales of servicing  and production related revenue origination  underwriting  and escrow waiver fees 
the increase was driven primarily by a significant increase in secondary mortgage loan production and related sales between comparable periods billion of production in versus million in 
the higher production levels positively impacted gains on sales of mortgages up million  of which  million was related to gains in the fair value of mortgage derivatives and million was due to the sale of mortgage servicing rights and volume related fees up million 
servicing fees were down million compared to  in line with the decline in the portfolio serviced for others 
the portfolio serviced for others was down to billion from billion at december   due to sales of mortgage servicing rights on a portion of the portfolio  partially offset by increases attributable to higher sales volume 
credit card and other nondeposit fees were million for  an increase of million or over  with million in increased merchant income and a million decline in other nondeposit charges 
the other credit card revenue was enhanced by the april acquisition agreement and five year agency agreement with citibank usa which provide for agent fees and other income on new and existing card business 
retail commission income which includes commissions from insurance and brokerage product sales was million  down million or compared to last year

occupancy and equipment expense on a combined basis was million for  essentially unchanged from last year 
data processing costs decreased to million  down million or over last year  attributable to lower overall vendor costs related to the change in service providers and the system conversion in mid business development and advertising decreased to million for  down million compared to  primarily in television advertising for a branding campaign in mortgage servicing rights expense includes the amortization of the mortgage servicing rights asset and increases or decreases to the valuation allowance associated with the mortgage servicing rights asset 
amortization of mortgage servicing rights increased by million between and  predominantly driven by an increase of million to the valuation reserve during  reflecting the decline in interest rates in and the acceleration in prepayment speeds in the portfolio of loans serviced for others 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the corporation s accounting policy for mortgage servicing rights  which is considered a critical accounting policy given that estimating the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights involves judgment  particularly of estimated prepayment speeds of the underlying mortgages serviced 
a valuation allowance is established to the extent the carrying value of the mortgage servicing rights exceeds the estimated fair value 
net income could be affected if management s estimate of the prepayment speeds or other factors differ materially from actual prepayments 
mortgage servicing rights  included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet  were million  net of a million valuation allowance at december  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
intangible amortization decreased to million  primarily as the result of the reduction of intangibles associated with the six branches sold during intangible amortization includes amortization of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
under the provisions of a new accounting pronouncement  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized beginning january  see further discussion under note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

income taxes income tax expense for was million  up million from income tax expense of million 
the corporation s effective tax rate income tax expense divided by income before taxes was in compared to in the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in net income before tax  an increase in state tax expense  and a decrease in tax valuation allowance adjustments 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the corporation s income tax accounting policy 
income tax expense recorded in the consolidated income statement involves interpretation and application of certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes  and is  therefore  considered a critical accounting policy 
the corporation undergoes examination by various regulatory taxing authorities 
such agencies may require that changes in the amount of tax expense or valuation allowance be recognized when their interpretations differ from those of management  based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations

commercial loans were billion  up million or 
commercial loans grew to represent of total loans at the end of  up from at year end changing the mix of loans to include more commercial loans continued to be a strategic initiative during also the decrease in residential real estate was strongly influenced by refinance activity and sales of current year production into the secondary market

loans of this type are in a diverse range of industries 
the credit risk related to commercial loans is largely influenced by general economic conditions and the resulting impact on a borrower s operations 
within the commercial  financial  and agricultural classification  loans to finance agricultural production totaled million  only of total loans  at december  real estate construction loans grew million or to million  representing of the total loan portfolio at the end of  compared to million or at the end of loans in this classification are primarily short term interim loans that provide financing for the acquisition or development of commercial real estate  such as multifamily or other commercial development projects 
real estate construction loans are made to developers and project managers who are well known to the corporation  have prior successful project experience  and are well capitalized 
projects undertaken by these developers are carefully reviewed by the corporation to ensure that they are economically viable 
loans of this type are primarily made to customers based in the corporation s tri state market in which the corporation has a thorough knowledge of the local market economy 
the credit risk associated with real estate construction loans is generally confined to specific geographic areas  but is also influenced by general economic conditions 
the corporation controls the credit risk on these types of loans by making loans in familiar markets to developers  underwriting the loans to meet the requirements of institutional investors in the secondary market  reviewing the merits of individual projects  controlling loan structure  and monitoring project progress and construction advances 
commercial real estate includes loans secured by farmland  multifamily properties  and nonfarm nonresidential real estate properties 
commercial real estate totaled billion at december   up million or over last year and comprised of total loans outstanding versus at year end commercial real estate loans involve borrower characteristics similar to those discussed above for commercial loans and real estate construction projects 
loans of this type are mainly for business and industrial properties  multifamily properties  community purpose properties  and similar properties 
loans are primarily made to customers based in wisconsin  illinois  and minnesota 
credit risk is managed in a similar manner to commercial loans and real estate construction by employing sound underwriting guidelines  lending to borrowers in known markets and businesses  and formally reviewing the borrower s financial soundness and relationship on an ongoing basis 
in many cases the corporation will take additional real estate collateral to further secure the overall lending relationship 
residential mortgage loans totaled billion at the end of  down million or from the prior year and comprised of total loans outstanding versus at year end loans in this classification include residential real estate which consists of conventional home mortgages and second mortgages and home equity lines 
residential real estate loans generally limit the maximum loan to of collateral value 
residential real estate loans were billion at december   down million or compared to last year  principally due to high refinance activity influenced strongly by the lower rate environment in compared to and sales of the majority of current year production into the secondary market

installment loans include short term installment loans  direct and indirect automobile loans  recreational vehicle loans  credit card loans which are primarily business oriented following the april sale to citibank usa of million of retail credit card receivables  student loans  and other personal loans 
individual borrowers may be required to provide related collateral or a satisfactory endorsement or guaranty from another person  depending on the specific type of loan and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
credit risk for these types of loans is generally greatly influenced by general economic conditions  the characteristics of individual borrowers  and the nature of the loan collateral 
credit risk is primarily controlled by reviewing the creditworthiness of the borrowers as well as taking appropriate collateral and guaranty positions on such loans 
factors that are critical to managing overall credit quality are sound loan underwriting and administration  systematic monitoring of existing loans and commitments  effective loan review on an ongoing basis  early identification of potential problems  an adequate allowance for loan losses  and sound nonaccrual and charge off policies 
an active credit risk management process is used for commercial loans to further ensure that sound and consistent credit decisions are made 
credit risk is controlled by detailed underwriting procedures  comprehensive loan administration  and periodic review of borrowers outstanding loans and commitments 
borrower relationships are formally reviewed on an ongoing basis for early identification of potential problems 
further analyses by customer  industry  and geographic location are performed to monitor trends  financial performance  and concentrations 
the loan portfolio is widely diversified by types of borrowers  industry groups  and market areas 
significant loan concentrations are considered to exist for a financial institution when there are amounts loaned to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
at december   no concentrations of any type existed in the corporation s portfolio in excess of of total loans 
allowance for loan losses the investment and loan portfolios are the corporation s primary interest earning assets 
while the investment portfolio is structured with minimum credit exposure to the corporation  the loan portfolio is the primary asset subject to credit risk 
credit risk is controlled and monitored through the use of lending standards  thorough review of potential borrowers  and on going review of loan payment performance 
active asset quality administration  including early problem loan identification and timely resolution of problems  further ensures appropriate management of credit risk and minimization of loan losses 
credit risk management for each loan type is discussed briefly in the section entitled loans 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  compared to million at december  the million increase was the net result of million provision for loan losses  offset by million of net charge offs 
as of december   the allowance for loan losses to total loans was and covered of nonperforming loans  compared to and  respectively  at december  tables and provide additional information regarding activity in the allowance for loan losses and table provides additional information regarding nonperforming loans 
the provision for loan losses in was million 
in comparison  the provision for loan losses for was million and million in the provision for loan losses is predominantly a function of the result of the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses

ratio of allowance for loan losses to net charge offs ratio of net charge offs to average loans ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans at end of period the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of an amount adequate to provide for probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
see management s allowance for loan losses accounting policy in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on management s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio  consideration of past loan loss experience  trends in past due and nonperforming loans  risk characteristics of the various classifications of loans  existing economic conditions  the fair value of underlying collateral  and other factors which could affect potential credit losses 
assessing these numerous factors involves significant judgment  and therefore  management considers the allowance for loan losses a critical accounting policy 
in general  the change in the allowance for loan losses is a function of a number of factors  including but not limited to changes in the loan portfolio see table  net charge offs see table  and nonperforming loans see table 
first  total loan growth from year end to was up slightly to 
the growth was strongest in the commercial portfolio particularly commercial real estate  commercial  financial  and agricultural loans  and construction loans  which grew million or to represent of total loans at year end compared to last year end 
this segment of the loan portfolio carries greater inherent credit risk described under section loans 
net charge offs for have increased to million 
the rise in net charge offs is largely due to the charge off of several large commercial credits accountable for approximately million of charge offs 
finally  nonperforming loans to total loans grew to for compared to last year 
the allocation of the corporation s allowance for loan losses for the last five years is shown in table the allocation methodology applied by the corporation  designed to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  focuses on changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  changes in levels of impaired and other nonperforming loans  the risk inherent in specific loans  concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries  existing economic conditions  and historical losses on each portfolio category 
because each of the criteria used is subject to change  the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future loan losses in any particular loan category 
the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio 
management continues to target and maintain the allowance for loan losses equal to the allocation methodology plus an unallocated portion  as determined by economic conditions on the corporation s borrowers 
for both and  estimation methods and assumptions included consideration of year issues on significant customers 
management allocates the allowance for loan losses for credit losses by pools of risk 
the business loan commercial real estate  commercial  financial  and agricultural  leases  and real estate construction allocation is based on a quarterly review of individual loans  loan types  and industries 
the retail loan residential real estate  home equity  and consumer allocation is based on analysis of historical delinquency and charge off statistics and trends 
minimum loss factors used by the corporation for criticized loan categories are consistent with regulatory agency factors 
loss factors for non criticized loan categories are based primarily on historical loan loss experience and peer group statistics 
the mechanism used to address differences between estimated and actual loan loss experience includes review of recent nonperforming loan trends  underwriting trends  external factors  and management s judgment relating to current assumptions 
the allocation methods used for december  and were generally comparable 
however  the uncertainty of current economic conditions on the business results of numerous individual borrowers and certain industries is being monitored carefully  as is the increased pace at which the financial results of a borrower s company can take a downturn from difficult and varied economic conditions 
therefore  the allocations for criticized loans in substandard and watch categories were increased 
the amount allocated to commercial  financial and agricultural loans in represented of the allowance for loan losses  compared to last year 
in for this category  a greater amount of these loans were in criticized loan categories and for which specific allocations were made 
thus  as anticipated  table evidences that this category incurred the largest amount of charge offs 
finally  commercial  financial and agricultural loans represent of nonperforming loans compared to last year 
the real estate mortgage category accommodates allowance allocated for commercial real estate and residential real estate 
for  the amount allocated for commercial real estate increased to million  representing of the allowance for loan losses compared to last year 
the increase was a function of changes in the commercial real estate loan category  including increased loan balances  growing to represent of total loans versus at year end  and increased net charge off activity of million for  versus last year of  for compared to  the amount allocated to consumer loans decreased to represent of the allowance for loan losses versus for  predominantly as a function of the sale of million of credit card receivables in mid additionally  the amount allocated to commercial  financial and agricultural loans increased to versus last year  in part for the increase in the amount to criticized categories  as noted above  and since more of these loans were in nonperforming loan categories at year end versus and  respectively 
management carefully considers numerous detailed and general factors  its assumptions  and the likelihood of materially different conditions that could alter its assumptions 
consolidated net income could be affected if management s estimate of the population of loans with possible loss or its estimate of the amount of loss that might be incurred are materially different  requiring additional provision for loan losses to be recorded 
management believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate at december  while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and the impact of such change on the corporation s borrowers 
as an integral part of their examination process  various regulatory agencies also review the allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require that certain loan balance be charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management  based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
table allocation of the allowance for loan losses as of december  in thousands commercial  financial  and agricultural      real estate construction      real estate mortgage      consumer      lease financing unallocated      total allowance for loan losses      net charge offs were million or of average loans for  compared to million or of average loans for  and were million or of average loans for the million increase in net charge offs was primarily driven by higher charge offs of commercial  financial and agricultural loans in versus at million  up million as shown in table 
this rise in charge offs is predominantly due to the charge off of several large commercial credits accountable for approximately million of the charge offs during loans charged off are subject to continuous review  and specific efforts are taken to achieve maximum recovery of principal  accrued interest  and related expenses 
nonperforming loans  potential problem loans  and other real estate owned management is committed to an aggressive nonaccrual and problem loan identification philosophy 
this philosophy is embodied through the ongoing monitoring and reviewing of all pools of risk in the loan portfolio to ensure that all problem loans are identified quickly and the risk of loss is minimized 
nonperforming loans are defined as nonaccrual loans  loans days or more past due but still accruing  and restructured loans 
the corporation specifically excludes from its definition of nonperforming loans student loan balances that are days or more past due and still accruing and that have contractual government guarantees as to collection of principal and interest 
such past due student loans were approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments 
additionally  whenever management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact the collectibility of principal or interest on loans  it is management s practice to place such loans on nonaccrual status immediately  rather than delaying such action until the loans become days past due 
previously accrued and uncollected interest on such loans is reversed  amortization of related loan fees is suspended  and income is recorded only to the extent that interest payments are subsequently received in cash and a determination has been made that the principal balance of the loan is collectible 
if collectibility of the principal is in doubt  payments received are applied to loan principal 
loans past due days or more but still accruing interest are also included in nonperforming loans 
loans past due days or more but still accruing are classified as such where the underlying loans are both well secured the collateral value is sufficient to cover principal and accrued interest and in the process of collection 
also included in nonperforming loans are restructured loans 
restructured loans involve the granting of some concession to the borrower involving the modification of terms of the loan  such as changes in payment schedule or interest rate

nonaccrual loans accounted for million of the increase in nonperforming loans  partially offset by a million decline in accruing loans past due days or more 
commercial nonaccrual loans representing approximately of nonaccrual loans at year end versus at year end increased million  predominantly due to the addition of one large commercial credit totaling approximately million 
accruing loans past due days or more declined as the result of one large commercial credit that went on nonaccrual during  and was subsequently repaid and partially charged off 
the corporation s allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was at year end  down from at year end and at year end other real estate owned decreased to million at december   compared to million and million at year end and  respectively 
net gains on sales of other real estate owned were   and  for   and  respectively 
management actively seeks to ensure properties held are monitored to minimize the corporation s risk of loss 
the following table shows  for those loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis and restructured loans for the years ended as indicated  the gross interest that would have been recorded if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and the amount of interest income that was included in interest income for the period 
table foregone loan interest years ended december  in thousands interest income in accordance with original terms    interest income recognized    reduction in interest income    potential problem loans are loans where there are doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms 
the decision of management to place loans in this category does not necessarily indicate that the corporation expects losses to occur  but that management recognizes that a higher degree of risk is associated with these performing loans 
at december   potential problem loans totaled million 
the loans that have been reported as potential problem loans are not concentrated in a particular industry  but rather cover a diverse range of businesses 
management does not presently expect significant losses from credits in the potential problem loan category 
investment securities portfolio the investment securities portfolio is intended to provide the corporation with adequate liquidity  flexibility in asset liability management  and a source of stable income 
investment securities classified as held to maturity are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at amortized cost while investment securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair market value 
at december   the total carrying value of investment securities represented of total assets  compared to at year end on average  the investment portfolio represented and of average earning assets for and  respectively 
the classification of securities as held to maturity or available for sale is determined at the time of purchase 
beginning in  the corporation began to classify most investment purchases as available for sale 
this is consistent with the corporation s investment philosophy of maintaining flexibility to manage the investment portfolio  particularly in light of asset liability management strategies  including possible securities sales in response to changes in interest rates or prepayment risk  the need to manage regulatory capital  and other factors 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which was adopted by the corporation as required on january   provided for the option  upon adoption  to change the classification of investments held

total deposits excluding brokered cds nonbrokered deposits were relatively flat between year end periods 
the sale of deposits of one branch during decreased deposits by million 
the sale of six branches during decreased deposits at year end by approximately million 
the primary factors influencing the corporation s nonbrokered deposit growth has been competitive pressure from other financial institutions  as well as other investment opportunities available to customers 
during the corporation particularly marketed its business demand deposits and money market accounts  which offer competitive  market indexed rates  and greater customer flexibility 
on average  deposits were billion for  down million or over the average for however  excluding the million decrease in average brokered cds  deposits were down 
as previously mentioned under section net interest income  the decline in average deposits increased the corporation s reliance on wholesale funding  as discussed under section other funding sources

short term borrowings are primarily comprised of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  short term federal home loan bank advances  notes payable to banks  treasury  tax  and loan notes  and commercial paper 
the federal home loan bank advances included in short term borrowings are those with original maturities of less than one year

funds are available from a number of sources  primarily from the core deposit base and from loans and securities repayments and maturities 
additionally  liquidity is provided from sales of the securities portfolio  lines of credit with major banks  the ability to acquire large and brokered deposits  and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale 
the corporation s liquidity management framework includes measurement of several key elements  such as wholesale funding as a percent of total assets and liquid assets to short term wholesale funding 
the corporation s liquidity framework also incorporates contingency planning to assess the nature and volatility of funding sources and to determine alternatives to these sources 
the contingency plan would be activated to ensure the corporation s funding commitments could be met in the event of general market disruption or adverse economic conditions 
strong capital ratios  credit quality and core earnings are essential to retaining high credit ratings and  consequently  cost effective access to the wholesale funding markets 
a downgrade or loss in credit ratings could have an impact on the corporation s ability to access wholesale funding at favorable interest rates 
as a result  capital ratios  asset quality measurements and profitability ratios are monitored on an ongoing basis as part of the liquidity management process

the parent company manages its liquidity position to provide the funds necessary to pay dividends to stockholders  service debt  invest in subsidiaries  repurchase common stock  and satisfy other operating requirements 
the parent company s primary funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements are dividends and service fees from subsidiaries  borrowings with major banks  commercial paper issuance  and proceeds from the issuance of equity 
dividends received in cash from subsidiaries totaled million in and represent a primary funding source 
at december   million in dividends could be paid to the parent by its subsidiaries and affiliates without obtaining prior regulatory approval  subject to the capital needs of the banks 
as discussed in item  the subsidiary banks are subject to regulation and  among other things  may be limited in their ability to pay dividends or transfer funds to the parent company 
accordingly  consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows may not represent cash immediately available for the payment of cash dividends to the corporation s stockholders or for other cash needs 
in addition to affiliate dividends  the parent company has multiple funding sources that could be used to increase liquidity and provide additional financial flexibility 
these sources include a revolving credit facility  commercial paper and a shelf registration 
the parent company has available a million revolving credit facility with established lines of credit from nonaffiliated banks  of which million was available at december  during  a million commercial paper program was initiated  of which million was available at december  additionally  effective in may  the parent company filed a registration statement utilizing a shelf registration process 
under this shelf process  the parent company may offer up to million of any combination of the following securities  either separately or in units debt securities  preferred stock  depositary shares  common stock  and warrants 
in august  the parent company obtained million in a subordinated notes offering  bearing a fixed coupon rate and a year maturity 
at december   million was available under the shelf registration 
investment securities are an important tool to the corporation s liquidity objective 
as of december   all securities are classified as available for sale 
of the billion investment portfolio  billion were pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements  representing a lower cost source of funds 
the remaining securities could be pledged or sold to enhance liquidity if necessary 
the bank affiliates have a variety of funding sources in addition to key liquidity sources  such as core deposits  loan sales  loan repayments  and investment portfolio sales available to increase financial flexibility 
during  the four largest subsidiary banks associated bank illinois  national association  associated bank milwaukee  associated bank green bay  national association  and associated bank north established a billion bank note program 
as noted in the opening section of item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  during the second quarter of the corporation merged its wisconsin banks into a single national charter named associated bank  national association  thus  subsequently the program is available for use by associated bank illinois  national association and associated bank  national association 
under this program  short term and long term debt may be issued 
in april  associated bank  national association obtained million of variable rate notes that reprice quarterly at libor plus bp and bear a two year maturity 
as of december   billion was available 
the banks have also established federal funds lines with major banks totaling approximately billion and the ability to borrow approximately billion from the federal home loan bank billion was outstanding at december  
in addition  the bank affiliates also accept eurodollar deposits  issue institutional cds  and from time to time offer brokered cds 
through the normal course of operations  the corporation has entered into certain contractual obligations and other commitments 
such obligations generally relate to funding of operations through deposits or debt issuances  as well as leases for premises and equipment 
as a financial service provider the corporation routinely enters into commitments to extend credit 
while contractual obligations represent future cash requirements of the corporation  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans made by the corporation 
the following table summarizes significant contractual obligations and other commitments at december  table contractual obligations and other commitments operating time deposits long term debt leases total in thousands thereafter     total     commitments to extend credit  for the year ended december   net cash provided from financing activities was million  while operating and investing activities used net cash of  and million  respectively  for a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million since year end generally  during  time deposits matured that were not renewed primarily in brokered cds  while total asset growth since year end was moderate 
thus  other financing sources increased  particularly long term debt and other short term borrowings  to help replenish the net decrease in deposits and to provide for common stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends to the corporation s stockholders 
for the year ended december   net cash was provided from both operating and financing activities million and million  respectively  while investing activities used net cash of million  for a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million since year end generally  total assets grew modestly during  primarily in loans  and cash was also needed for payment of cash dividends and for common stock repurchases 
these needs were funded by increased deposits primarily brokered cds  net of deposits sold  and by proceeds from the sale of the credit card receivables 
during  proceeds from the sales and maturities of investment securities were predominantly reinvested by the corporation to mitigate interest rate risk and enhance future investment yields 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk arises from exposure to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  and other relevant market rate or price risk 
the corporation faces market risk in the form of interest rate risk through other than trading activities 
market risk from other than trading activities in the form of interest rate risk is measured and managed through a number of methods 
the corporation uses financial modeling techniques that measure the sensitivity of future earnings due to changing rate environments to measure interest rate risk 
policies established by the corporation s asset liability committee and approved by the corporation s board of directors limit exposure of earnings at risk 
general interest rate movements are used to develop sensitivity as the corporation feels it has no primary exposure to a specific point on the yield curve 
these limits are based on the corporation s exposure to a bp and bp immediate and sustained parallel rate move  either upward or downward 
interest rate risk in order to measure earnings sensitivity to changing rates  the corporation uses three different measurement tools static gap analysis  simulation of earnings  and economic value of equity 
the static gap analysis starts with contractual repricing information for assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet instruments 
these items are then combined with repricing estimations for administered rate interest bearing demand deposits  savings  and money market accounts and non rate related products demand deposit accounts  other assets  and other liabilities to create a baseline repricing balance sheet 
in addition to the contractual information  residential mortgage whole loan products and mortgage backed securities are adjusted based on industry estimates of prepayment speeds that capture the expected prepayment of principal above the contractual amount based on how far away the contractual coupon is from market coupon rates 
the following table represents the corporation s consolidated static gap position as of december  table interest rate sensitivity analysis december  interest sensitivity period total within days days days year over year total in thousands earning assets loans  held for sale    investment securities  at amortized cost       loans       other earning assets    total earning assets       interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits       other interest bearing      liabilities interest rate swaps   total interest bearing liabilities       interest sensitivity gap      cumulative interest sensitivity gap    month cumulative gap as a percentage of earning assets at december  the interest rate sensitivity assumptions for demand deposits  savings accounts  money market accounts  and interest bearing demand deposit accounts are based on current and historical experiences regarding portfolio retention and interest rate repricing behavior 
based on these experiences  a portion of these balances are considered to be long term and fairly stable and are therefore included in the over year category 
for analysis purposes  brokered cds of  have been included with other interest bearing liabilities and excluded from interest bearing deposits 
the static gap analysis in table provides a representation of the corporation s earnings sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
it is a static indicator that does not reflect various repricing characteristics and may not necessarily indicate the sensitivity of net interest income in a changing interest rate environment 
interest rate risk of embedded positions including prepayment and early withdrawal options  lagged interest rate changes  administered interest rate products  and cap and floor options within products require a more dynamic measuring tool to capture earnings risk 
earnings simulation and economic value of equity are used to more completely assess interest rate risk 
along with the static gap analysis  determining the sensitivity of short term future earnings to a hypothetical plus or minus and basis point parallel rate shock can be accomplished through the use of simulation modeling 
in addition to the assumptions used to create the static gap  simulation of earnings includes the modeling of the balance sheet as an ongoing entity 
future business assumptions involving administered rate products  prepayments for future rate sensitive balances  and the reinvestment of maturing assets and liabilities are included 
these items are then modeled to project net interest income based on a hypothetical change in interest rates 
the resulting net interest income for the next month period is compared to the net interest income amount calculated using flat rates 
this difference represents the corporation s earnings sensitivity to a plus or minus basis point parallel rate shock 
the resulting simulations for december   projected that net interest income would decrease by approximately of budgeted net interest income if rates rose by a basis point shock  and projected that net interest income would decrease by approximately of budgeted net interest income if rates fell by a basis point shock 
at december   the basis point shock up was projected to decrease net interest income by  and the basis point shock down projected that net interest income would increase by 
economic value of equity is another tool used to measure the impact of interest rates on the present value of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments 
this measurement is a longer term analysis of interest rate risk as it evaluates every cash flow produced by the current balance sheet 
the projected changes for earnings simulation and economic value of equity for both and were within the corporation s interest rate risk policy 
according to the interest rate risk tests discussed above  the corporation s sensitivity to interest rate changes decreased during this reduction in interest sensitivity came from changes in the mix of the balance sheet and the use of long term debt 
these results are based solely on immediate and sustained parallel changes in market rates and do not reflect the earnings sensitivity that may arise from other factors 
these factors may include changes in the shape of the yield curve  the change in spread between key market rates  or accounting recognition of the impairment of certain intangibles 
the above results are also considered to be conservative estimates due to the fact that no management action to mitigate potential income variances are included within the simulation process 
this action could include  but would not be limited to  delaying an increase in deposit rates  extending liabilities  using financial derivative products to hedge interest rate risk  changing the pricing characteristics of loans  or changing the growth rate of certain assets and liabilities 
the corporation uses interest rate derivative financial instruments as an asset liability management tool to hedge mismatches in interest rate exposure indicated by the net interest income simulation described above 
they are used to reduce the corporation s exposure to interest rate fluctuations and provide more stable spreads between loan yields and the rate on their funding sources 
in  the corporation executed million of new interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate risk 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate payments without the exchange of the underlying notional amount on which the interest payments are calculated 
table interest rate swap hedging portfolio notional balances and yield by maturity date maturity notional weighted average weighted average date amount rate received rate paid in thousands to hedge against rising interest rates  the corporation may use interest rate caps 
counterparties to these interest cap agreements pay the corporation based on the notional amount and the difference between current rates and strike rates 
at december   there were million of interest rate caps outstanding  which have a six month libor strike of 
to hedge against falling interest rates  the corporation may use interest rate floors 
like caps  counterparties to interest rate floor agreements pay the corporation based on the notional amount and the difference between current rates and strike rates 
there were no floors outstanding at december  derivative financial instruments are also discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
capital stockholders equity at december   increased to billion or per share  compared with million or per share at the end of stockholders equity is also described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in stockholders equity in was primarily composed of retention of earnings and the exercise of stock options  with offsetting decreases to stockholders equity from the payment of cash dividends and the repurchase of common stock 
additionally  stockholders equity at year end included million of accumulated other comprehensive income  predominantly related to unrealized gains on securities available for sale  net of the tax effect

the adequacy of the corporation s capital is regularly reviewed to ensure that sufficient capital is available for current and future needs and is in compliance with regulatory guidelines 
the assessment of overall capital adequacy depends on a variety of factors  including asset quality  liquidity  stability of earnings  changing competitive forces  economic condition in markets served  and strength of management 
as of december  and  the corporation s tier risk based capital ratios  total risk based capital tier and tier ratios  and tier leverage ratios were in excess of regulatory minimum and well capitalized requirements

the increase in the total risk based capital ratio for compared to is primarily attributable to the subordinated debt issued in which qualifies as tier supplementary capital for regulatory purposes 
capital ratios are included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the board of directors has authorized management to repurchase shares of the corporation s common stock each quarter in the market  to be made available for issuance in connection with the corporation s employee incentive plans and for other corporate purposes 
the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares  shares per quarter in and of these authorizations  approximately  shares were repurchased for million during with  shares reissued in connection with stock options exercised  and  shares were repurchased for million in with  shares reissued for options exercised 
additionally  under two separate actions in  the board of directors authorized the repurchase and cancellation of the corporation s outstanding shares  not to exceed approximately million shares on a combined basis 
under these authorizations  shares were repurchased for million during  at an average cost of per share  while approximately million shares remain authorized to repurchase at december  the repurchase of shares will be based on market opportunities  capital levels  growth prospects  and other investment opportunities 
shares repurchased and not retired are held as treasury stock and  accordingly  are accounted for as a reduction of stockholders equity 
management believes that a strong capital position is necessary to take advantage of opportunities for profitable geographic and product expansion  and to provide depositor and investor confidence

fourth quarter results net income for fourth quarter q was million  million higher than the million earned in the fourth quarter of q 
roe was  bp higher than q  while roa increased basis points to 
taxable equivalent net interest income for q was million  million higher than q the predominant factor impacting net interest income and net interest margin was the differing interest rate environment between the comparable quarters 
the average fed funds rate for q was bp lower than the comparable quarter last year  with rates steadily declining during q versus level during q the million increase in net interest income was principally attributable to rate  with a bp rise in net interest margin increasing net interest income by approximately million and changes in balance sheet growth and mix adding approximately million of additional net interest income 
for q  net interest margin was compared to in q the rate on interest bearing liabilities decreased bp to due principally to repricing of deposit products and wholesale funds in the lower interest rate environment 
the yield on earning assets  which are slower to reprice  dropped bp to in q the net result was an bp increase in interest rate spread 
the increase in spread was offset in part by an bp reduction in net free funds contribution 
average earning asset growth up million to billion and decreases in interest bearing deposits down billion were funded primarily with other wholesale funds up million 
to take advantage of the lower interest rate environment  the corporation increased the levels of long term debt by replacing short term funding balances throughout with million of subordinated debt  million of bank notes  and longer term federal home loan bank advances 
the provision for loan losses of million in q was up million from q  as more was provided in due to declines in asset quality related to the weakening economy and its impact on borrowers  and increased risk in the portfolio 
noninterest income in q was million higher than the comparable quarter in mortgage banking revenue was up million  more than triple  to million 
record high secondary mortgage production million in q versus million in q and favorable pricing led to increased gains on sales up million and higher production related fees 
service charges on deposit accounts were up million  principally from higher service charges on business accounts 
gains on the sale of assets was up million  due predominantly to the net premium on deposits from a branch sale in q revenue decreases occurred in trust service fees  down million due to the deterioration in market conditions and  correspondingly  to lower portfolio valuations  while other income was down million  attributable to the million settlement recorded in q for the corporation s mid year change in data processing vendors 
the remaining noninterest income categories collectively decreased million or from the same period last year 
noninterest expense between the comparable quarters was up million 
personnel expense was million higher  with salaries and related expenses up million and fringe benefits up million 
the increase in salaries was due primarily to higher base salaries in and higher bonuses and incentives 
the increase in fringe benefits was primarily attributable to higher profit sharing expenses and higher health insurance coverage costs 
mortgage servicing rights expense increased by million  primarily the result of million additional valuation reserve recorded on the servicing portfolio given the lower fair value of mortgage servicing rights due to the rate environment and the acceleration of prepayments between the periods

sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
sfas requires companies to separately report discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less costs to sell
