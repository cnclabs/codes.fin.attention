item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
general the company operates on a week fiscal year ending on the sunday closest to june th 
this period is utilized because it closely coincides with the rice crop year in the southern united states and rice is the largest component of the company s business 
both fiscal and fiscal covered weeks of operations whereas fiscal covered weeks of operations 
the company operates in various foreign countries and is therefore subject to currency fluctuations 
changes in the value of the united states dollar against these currencies will affect the company s results of operations and financial position 
when the united states dollar strengthens compared to other local currencies  the operating results of the company s foreign units translate into fewer united states dollars  thus decreasing the revenues and expenses of the company on a consolidated basis 
if the united states dollar weakens against the other relevant currencies  the opposite occurs 
the company s foreign units attempt to minimize the effects of currency risk by borrowing externally in the local currency and by hedging their purchases made in foreign currencies when that option is available 
as a matter of policy  the company does not engage in currency speculation 
changes in exchange rates historically have not materially impacted the company s net sales  costs or business practices and management expects this to continue 
inflationary conditions in the united states and europe have been moderate and have not had a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position for the three fiscal years ended june  despite higher inflationary rates in central america  inflation has not had a material impact on the results of operations or financial position of the company s units located in that region because the company has generally been able to pass on cost increases to its customers 
the company includes in domestic operations all export sales originating from the united states and sales in puerto rico 
accounting policies the following accounting policies are integral to understanding the financial statements contained herein reporting the operating results and financial position of the company for the year ended june  with comparative results for the previous year 
for additional accounting policies  see item  note  summary of significant accounting policies 
accounting estimates and assumptions certain estimates and assumptions are used in preparing the financial statements presented herein and affect the reported amounts and disclosures 
estimates are used when accounting for certain consumer and trade promotions  depreciation and amortization  employee benefits contingencies and asset valuation allowances 
for example  in determining the expense related to consumer coupons  the company estimates the percentage of coupons that will be redeemed based on historical results for similar items 
the company is also subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to be different from estimated results such as changes in market conditions  competition  foreign exchange rates  legislation  accounting rules and litigation 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
those items are discussed in more detail in the section entitled forward looking information and factors that may affect future results 
revenue recognition sales are recognized at the time the risk of ownership passes to the customer 
generally this occurs when products are shipped to trade customers 
on sales where the risk of ownership transfers upon delivery to the customer  sales are recorded when delivery occurs 
sales incentives certain sales incentives such as coupons  rebates and free products which are offered to either the retail trade or the consumer are recorded as a reduction in sales revenue in accordance with recent accounting pronouncements at the later of either the date the related revenue is recorded or the date at which the sales incentive is offered 
cash discounts an estimate of cash discounts offered to customers for early payment of sales invoices is recorded in the same period the related sales are recorded 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts in the normal course of business the company extends credit to its customers 
the company regularly reviews these accounts and makes a provision for amounts that may become uncollectible 
the company regularly evaluates accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical loss experience  specific problem accounts and general economic conditions in its geographic markets  and adjustments to the allowance are charged or credited to income 
although the company believes the allowance is adequate to provide for potential uncollectible accounts at june   there is a possibility that actual losses will differ from the amount estimated 
contingencies the company is subject to certain contingencies including but not limited to legal issues  and claims covering product liability  environmental  tax and employment matters 
the company records accruals for such contingencies based on its assessment of the probability of occurrence and an estimate of the potential liability 
in arriving at the liability to be recorded  it considers past history  where applicable  and the available facts surrounding each issue 
reserves are provided if the company thinks it likely that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to the position taken by the company or one of its subsidiaries 
see item  note  commitments and contingencies 
forward looking information and factors that may affect future results the securities and exchange commission encourages the disclosure of forward looking information in order for investors to better understand the company and enable more informed investment decisions 
from time to time the company does make oral and written statements that contain forward looking statements 
the company tries to identify such statements with the use of words such as estimate  expect  project  intend  plan  believe  and other similar terms 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following changes in business  political and worldwide economic conditions competitive market activity change in product mix sold trade buying patterns litigation interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations governmental laws and regulations including tax laws change in generally accepted accounting policies acts of god affecting manufacturing and distribution channels acquisitions  divestitures and restructurings the company cannot guarantee that any forward looking statement will be realized  but makes every effort to be prudent in its plans and assumptions 
should known or unknown risks materialize  or should underlying assumptions be inaccurate  actual results may vary materially from those estimated or projected 
the company does not undertake to publicly update forward looking statements as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
this discussion of factors that could affect future results is not meant to be complete but instead is designed to highlight important factors that may impact the company s future results
