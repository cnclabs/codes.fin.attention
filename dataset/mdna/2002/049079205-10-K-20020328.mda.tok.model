introduction the company s revenues and income from operations are derived principally from the operations of its telephone subsidiary  gt t 
gt t has derived most of its revenues from international telephone services 
in  the fcc issued a report and order setting maximum international settlement rates for telecommunications traffic between the us and many countries 
this order became effective with respect to traffic between the us and guyana on january  and required that from that date the settlement rate for traffic between the us and guyana be reduced from 
per minute to 
per minute 
the international settlement rate is the amount which gt t receives from us carriers for inbound traffic from the united states and which gt t pays to us carriers for traffic from guyana to the united states 
since the volume of inbound traffic from the united states to guyana is traditionally times the volume of outbound traffic from guyana to the united states  the reduction in the international settlement rate for us guyana traffic is currently having an adverse impact on gt t s operating profits 
gt t also has significantly more inbound than outbound traffic from several other countries where the current settlement rates for traffic to and from guyana are higher than 
per minute 
gt t anticipates that  over time  international settlement rates generally will decline 
on december   gt t filed an application with the guyana puc seeking additional local revenues in light of the reduction in international settlement rates for us guyana traffic 
on february   the puc issued an order awarding gt t an interim rate increase of about in gt t s rates for local service  which have been the lowest in the western hemisphere  and reducing gt t s rate for outbound calls from guyana to the us by approximately 
the puc indicated that it would continue to hold hearings on the appropriate permanent increase in rates with the objective of establishing permanent rates by june the puc s interim rate order is designed to increase gt t s revenues from local service by about million per year 
at the date of this report  the reduction in us guyana settlement rates has not resulted in any apparent reduction in the prices paid by consumer s calls from the us to guyana 
accordingly  the volume of traffic from the us to guyana has remained about the same as last year 
at the current level of traffic  the settlement rate reduction is costing gt t about million per month in reduced operating profits 
gt t expects that  as the reduced settlement rates are reflected in lower consumer prices in the us  increased volumes of international traffic between the us and guyana  along with the increased rates for local services authorized by the guyana puc  should enable gt t to recover about half of these lost operating profits 
the government of guyana has announced its intention to introduce competition into guyana s telecommunications sector 
the changes under consideration include terminating the monopoly provisions of gt t s license with appropriate compensation to gt t  rebalancing rates so that the rates for each service represent the real economic cost of these services  and shifting rates from rate of return regulation to incentive rate cap regulation 
in february  gt t began negotiations with the government on these issues and all other outstanding issues between the company and the government 
the company s consolidated financial statements include in addition to gt t the subsidiaries and affiliate listed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the principal components of operating expenses for the company s telephone operations are plant specific operations expenses  plant non specific operations expenses  customer operations expenses  corporate operations expenses  international long distance expenses  taxes other than income taxes and general and administrative expenses 
these categories are consistent with fcc accounting practices 
plant specific operations expenses relate to support and maintenance of telephone plant and equipment and include vehicle expense  land and building expense  central office switching expense and cable and wire expense 
plant non specific operations expenses consist of depreciation charges for telephone plant and equipment and expenses related to telephone plant and network administration  engineering  power  materials and supplies  provisioning and plant network testing 
customer operations expenses relate to marketing  providing operator services for call completion and directory assistance  and establishing and servicing customer accounts 
corporate operations expenses include gt t s expenses for executive management and administration  corporate planning  accounting and finance  external relations  personnel  labor relations  data processing  legal services  procurement and general insurance 
international long distance expenses consist principally of charges from international carriers for outbound international calls from guyana and payments to audiotext providers from whom gt t derives international audiotext traffic 
taxes other than income taxes include gross receipts taxes  property taxes  and other miscellaneous taxes 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of parent company overheads and amortization 
for accounting purposes  the december split up transaction of the company into two separate publicly held companies the company and the emerging communications  inc was treated as a non pro rata split off of a business in which the split off entity is to be accounted for at fair value 
the company was considered to be the split off entity since emerging communications  inc had the greater market capitalization and greater asset value immediately after the transaction  retained more of the pre transaction top management of the company and had greater net income in accordingly  the balance sheet of the company at december  was adjusted to fair value as evidenced by the market capitalization of the company immediately after the consummation of the transaction 
this adjustment included an approximately million reduction in the company s consolidated net fixed assets  and an approximately million reduction in the company s consolidated stockholders equity 
the fair value adjustment reduced the carrying value on the company s consolidated financial statements of its fixed assets significantly below their historical cost and replacement value 
therefore  depreciation expense for periods after december  is not a reliable indicator of the company s cost of replenishing its assets 
the combined selected financial data included in this report have been derived from combined financial statements relating to atlantic tele network  inc s business and operations in guyana including its majority owned subsidiary  gt t  and atn s activities as the parent company of all of its subsidiaries during the year ended december  these combined financial statements do not reflect the fair valuation adjustment arising from the split up transaction 
moreover  the combined statement of operations includes interest income from indebtedness of subsidiaries which were transferred with such indebtedness to emerging communications  inc in the split up transaction and certain expenses for the period from may  to december  which were reimbursed by emerging communications  inc as part of the split up transaction 
critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies address such matters as revenue recognition  depreciation and asset impairment recognition 
while the estimates and judgments associated with the application of these policies may be affected by different assumptions or conditions  the company believes the estimates and judgments associated with the reported amounts are appropriate in the circumstances 
from the period from inception of gt t s operations through december   the majority of gt t s cash receipts and expenditures have been in us dollars or other hard currencies 
accordingly  the us dollar has been gt t s functional currency 
with the decline in international settlement rates  the expansion of gt t s cellular business and the increases that gt t has received and hopes to receive in its rates for local service  the guyana dollar may become gt t s functional currency in the future 
if this were to occur  a decline in value of the guyana dollar in relation to the us dollar would give rise to an adverse impact on the company s reported consolidated results of operations 
results of operations years ended december  and net income for was million  or per share basic and per share diluted  as compared to million  or per share  for net income for includes million of write offs  net of tax benefit which represents i million write off  net of tax benefit of million  of the company s equity interest in lightrade  ii million write off  net of tax benefit of million  for the company s interest in its subsidiary  atn haiti  and iii  net of tax benefit of  reserve against an advance made to a telecom company the company was looking at acquiring 
after excluding these charge offs  the company s net income would have been million or per share basic and per share diluted 
telephone operating revenues for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for an increase of million or 
this increase in revenues was primarily due to a million  or increase in local exchange revenues 
the increase of million in local exchange service revenues was a result of increased cellular revenue as cellular lines in service increased from  at december  to  at december   an increase of  or 
the balance of the increase in local exchange service revenues was a result of increased fixed access lines in service which rose from  at december  to  at december   an increase of  lines or 
international long distance revenues in were million essentially the same amount as in  as increases in revenues from inbound and outbound traffic  other than audiotext  offset an expected decline in audiotext traffic 
in  audiotext traffic was not a significant contributor to the company s revenues or operating profits 
operating expenses were million for as compared to million for this represents an increase of million or 
this increase was due principally to an increase in telephone operating expenses of million or and an increase in general and administrative of million or 
offsetting these increases was a decrease in international long distance expense of million or 
the million increase in telephone operating expense was primarily due to the increases in cellular lines in service  increased legal expense and increases in wages and electricity costs 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses was due to recognition of the  reserve  net of tax benefit  referred to above against an advance made to a telecom company that the company was looking at acquiring in  with the remaining increase attributable to legal and consulting expense 
the million decrease in international long distance expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in audiotext payments as minutes of audiotext decreased from million in to million in telephone operating expenses were approximately of telephone operating revenues in as compared to approximately of telephone operating revenues in other operations revenues and expenses represent the operations of atn haiti  transnet  wireless world  llc and atlantic tele center  inc  each of which had operating losses in the twelve months ended december  as has been mentioned elsewhere in this report  the company is in the process of curtailing the operations of atn haiti and transnet and is seeking to sell assets of these two entities 
losses from other operations were million for as compared to million for revenues of these operations were million for as compared to million for in  other operations included an impairment charge of million representing a write off of the company s remaining investment in atn haiti as of december  revenues of other operations were million for as compared to million for this resulted in an increase of  or  over  which were primarily attributable to additional revenues from wireless world as the cable television business was integrated after the purchase of antilles wireless cable tv on march  expenses of other operations were million for as compared to million for this resulted in increases of million  or over this increase in expenses was due to an increase of million in start up costs associated with the development of atlantic tele center  inc and a million increase in costs incurred at wireless world  llc 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of  at atn haiti as operations were reduced in anticipation of selling or closing this entity 
income from operations before interest expense  income taxes and minority interest for was million as compared to million for this represents a decrease of million or and is principally a result of the factors affecting revenues and operating expenses discussed above 
other income expense  net for included interest income and expense as well as the company s equity in the earnings of bermuda digital communications 
during the company took write offs of million  net of tax  to write off an equity interest in lightrade  inc  which is also included in other income expense  net 
the company s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the decrease in the effective tax rate was due to the tax effect of the write off at atn haiti which had previously incurred losses which had no tax benefit in previous years 
the minority interest in earnings consists primarily of the guyana government s interest in gt t 
years ended december  and telephone operating revenues for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for net income for was million  or per share  as compared to million  or per share  for operating results for includes  of revenue recognized from the settlement of a dispute with an international telecommunications carrier resulting in a net gain of  or 
per share 
after excluding this one time item  the company s core operating revenues and earnings for were million and million  respectively  or per share 
excluding the one time item in discussed above  core revenues in decreased by million or 
this decrease in revenues was attributable primarily to the decline in audiotext traffic through audiotext traffic declined to million minutes in as compared to million minutes in  a decline of million minutes 
offsetting the decrease in audiotext traffic  regular inbound international minutes increased from million minutes in to million minutes in this increase in regular inbound traffic resulted in an increase of million in revenue over local exchange service revenues increased by million or during as a result of increased cellular revenue and increased lines in service which rose to  at december  from  lines in service at december   an increase of  lines or 
international long distance inbound revenues other than audiotext increased to million in from million in excluding the  of revenue recognized from the settlement mentioned above  this represents an increase of million or and is due to the increase in inbound minutes of traffic mentioned above 
management believes that this increase in inbound telephone traffic other than audiotext is indirectly the result of the increase in temporary rates for outbound long distance traffic granted by the puc in early because a substantial portion of gt t s international traffic  other than audiotext  consists of personal calls between guyanese expatriates and their friends and families in guyana  management believes that an increase in rates for outbound calls results not only in a decrease in the volume of outbound calls but an increase in the volume of inbound calls 
international long distance outbound revenues increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or as traffic increased from million minutes to million minutes from to these increases in outbound traffic and the resultant revenues are due primarily to the increase in lines in service discussed above 
telephone operating expenses were million for as compared to million for this represents a decrease of million or in telephone operating expense 
this decrease was due principally to a decrease in audiotext traffic expense at gt t of million due to decreased traffic volumes 
offsetting this decrease was an increase of million in plant nonspecific operations due to increased operating expenses 
core telephone operating expenses were approximately of core telephone operating revenues in as compared to approximately of core telephone operating revenues in excluding from core operating revenues in the effects of the one time item discussed above 
other operations revenues and expenses represent the operations of atn haiti sa and wireless world  llc 
and were not material in and the company acquired a interest in digicom on june  and an additional in december of wireless world  llc 
commenced operations with the acquisition of vi access on october  effective march   wireless world acquired the assets and business of antilles wireless cable tv company antilles wireless 
antilles wireless held lmds and mmds licenses for the us virgin islands and provided wireless cable us services there

vi internet access business of cobex international inc  an internet service provider in the us virgin islands 
atc was engaged in pre operating activities and generated no revenues during the fourth quarter of income from operations before interest expense  income taxes and minority interest for was million as compared to million for this represents an increase of million or and is principally a result of the factors affecting revenues and operating expenses discussed above 
the company s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the minority interest in earnings consists primarily of the guyana government s interest in gt t 
regulatory and tax issues the company is involved in a number of regulatory and tax proceedings 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in this report 
a material and adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and future operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company believes its existing liquidity and capital resources are adequate to meet current operating and capital needs 
the company s primary source of funds at the parent company level is advisory fees and dividends from gt t 
the tax and regulatory issues discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report could have a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity 
gt t is not subject to any contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends 
the continued expansion of gt t s network is dependent upon the ability of gt t to purchase equipment with us dollars 
a portion of gt t s taxes in guyana may be payable in us dollars or other hard currencies 
as a result of the rate increases recently awarded to and currently sought by gt t and the order of the us fcc which reduced the settlement rate for us guyana traffic and the general trend toward lower international settlement rates  it is likely that an increasing portion of the company s revenues will be earned in guyana currency 
while there are no legal restrictions on the conversion of guyana currency into us dollars or other hard currencies  or on the expatriation of guyana currency or foreign currency from guyana  there is currently little liquidity in the foreign currency markets in guyana 
while the company believes that it has  and will continue to have  adequate cash flows denominated in hard currency to meet its current operating  debt service and capital requirements  there can be no assurance that gt t will be able to convert its guyana currency earnings into hard currency to meet such obligations 
at december   approximately million of the company s total cash balances consisted of balances denominated in guyana dollars 
from time to time the company explores opportunities to acquire communications properties or licenses in the caribbean and elsewhere 
such acquisitions may require external financing 
there can be no assurance as to whether  when or on what terms the company will be able to acquire any such businesses or licenses 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on its consolidated operations in any of the years through new accounting pronouncements there are a number of new accounting pronouncements which may apply to the company 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to minimal market risks 
although the majority of gt t s revenues and expenditures are currently transacted in us dollars or other hard currencies  the results of future operations nevertheless may be affected by changes in the value of the guyana dollar 
from february until early  the guyana dollar remained relatively stable at the rate of approximately to the us dollar 
in the guyana dollar declined in value to approximately to the us dollar 
it remained relatively stable at approximately that rate through from december   through december  the guyana dollar further declined in value to approximately to the us dollar 
through december   the value of the guyana dollar has remained stable at approximately to the us dollar 
the effect of the devaluation of the guyana dollar on the company s consolidated financial results has not been significant in the periods presented  except that  as is previously discussed in the comparison of and operating results  the company recognized a net gain of million in as a result of the devaluation of the guyana dollar during a substantial majority of the company s consolidated cash balances are kept in us dollar denominated short term investments  and gt t generally endeavors to maintain a balance between its guyana dollar cash deposits and local receivables which are denominated in guyana dollars  and its local tax and other payables which are also denominated in the guyana dollar 
under generally accepted international accounting principles  which  in the company s view  are statutorily applicable to the rate making process in guyana  gt t s functional currency has been the us dollar because the majority of gt t s revenues and expenditures has been transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  in the company s view  gt t is currently entitled to its agreed upon minimum return on rate base computed in us dollars on a us dollar historical cost rate base 
accordingly  devaluations of the guyana dollar should have had no long term impact on the value of gt t s earnings in us dollars 
the guyana public utility commission has not approved or disapproved this position of the company 
moreover  with the decline in international settlement rates and the increases which gt t hopes to have in local revenues  the guyana dollar may become gt t s functional currency at some time in the future
