item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following is a discussion of our results of operations and financial position for the periods described below 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
our discussion of our results of operations and financial condition includes various forward looking statements about our markets  the demand for our products and services and our future results 
these statements are based on certain assumptions that we consider reasonable 
our actual results may differ materially from those indicated forward looking statements 
we are the largest operator and developer of orthotic and prosthetic o p patient care centers in the united states 
orthotics is the design  fabrication  fitting and device maintenance of custom made braces and other devices such as spinal  knee and sports medicine braces that provide external support to treat musculoskeletal disorders 
musculoskeletal disorders are ailments of the back  extremities or joints caused by traumatic injuries  chronic conditions  diseases  congenital disorders or injuries resulting from sports or other activities 
prosthetics is the design  fabrication and fitting of custom made artificial limbs for patients who have lost limbs as a result of traumatic injuries  vascular diseases  diabetes  cancer or congenital disorders 
we have two segments  the o p patient care services segment  which generated approximately of our sales in  and the distribution of o p components segment  which accounted for of our sales 
the manufacture of finished o p products segment  which was sold on october   accounted for the remaining of our sales 
our operations are located in states and the district of columbia  with a substantial presence in california  florida  georgia  illinois  new york  ohio  pennsylvania and texas 
we generate net sales primarily from patient care services related to the fabrication  fitting and maintenance of o p devices 
during  we increased same center sales by over our sales growth in was also principally driven by same center sales growth in our existing practices 
prior to calendar our growth in net sales resulted primarily from an aggressive program of acquiring and developing o p patient care centers and secondarily from same center sales 
similarly  growth in our o p distribution business was attributable primarily to acquisitions 
at december   we operated patient care centers and three distribution facilities  down from and six  respectively  as of december   due to reductions relating to our performance improvement initiatives in we calculate cost of goods sold in accordance with the gross profit method 
we base the estimates used in applying the gross profit method on the actual results of the most recently completed fiscal year and other factors affecting cost of goods sold 
estimated cost of goods sold is adjusted when the annual physical inventory is taken and compiled  generally in the fourth quarter  and a new accrual rate is established 
our revenues and results of operations are affected by seasonal considerations 
the adverse weather conditions often experienced in certain geographical areas of the united states during the first quarter of each year  together with a greater degree of patients sole responsibility for their insurance deductible payment obligations during the beginning of each calendar year  have contributed to lower net sales during that quarter 
our fourth quarter is also adversely affected by weather and a significant number of holidays  the impact of which is somewhat offset by patients desire to use up insurance 
we believe that the expansion of our business through a combination of continued same center sales growth  which has averaged over the last five years  the addition of new facilities and a program of selective acquisitions is critical to the continued improvement in our profitability

the costs associated with the former novacare o p centers were recorded in connection with the purchase price allocation of that acquisition on july  the costs associated with our existing patient care centers were charged to operations during the third quarter of as of december   the planned reduction in work force had been completed and we closed all patient care centers that were identified for closure in lease payments on these closed patient care centers are expected to be paid through during the year ended december   management reversed million of the lease termination restructuring reserve as a result of favorable lease buyouts and subleasing activity 
in december  our management and the board of directors determined that additional performance improvement initiatives needed to be adopted 
in december  we retained jay alix associates to do an assessment of the opportunities available for improved financial and operating performance 
the first phase of their plan called for the termination of employees  for which we recorded million in severance costs during we then began  in january  to develop  with the assistance of jay alix associates  a comprehensive performance improvement program consisting of performance improvement initiatives aimed at improving cash collections  reducing working capital requirements and improving operating performance 
in connection with the implementation of these initiatives  we recorded in the second quarter of million in restructuring and asset impairment costs million expense offset by the above mentioned approximate million benefit

impairment loss on assets held for sale in connection with the analysis of our continuing business  we determined that the manufacture of orthotic and prosthetic components and devices was not one of our core businesses as it represented only of our net sales for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  in july  we agreed to the general terms of a sale of substantially all of the manufacturing assets of seattle orthopedic group  inc to united states manufacturing company for million 
the sale resulted in our recording  in the second quarter of  an asset impairment loss of million  as the net book value of the assets was million  while net proceeds from the sale of the assets were million 
performance improvement plan in january  we developed  with the assistance of our consultant  jay alix associates  a performance improvement plan which contained many initiatives that were designed to effect further cost savings through improved utilization and efficiency of support services  enhanced purchasing and inventory management  improved collection methods and consolidation of distribution services 
in addition  we are seeking to enhance net sales through improved marketing and branding initiatives and more efficient billing procedures

on february   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due senior notes in a private placement exempt from registration under the securities act of  as amended 
we also closed  concurrent with the senior notes  a new million senior secured revolving line of credit new revolving credit facility 
the proceeds from these transactions were used to retire the existing revolving line of credit  tranche a b term loans  and for fees related to the transaction 
the senior notes mature on february  and do not require any prepayments of principal prior to maturity 
interest on the senior notes accrued from february   and is payable semi annually on february and august of each year  commencing august  payment of principal and interest on the senior notes is guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by all of our current and future domestic subsidiaries 
on and after february   we may redeem all or part of the senior notes at of principal amount during the month period commencing on february   at of principal amount if redeemed during the month period commencing on february   and at of principal amount if redeemed on or after february  before february   we may redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes with the cash proceeds of certain equity offerings  provided that at least of the aggregate principal amount of senior notes remains outstanding after the redemption 
upon the occurrence of certain specified change of control events  unless we have exercised our option to redeem all the senior notes as described above  each holder of a senior note will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s senior notes at a purchase price in cash equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of repurchase 
the senior notes were issued under an indenture  dated as of february   with wilmington trust company  as trustee 
the indenture limits our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  create liens  pay dividends on or redeem capital stock  make certain investments  make restricted payments  make certain dispositions of assets  engage in transactions with affiliates  engage in certain business activities and engage in mergers  consolidations and certain sales of assets 
the new revolving credit facility  which was provided by a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions led by bnp paribas  is a senior secured revolving credit facility providing for loans of up to million and will terminate on february  borrowings under the new revolving credit facility will bear interest  at our option  at an annual rate equal to libor plus or the base rate as defined in the new revolving credit facility plus in each case  subject to adjustments based on financial performance 
our obligations under the new revolving credit facility are guaranteed by our subsidiaries and are secured by a first priority perfected security interest in our subsidiaries shares  all of our assets and all of the assets of our subsidiaries 
borrowings under the new revolving credit facility are prepayable at any time without premium or penalty 
the new revolving credit facility requires compliance with various financial covenants  including a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio  minimum consolidated ebitda  a maximum total leverage ratio  a maximum senior secured leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  as well as other covenants 
the new revolving credit facility contains customary events of default and is subject to various mandatory prepayments and commitment reductions 
we believe that  based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth  cash generated from operations  together with other available sources of liquidity  including borrowings available under the new revolving credit facility  will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund anticipated capital expenditures and make required payments of principal and interest on our debt  including payments due on the senior notes and obligations under the new revolving credit facility 
in addition  we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and expect to fund such acquisitions from our available sources of liquidity  as discussed above

we are exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the swap agreements 
critical accounting estimates the company s analysis and discussion of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
us gaap provides the framework from which to make these estimates  assumptions and disclosures 
the company chooses accounting policies within us gaap that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report the company s operating results and financial position in a consistent manner 
management regularly assesses these policies in light of current and forecasted economic conditions 
the company s accounting policies are stated in note b to the consolidated financial statements as presented elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the company believes the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
o revenue recognition revenues on the sale of orthotic and prosthetic devices and associated services to patients are recorded when the device is accepted by the patient 
revenues on the sale of orthotic and prosthetic devices to customers by our distribution segment are recorded upon the shipment of products  in accordance with the terms of the invoice 
deferred revenue represents deposits made prior to the final fitting and acceptance by the patient and unearned service contract revenue 
revenue is recorded at its net realizable value taking into consideration all governmental and contractual adjustments and discounts 
management regularly assesses the recoverability of the related amounts of receivable from the vendors that participate in the related cooperative advertising programs 
o inventories inventories  which consist principally of purchased parts and work in process  are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
the company calculates cost of goods sold in accordance with the gross profit method 
the company bases the estimates used in applying the gross profit method on the actual results of the most recently completed fiscal year and other factors affecting cost of goods sold during the current reporting periods 
estimated cost of goods sold during the period is adjusted when the annual physical inventory is taken 
management adjusts its reserve for inventory obsolescence whenever the facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying cost of certain inventory items are in excess of its market price 
o intangible assets excess cost over net assets acquired represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to net identifiable assets of purchased businesses and is amortized using the straight line method over years 
non compete agreements are recorded based on agreements entered into by the company and are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from to years using the straight line method 
the remainder of the intangible assets are recorded at cost and are amortized over their estimated useful lives of up to years using the straight line method 
whenever the facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these intangibles may not be recoverable  management reviews and assesses the future cash flows expected to be generated from the related intangible for possible impairment 
impairment is recognized by a charge to operating results and a reduction in the carrying value of the intangible asset 
new accounting standards on june   the fasb unanimously approved its proposed statements of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations  and no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas supercedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 business combinations 
the most significant changes made by sfas are requiring that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   establishing specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill  and requiring unallocated negative goodwill to be written of immediately as an extraordinary gain rather than being deferred and amortized 
the company did not have a material impact from the adoption of sfas on its financial statements as no acquisitions were made subsequent to june  sfas supercedes apb  intangible assets 
sfas primarily addresses accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition ie  the post acquisition accounting 
the provisions of sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas must be adopted at the beginning of a fiscal year 
the most significant changes made by sfas are goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized  goodwill will be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level  intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life will be tested for impairment at least annually  and the amortization period of intangible assets with finite lives will no longer be limited to forty years 
the company adopted sfas effective january  due to the application of the nonamortization provisions of sfas  annual amortization in the amount of million will no longer be recorded 
in addition  the company will reclassify an assembled workforce intangible asset with an unamortized balance of million along with a deferred tax liability of million to goodwill at the date of adoption 
the company will test goodwill for impairment using a two step process prescribed in sfas the first step is to identify or screen for potential impairment  while the second step is to measure the amount of the impairment  if any 
the company expects to perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  in the first quarter of any impairment charge resulting from these transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of the company is in the process of making the determinations as to what its reporting units are and what amounts of goodwill  intangible assets  other assets  and liabilities should be allocated to those reporting units 
the company has not yet determined what the effect of these tests  if any  will be on the earnings and financial position of the company 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
provides guidance on the accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and applies to all long lived assets including discontinued operations and consequently amends apb opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of segment of a business 
sfas no 
develops one accounting model based on the model in sfas no 
for long lived assts that are to be disposed of by sale  as well as addresses the principal implementation issues 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell 
the company does not expect sfas no 
to have a material effect on its financial statements 
other inflation has not had a significant effect on our operations  as increased costs to us generally have been offset by increased prices of products and services sold 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
we address this risk by using interest rate swaps from time to time 
at december  there were no interest rate swaps outstanding 
in march  the company entered into two fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million  as discussed in note h to hanger s consolidated financial statements
