the declining results of operations resulting in the inability to service the jp morgan loans was judged to represent an indication of possible impairment in the value of the properties which secure the loans 
in the third quarter of  the company estimated the current value of the six centers which secure the loans and concluded that the carrying value of four of the centers exceeds the fair values of those centers 
accordingly  the results of operations for the year ended december   include a provision for asset impairment of million  representing a write down of the carrying values of the assets to their estimated fair value in accordance with sfas no 
the aggregate carrying value of the real estate of such properties collateralizing the jp morgan loans approximates million at december  such value is exceeded by the current outstanding loan balances totaling million 
if the lender were to foreclose on the collateral properties in full satisfaction of the loans  the company would record an extraordinary gain for the difference between the carrying value of the properties and related net assets and the outstanding loan balances plus accrued interest and penalties 
the estimation of the fair value of the six centers securing the jp morgan loans involved estimates by management with respect to future cash flows  market conditions and valuations applicable to such properties

monthly debt service payments total  and it matures in january the company is required to keep the properties in good general repair and to make capital improvements and repairs to certain of its outlet centers pursuant to the terms of the hgp credit facility  greenwich loan and the jp morgan loans 
at december   there was approximately million deposited in escrows with cdc  greenwich  and jp morgan  which the company believes is sufficient to fund its ongoing capital requirements 
any additional capital improvements are expected to be funded with additional borrowings  existing cash balances or cash flow from operations 
the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements generally through additional borrowings or the extension of the maturity dates on its loans maturing in  working capital and cash flows from operations including the sale of land parcels reflected in real estate held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company expects to meet its long term requirements  such as tenant allowances for new leases and capital improvements and expansions currently being considered at its centers in tulare  california  and medford  minnesota  through the use of working capital and cash flows from operations and  if necessary and available  the additional borrowing of long term debt and the potential offering of equity securities in the private or public capital markets 
the company sold its center in dry ridge  kentucky  in january and refinanced its centers in norton shores  michigan  and holland  michigan  in july it extended the maturity date of the hgp credit facility until july it is currently seeking longer term replacement financing for the hgp credit facility and has also explored offers for the sale of some or all of its properties 
as a result of the current market conditions with respect to the financing of factory outlet centers  the company s relatively high leverage and its current default on the jp morgan loans  the company s ability to obtain additional financing is limited 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete such refinancing or on what terms such refinancing may be accomplished 
the financial statements have been prepared based on management s judgement that the company will meet its maturing loan obligations  either through refinancing or extending the terms of its maturing loans  from the sale of properties or a combination thereof 
if future events differ from this judgement  there would be a significant impact on the consolidated statements of operations of the company

historically  of expiring leases have renewed or remained in occupancy past their expiration  but not necessarily on equivalent economic terms 
an additional of leases which have expired are still under negotiation 
while the company does not currently believe that the proportion of leases scheduled to expire in  which will actually be renewed will differ materially from its historical experience  there can be no assurance that it will renew an equivalent proportion of such leases  nor that the economics of such renewals will be as favorable as those contained in the current leases 
real estate held for sale the company is actively marketing the land parcels which are listed on the consolidated balance sheet as real estate held for sale 
the net proceeds from the sale of these parcels would be available for general corporate purposes 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is associated with the hgp credit facility 
this facility had a balance of million at december  the facility matured in july of and was subsequently extended to july of the interest rate on the extended facility is equal to the day london interbank offered rate libor but not less than plus basis points

the company is working to mitigate this interest rate risk by seeking longer term  fixed rate refinancing of the facility 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete such refinancing or on what terms such refinancing may be accomplished 
the following table shows sensitivity of annual interest expense and net income per share diluted based on an increase in the libor rate of above the floor of 
principal amount change in libor rate change in interest expense per share diluted inflation hgp s leases with some of its tenants require the tenants to reimburse hgp for most operating expenses and increases in common area maintenance expense  which reduces hgp s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation

while any litigation contains an element of uncertainty  management believes the losses  if any  resulting from such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements of the company
