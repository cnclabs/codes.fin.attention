general the company operates on a to week fiscal year ending on the last saturday in february and fiscal ended on february  the company has derived substantially all of its revenues from the rendering of services and the sale or supply of computerized online lottery systems and components to government authorized lotteries 
service revenues have been derived primarily from lottery service contracts 
these contracts are typically at least five years in duration  and generally provide compensation to the company based upon a percentage of a lottery s gross online lottery sales 
these percentages vary depending on the size of the lottery and the scope of services provided to the lottery 
product sale revenues have been derived primarily from the installation of new online lottery systems  installation of new software and sales of lottery terminals and equipment in connection with the expansion of existing lottery systems 
the company s gross margins on product sales fluctuate depending on the mix  volume and timing of product sales contracts 
the size and timing of these transactions have resulted in variability in product sale revenues from period to period 
the company currently anticipates that product sales during fiscal will be in a range of million to million 
the company has taken steps to broaden its offerings of high volume transaction processing services outside of its core business of providing online lottery services 
for example  in may and december  the company entered into agreements that permit bill payments over its brazilian and chilean networks  respectively 
the company s business is highly regulated  and the competition to secure new government contracts is often intense 
awards of contracts to the company are  from time to time  challenged by competitors 
further  there have been and may continue to be investigations of various types  including grand jury investigations  conducted by governmental authorities into possible improprieties and wrongdoing in connection with efforts to obtain and or the awarding of lottery contracts and related matters 
in light of the fact that such investigations frequently are conducted in secret  the company would not necessarily know of the existence of an investigation that might involve the company 
because the company s reputation for integrity is an important factor in its business dealings with lottery and other government agencies  if government authorities were to make an allegation of  or if there were to be a finding of  improper conduct on the part of or attributable to the company in any matter  such an allegation or finding could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  including its ability to retain existing contracts and to obtain new or renewal contracts 
in addition  continuing adverse publicity resulting from these investigations and related matters could have such a material adverse effect 
see note f to the consolidated financial statements  part i  item  certain factors that may affect future performance and part i  item legal proceedings herein for further information concerning these matters and other contingencies 
the company is a global business and derives a substantial portion of its revenues from operations outside of the united states 
in particular  in fiscal  the company derived approximately of its revenues from its international operations and of its revenues from its brazilian operations alone including of its revenues from the national lottery of brazil  one of the company s largest customers 
in addition  a substantial portion of the company s assets are held outside of the united states 
upcoming significant contract rebids a majority of the company s revenues and cash flow is derived from its portfolio of long term online lottery service contracts  each of which in the ordinary course of the company s business periodically is the subject of competitive procurement or renegotiation 
through fiscal which ends in february  three of the company s larger contracts  as measured by annual revenues  will be the subject of competitive procurements to select contractors to supply lottery goods and services upon the termination of the company s current contracts 
among these is the national lottery of brazil  one of the company s largest contracts  which accounted for of the company s consolidated revenues in fiscal the company believes  upon the expiration of the company s current contract  that caixa economica federal  the operator of brazil s national lottery  is likely to attempt to handle internally some non lottery operations currently performed by the company under its contract and  with regard to the remaining lottery operations  may seek to proceed with a competitive procurement process calculated to result in multiple vendors to administer brazil s national lottery  which is presently administered solely by the company 
other large contracts that will be subject to competitive procurement through fiscal include the california and georgia lottery contracts 
see part i  item certain factors that may affect future performance the company s lottery operations are dependent upon its continued ability to retain and extend its existing contracts and win new contracts and lottery contract awards and related significant developments herein for further information concerning these matters 
critical accounting policies recently  the securities and exchange commission issued new advice regarding disclosure of critical accounting policies 
in response to this advice  the company has identified the accounting policies listed below that the company believes are most critical to the company s financial condition and results of operations  and that require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties 
this section should be read in conjunction with note a to the consolidated financial statements which includes other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company recognizes service revenues as the services are performed 
liquidated damages which equaled  and of the company s total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively are recorded as a reduction in revenue in the period in which it is determined that they are probable and estimable 
revenues from product sales or sales type leases are recognized when installation is complete and the customer accepts the product when acceptance is a stipulated contractual term 
in those instances where the company is not responsible for installation  revenue is recognized when the product is shipped 
amounts received from customers in advance of revenue recognition are deferred as liabilities 
generally  product sales under long term contracts are recorded over the contractual period under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting  sales and estimated gross profit are recognized as work is completed and accepted by the customer by utilizing the most recent estimates of cost to complete 
sales and gross profit are adjusted prospectively for revisions in estimated total contract costs during the period in which the information necessary to make the adjustment becomes available 
if the current contract estimate indicates a loss  provision is made for the estimated loss when it becomes known and quantifiable 
the completed contract method of accounting is used for long term contracts in those circumstances under which estimated costs to complete the delivery cannot be reasonably estimated or when the contract stipulates the entire balance due under the contract is refundable if the product is not accepted by the customer 
under the completed contract method of accounting  product sales are recorded when the company has substantially completed its obligations under the contract 
at february   the company had advance payments from customers of approximately million  including amounts received from two customers in europe whose lottery systems are online and selling lottery tickets 
the company currently expects to record product sales related to these two customers in fiscal upon receipt of final acceptance letters 
receivables and inventory reserves the company evaluates the collectibility of trade accounts and sales type lease receivables on a customer by customer basis and believes its reserves are adequate  however  if economic circumstances change significantly resulting in a major customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to the company  original estimates of the recoverability of amounts due the company could be reduced by significant amounts requiring additional reserves 
inventories include amounts related to the company s long term service contracts and product sales contracts  including product sales under long term contracts  and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is made based on management s analysis of inventory levels and future sales forecasts 
the company believes its reserves are adequate  however  should future sales forecasts change  the company s original estimates of obsolescence could increase by a significant amount requiring additional reserves 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible and long lived assets the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as declines in revenues  earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the economic stability of a particular country indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company s goodwill is not considered impaired based on management s estimates of future cash flows applying the current accounting standards 
if facts and circumstances were to indicate that the company s long lived assets might be impaired  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the long lived assets would be compared to their carrying amounts to determine if a write down to fair value is necessary

market risk disclosures the primary market risk inherent in the company s financial instruments and exposures is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates 
the company s exposure to commodity price changes is not considered material and is managed through its procurement and sales practices 
the company did not own any marketable equity securities during fiscal interest rates interest rate market risk is estimated as the potential change in the fair value of the company s total debt or current earnings resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates 
at february   after taking into consideration million of interest rate swaps  the estimated fair value of the company s million of fixed rate senior notes approximated million 
a hypothetical adverse or favorable change in interest rates applied to the fixed rate senior notes would not have a material effect on current earnings 
an independent investment banker determined the estimated fair value amounts 
at february   the estimated fair value of the company s million principal amount of convertible debentures approximated million 
at february   a hypothetical increase in interest rates would increase the estimated fair value of the convertible debentures to million and a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would reduce the estimated fair value of the convertible debentures to million

an independent investment banker determined the estimated fair value amounts 
foreign currency exchange rates foreign exchange exposures arise from current and anticipated transactions denominated in currencies other than the company s functional currency united states dollars and from the translation of foreign currency balance sheet accounts into united states dollar balance sheet accounts 
the company seeks to manage its foreign exchange risk by securing payment from its customers in united states dollars  by sharing risk with its customers  by utilizing foreign currency borrowings  by leading and lagging receipts and payments and by entering into foreign currency exchange and option contracts 
in addition  a significant portion of the costs attributable to the company s foreign currency revenues are payable in the local currencies 
whenever possible  the company negotiates clauses into its contracts that allow for price adjustments should a material change in foreign exchange rates occur 
the company  from time to time  enters into foreign currency exchange and option contracts to reduce the exposure associated with current transactions and anticipated transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
however  the company does not engage in currency speculation 
at february  and february   a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in a translation loss of million and million  respectively  that would be recorded in the equity section of the company s consolidated balance sheet 
at february  and february   a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in a net transaction loss of million and million  respectively  that would be recorded in current earnings after considering the effects of foreign exchange contracts currently in place 
at february   a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in a net reduction of cash flows from anticipatory transactions in fiscal of million 
comparatively  at february   a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would have resulted in a net reduction of cash flow from anticipatory transactions of million in fiscal  largely as a result of anticipated cash flows from the company s customer in the united kingdom
