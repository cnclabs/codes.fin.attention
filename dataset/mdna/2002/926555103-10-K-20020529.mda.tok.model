crt division segment sales increased  or over fiscal while the wholesale parts segment declined  or 
the net increase in crt segment sales can be attributed to growth within the monitor subsegment  primarily at display systems and lexel 
these locations added  and  respectively to fiscal sales 
the offsetting declines are primarily attributed to the decline in revenues in the entertainment subsegment and declines at the aydin and z axis locations 
the monitor division increased  or  data display crt sales increased  or  entertainment crt sales decreased  or  and the electron gun component parts segment decreased  or 
the increase in monitor division sales was impacted in several ways 
the lexel operations integrated the fiscal acquisitions of ist and raytheon product lines  which contributed approximately  in additional sales in fiscal  and streamlined processes to allow for better delivery times  thereby decreasing the amount of backlog 
the successful integration of the acquired product lines into the lexel facility were not completed until late in the fourth quarter of fiscal offsetting sales declines in the monitor division occurred at aydin and z axis in the amount of approximately  aydin s government sales were down slightly due to completion of pre existing contracts  which were not replaced at the same rate with new contracts 
commercial sales of monitors were negatively impacted as well 
certain customers had been lost during the previous year s change of production facilities from aydin to z axis 
additionally  there has been a slight impact as some commercial customers have changed to flat panel technology 
in november  displays systems in florida began shipping the marquee product line acquired from christie and recognized sales of  from this product line during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal the company is the primary supplier of replacement crts to the entertainment market 
a majority of the entertainment segment s sales are to major television retailers as replacements for products sold under manufacturer and extended warranties 
due to the economics of lower retail sales prices for mid size television sets to  fewer extended warranties are sold 
the company remains the primary supplier of the manufacturer s standard warranties 
growth in this division will be impacted by the timing and number of extended warranties sold for the larger  more expensive sets 
due to the fact that the company is in the replacement market  it has the ability to track retail sales trends and accordingly  can adjust quantities of certain size crts carried in stock and reduce the exposure to obsolescence 
flat panel technology has not had an impact on the television replacement market 
most of the flat panel units sold within the television market are for commercial usage rather than end user consumer usage 
within the data display and monitor subsegments  there has been an impact by flat panel technology 
the company has made adjustments internally and several of the subsidiaries within these subsegments currently produce flat panel products 
as noted above  being in the replacement market  the company has the ability to see product trends and make marketing  production and stocking decisions based on those trends 
the decline in the wholesale consumer parts segment of  is attributed primarily to the decline in consumer retail sales during the comparative periods 
sales to larger distributors have declined slightly as well 
general economic conditions have had a direct  negative impact on this segment 
to help offset these declines  fox international signed a distribution agreement in fiscal with applica  inc applica  authorizing fox international to distribute parts and accessories for applica s black decker toaster oven  profinish  quick easy  and spacemaker product lines 
sales earned pursuant to this agreement were  in fiscal gross margins consolidated gross margins increased from to for the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february  crt division margins increased from to and wholesale electronic parts division margins increased from to for the same comparative period 
the increase in margins within the crt division resulted from increases in sales volume at lexel and display systems while manufacturing overhead remained stable 
margins at lexel increased from to  or  display system s gross margins increased in dollars by  while its gross margin percentage remained essentially flat 
additionally  margins have improved in the data display subsegment as sales of higher margin high resolution color tubes have increased in comparison to lower margin monochrome tubes 
margins in the wholesale consumer parts segment have increased due primarily to higher margins obtained on black decker distribution sales 
additionally  margins have improved on sales to this segment s primary electronics retailer 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased from for the year ended february  to for the year ended february  the crt division operating expenses increased  for the year ended february  as compared to february  included in these increases were expenses within the monitor subsegment for the new california operations of  that were not present in the previous year 
also  expenses increased at display systems by  due to the increase in business with the christie product line

included in the crt division expenses for fiscal was a  write down of a note receivable 
the wholesale consumer parts segment increased operating expenses  in the year ended february  as compared to a year ago 
this segment incurred costs to shut down its warehouse in solon  ohio and to open a warehouse in new york for the black decker product line 
additionally  when fox international acquired the black decker distribution agreement with applica  there were outstanding coupon offers the company had to honor that included free shipping 
the segment s delivery expense increased  despite an overall decrease in sales 
the company believes that the majority of these coupons have been utilized and  going forward  that fox international will be able to charge its customers for shipping costs related to this product line 
in fiscal  management expects certain operating expenses to decline as a result of steps taken to reduce costs at its mexican subsidiary 
the monthly lease on the operating facility has been decreased by  per month  while anticipated headcount reductions of approximately employees  once fully implemented  will provide additional savings of  per month 
interest expense interest expense decreased  to  for the comparative fiscal periods due primarily to decreases in variable interest rates through fiscal a gradual decrease throughout the period at rates from to was realized on the company s primary line of credit 
the notes payable to officer have interest rates of prime plus  which varied from to during fiscal  and libor plus  respectively  which varied from to during fiscal the company s debt levels increased in fiscal  which can be attributed primarily to the increase in the primary line of credit from  to  and the increase in notes payable to an officer of  relating to the christie product line acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal is as compared to for fiscal the decrease in the effective rate is attributable to higher income before income taxes in compared to  as expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes remained relatively constant

fiscal compared to fiscal net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal increased  or over fiscal net sales 
crt division segment sales increased  or over fiscal while the wholesale parts segment declined  or 
within the crt segment  data display crt sales increased  or  entertainment crt sales decreased  or  the electron gun component parts segment decreased  or  and the monitor division increased  or 
the net increase in crt division sales was primarily attributed to growth within the monitor segment 
the company s newest locations within this segment  display systems in florida and lexel in kentucky  contributed  and  respectively  for the year ended february  excluding these sales  overall crt division sales were down  with data display and electron gun component parts sales being relatively flat  the decline excluding new locations was attributed primarily to the entertainment and monitor divisions 
the company is the primary supplier of replacement crts to the entertainment market 
due to the continued decrease in retail sales prices of mid size television sets to  declines in extended warranty sales by major television retailers continued to occur 
in turn  the company s entertainment division sales were negatively impacted as a majority of their sales within this division are for warranty related repairs 
extended warranties on the larger size television sets and up were anticipated to increase both in volume and dollars as the demand for these sets have increased and the crt costs are more expensive than the smaller sized sets 
the company continued to supply manufacturer warranty replacements in the smaller size range up to 
additionally  being in the replacement market  the company has the ability to track retail sales trends 
accordingly  the company adjusted quantity levels of crt sizes thereby reducing the impact of obsolete inventory exposure 
flat panel technology has not had an impact on the television replacement market 
most of the flat panel units sold within the television market are for commercial usage rather than end user consumer usage 
within the data display and monitor subsegments  there was an impact by flat panel technology 
the company made adjustments internally and several of the subsidiaries within these subsegments began producing flat panel products 
as noted above  being in the replacement market  the company has the ability to see product trends and make marketing  production and stocking decisions based on those trends 
the monitor division sales  net of sales at the newest locations  declined  from the same period a year ago 
sales within the monitor segment included military contracts  which vary from year to year 
while the company did not lose a military contract in the past year  the completed contracts were not immediately being replaced with new contracts 
additionally  during the transition of manufacturing processes between aydin and z axis during fiscal  the company lost business to competitors within the commercial market 
the transition was done so that aydin could focus primarily on ruggedized monitors used for military applications and z axis could continue to focus on the commercial monitor market 
extended lead times during the transition period caused former aydin commercial customers to seek other procurement alternatives 
z axis took steps to address these issues and was successful in reducing lead times 
the company also allocated marketing personnel to these areas in an attempt to reclaim the lost sales 
the decline in the wholesale consumer parts segment of  was attributed primarily to the sale of vanco international vanco in september vanco had sales of  for the year ended february  gross margins consolidated gross margins decreased from to for the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february  crt division margins decreased from to and wholesale electronic parts division margins decreased from to for the same comparative period 
the decline in margins within the crt division resulted from the increases in the monitor segment due to the company s recent acquisition  lexel  whose gross margin rates were lower than the other crt division locations 
lexel s reduced margins were a reflection of higher quality requirements  including more expensive materials and increased labor demanded by the products intended use 
these uses include military applications 
also included in the reduced margins were costs incurred due to the integration of the ist business acquired in june into the lexel facility 
the company incurred additional expenses in the fourth quarter with the incorporation of the raytheon and anacomp businesses into lexel  but on a much smaller scale than the ist integration 
the wholesale consumer parts division margins were down in part due to the exclusion of vanco in fiscal additionally  there were declines in margins realized on the fire and safety product line as selling prices were reduced to move some older  slower moving merchandise 
lastly  margins on the increased volume sales to the major electronics distributor are lower than to other retail customers 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased from for the year ended february  to for the year ended february  the crt division operating expenses increased  for the year ended february  as compared to february  included in these increases were expenses for the new florida and kentucky operations of  that were not present in the previous year 
additionally  included in the crt division expenses for fiscal was a  write down of a note receivable 
the company held an unsecured note receivable as a result of a litigation settlement 
the note had an original face value of  due in monthly installments of  over a term of months 
during  monthly payments on the note were delinquent and payments made were less than the required contractual amounts 
payments eventually ceased in the fourth quarter of as of february   the company believed that it was probable that they would be unable to collect any of the outstanding amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement and considered the loan impaired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditor s of impairment of a loan  the company wrote off the remaining  balance of the note 
the wholesale consumer parts division reduced operating expenses  in the year ended february  as compared to a year ago 
included in this reduction was the elimination of operating expenses from vanco of  additionally  fox international reduced its operating expenses by approximately  by eliminating two locations and reducing personnel at its headquarter location in cleveland  ohio 
also  reductions in delivery expense of  incurred as a result of more cost effective packaging and a switch by fox international to a more cost competitive shipping provider 
interest expense interest expense increased  to  for the comparative fiscal period due to increases in overall debt and changes in variable interest rates through fiscal the increase in debt can be attributed primarily to the increase in the primary line of credit from  to  the  loan in conjunction with the lexel acquisition  and the increase in notes payable to an officer of  relating to the ist acquisition 
the primary line was a gradual increase throughout the period at a fixed rate of 
the lexel acquisition loan was funded in may and has an interest rate based on libor plus up to

decreases in customer advances received in the prior fiscal year accounted for a reduction in cash of  as a significant portion of the related crts were manufactured and shipped to customers in fiscal the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was due to a reduction in trade accounts payable in the comparative periods  due primarily to a reduction in fourth quarter purchasing

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
the accounting policies that may involve a higher degree of judgments  estimates  and complexity include reserves on inventories  the allowance for bad debts and warranty reserves 
the company uses the following methods and assumptions in determining its estimates reserves on inventories reserves on inventories result in a charge to operations when the estimated net realizable value declines below cost 
management regularly reviews the company s investment in inventories for declines in value and establishes reserves when it is apparent that the expected realizable value of the inventory falls below its original cost 
the age of the inventory is not as significant as is the projected demand for crts 
management is able to identify consumer buying trends  such as size and application  well in advance of supplying replacement crts 
thus  the company is able to adjust inventory stocking levels according to the projected demand 
the average life of a crt is five to seven years  at which time the company s replacement market develops 
management is also able to observe the production trends of the oems and the new products that are being promoted 
allowance for bad debts the allowance is determined by reviewing known customer exposures and applying historical credit loss experience to the current receivable portfolio with consideration given to the current condition of the economy  assessment of the financial position of the creditors and overall trends in past due accounts compared to established thresholds 
the company monitors credit exposure and assesses the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts on a regular basis 
warranty reserves the warranty reserve is determined by recording a specific reserve for known warranty issues and a general reserve based on historical claims experience 
actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserve 
use of estimates the company incorporates many years of historical data into the determination of each of these estimates 
the company has a proven history of using accurate estimates and sound assumptions to calculate and record appropriate reserves 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
other accounting policies other loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties 
other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
policies related to revenue recognition and impairment of long lived assets require difficult judgments on matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative accounting guidance 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  which discusses accounting policies that must be selected by management when there are acceptable alternatives 
forward looking information this report contains forward looking statements and information that is based on management s beliefs  as well as assumptions made by  and information currently available to management 
when used in this document  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  intends  will  and expect and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following business conditions  rapid or unexpected technological changes  product development  inventory risks due to shifts in product demand  competition  domestic and foreign government relations  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  rising costs for components or unavailability of components  the timing of orders booked  lender relationships  and the risk factors listed from time to time in the company s reports filed with the commission

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and variability in interest rate spread relationships  such as prime to libor spreads 
approximately  of outstanding debt at february  related to long term indebtedness under variable rate debt 
interest on the outstanding balance of this debt will be charged based on a variable rate related to the prime rate or the libor rate 
both rate bases are incremented for margins specified in their agreements 
thus  the company s interest rate is subject to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates 
the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase across all maturities of variable rate debt would result in an decrease of approximately  in pre tax net income assuming no further changes in the amount of borrowings subject to variable rate interest from amounts outstanding at february  the company does not trade in derivative financial instruments 
the company reports its mexican subsidiary on the basis of the functional currency being the us dollar as over of the subsidiary s sales and purchases are with the parent with accounts receivable and accounts payable settled in us dollars 
additionally  the subsidiary leases its facilities and incurs rent based upon us dollars 
any exchange gains or losses due to the actual exchange of pesos and us dollars are minimal 
the company also has a subsidiary in the uk  which is not material  but uses the british pound as its functional currency 
due to its limited operations outside of the us  the company s exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies or to weakening economic conditions in foreign markets is not expected to significantly effect the company s financial position
