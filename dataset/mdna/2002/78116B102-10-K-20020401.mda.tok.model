item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
see risk factors under item  of part i of this report regarding certain factors known to us that could cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future results 
overview we opened our first restaurant under the name rubio s  home of the fish taco in we position our restaurants in the high quality  quick service mexican food segment of the restaurant industry 
our business strategy is to become the leading brand in this industry segment nationwide 
rubio s restaurants  inc was incorporated in california in and reincorporated in delaware in in may  we completed our initial public offering 
in  as part of our expansion strategy  we initiated a franchising program 
we have two signed franchise agreements as of march  representing commitments to open units  two of which were open as of march we opened stores and closed underperforming stores in our current expansion plan calls for us to open approximately eight company owned restaurants and our franchisees to open two restaurants in fiscal as a result of our expansion  period to period comparisons of our financial results may not be meaningful 
when a new unit opens  it will typically incur higher than normal levels of food and labor costs until new personnel gain experience 
hourly labor schedules are gradually adjusted downward during the first three months of a restaurant opening  in order to reach operating efficiencies similar to those at established units 
in calculating our comparable restaurant base  we introduce a restaurant into our comparable restaurant base once it has been in operation for calendar months 
revenues represent gross restaurant sales less coupons and other discounts and includes franchise and licensing revenue 
cost of sales is composed of food  beverage  and paper supply expense 
components of restaurant labor  occupancy and other expenses include direct hourly and management wages  bonuses  fringe benefit costs  rent and other occupancy costs  advertising and promotion  operating supplies  utilities  maintenance and repairs  and other operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses include all corporate and administrative functions that support existing operations and provide infrastructure to facilitate our future growth 
components of this category include management  supervisory and staff salaries and employee benefits  travel  information systems  training  corporate rent and professional and consulting fees and includes franchise expense for and 
table of contents used in training  the cost of the initial stocking of operating supplies and other direct costs related to opening 
critical accounting policies in december and january  the sec issued statements regarding disclosure by companies within their management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for in those statements  the sec encouraged companies to identify critical accounting policies in their annual reports on form k 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a review of the more critical accounting policies and methods used by us asset impairment and store closure expense the company periodically assesses its ability to recover the carrying value of its long lived assets 
if the company concludes that the carrying value will not be recovered based on expected future cash flows  an impairment write down is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value 
impairment is reviewed at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
in the company s circumstances  such analysis is performed on an individual restaurant basis 
the impairment charge is the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the assets for assets to be held and used and fair value less cost to sell for assets to be disposed of 
the company makes decisions to close stores based on their cash flows and anticipated future profitability 
the company records losses associated with the closure of restaurants in the same quarter that the decision to close these restaurants is made 
these store closure charges primarily represent a liability for the future lease obligations after the expected closure dates  net of estimated sublease income  if any 
asset impairment and store closure expense are estimates that we have recorded based on reasonable assumptions related to these restaurant locations at this point in time 
the conditions regarding these locations may change in the future and could be materially affected by factors such as our ability to maintain or improve sales levels  our ability to secure subleases  our success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors  the general health of the economy and resultant demand for commercial property 
amounts recorded may not be sufficient and adjustments may be necessary

revenue increased million or  to million for the weeks ended december  from million for the weeks ended december  the increase in was due in part to million in sales generated by a full year of operations from units opened in and that were not in our comparable unit base yet  combined with the million from the units opened in revenues were negatively impacted by the closure of under performing restaurants on october  ten of these restaurants had opened prior to and one restaurant had opened in january also negatively impacting the year over year revenue comparison was the rd week of sales in  which generated an additional million in revenue in total sales from all units that comprise our comparable base decreased million weeks vs 
week basis  or 
units enter the comparable store base after full months of operation 
the decrease in comparable store sales was primarily due to a decrease in transactions due to the limited success of promotional efforts in fiscal  offset by a increase in the average check amount 
cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased to in the weeks ended december  from in the weeks ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a price increase taken at the beginning of  a focus on proper portioning in the production of menu items  and favorable commodity costs in compared to restaurant labor  occupancy and other 
restaurant labor  occupancy  and other increased as a percentage of revenue to for the weeks ended december  from in the weeks ended december  the increase as a percentage of revenue is due in part to an increase in labor and related costs of 
these labor and related cost increases were primarily due to higher workers compensation costs in california  an increase in the minimum wage in california from to at the beginning of and overall wage inflation 
one of the factors that offset the labor cost increases was the closure of under performing restaurants in october the company believes that a greater reduction to overall labor cost will occur in as a result of the closure of these stores and one additional closed store in january of the increase in restaurant labor  occupancy and other costs  was due to higher rent and common area maintenance charges  which resulted from a greater mix of stores opened in higher rent shopping malls 
also impacting rent and common area maintenance costs were lower average unit revenue volumes  which creates higher occupancy costs as a percentage of revenue since these costs are fixed 
of the increase in restaurant labor  occupancy and other costs  was due to higher advertising costs as the company conducted additional research in to identify key issues to improve revenue 
another significant area contributing to the increase in this category was a increase in utility costs due to the higher electricity and natural gas prices during parts of in california 
on january   the california minimum wage increased from to 
this increase may have a material impact on our results in fiscal general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for both the weeks ended december  and the weeks ended december  increased legal costs and bonuses for our field operations group were offset by lower recruiting fees and training wages in the increased legal fees primarily related to class 
table of contents action complaints filed against the company by former employees 
these suits involve the issue of whether certain employees and former employees in the assistant and general manager positions who worked in the california restaurants were misclassified as exempt and deprived of overtime pay 
the lower recruiting and training costs resulted from less employee turnover in the restaurants 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue to in from in  primarily due to our expanding revenue base 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million in the weeks ended december  from million in the weeks ended december  the million increase was primarily due to the additional depreciation on the new units opened during and the new units opened during  offset by decreased depreciation as a result of store closures and asset impairments taken in september and asset impairments taken in december as well 
as a percentage of sales  depreciation and amortization remained constant at in both and pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses decreased to  for the weeks ended december  from  for the weeks ended december  primarily due to the decrease in unit openings to in compared to in the average pre opening cost per new unit opening year over year remained approximately the same at  per unit 
asset impairment and store closure expense 
in  we recorded a million charge related to the impairment of a select number of under performing restaurants as required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
additionally  we incurred million in store closure expense related to the closure or pending closure of under performing restaurants 
these special charges  which consisted primarily of lease reserves and de identification costs  were as follows a million reserve for closed stores in  million reserve for stores to be closed and million in reserves for severance and other closed store related charges 
eleven stores were closed in october  one was closed in february  and the remaining two will close over the next months  depending on lease restriction issues 
as of march   two of the underlying leases related to the closed stores had been terminated with lease buyouts and one other lease is under contract to be subleased without recourse to the company 
in  we recorded a million charge related to the impairment of a select number of under performing restaurants 
loss on disposal sale of property 
loss on asset disposals was  in compared to  in the higher loss in primarily relates to the write off of obsolete neon signs and d cor packages that had been purchased in advance and included in property 
interest income  net 
net interest income decreased to  for the weeks ended december  from  in net interest income for the weeks ended december  interest income decreased to  for the weeks ended december  from  for the weeks ended december  the decrease is primarily due to lower average cash balances as we used cash to open restaurants in and restaurants in in addition  the average interest rate earned on our cash decreased due to the declining interest rate environment

revenue increased million or  to million for the weeks ended december  from million for the weeks ended december  the increase in included restaurant sales of approximately million for the additional week 
the increase was also due in part to million in sales generated by a full year of operations from units opened in and that were not in our comparable unit base yet  combined with the million from the units opened in in addition  total revenue from all units that comprise our comparable base increased million weeks vs 
week basis 
comparable unit sales on a week vs 
week basis were up  or 
units enter the comparable store base after full months of operation 
the positive increase in comparable store sales was due to a increase in the average check amount  offset by a decrease in transactions due to the limited success of promotional efforts in fiscal cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenue increased to in the weeks ended december  from in the weeks ended december  primarily due to inefficiencies in our new markets and higher costs incurred relating to certain menu changes made in july restaurant labor  occupancy and other 
restaurant labor  occupancy  and other increased as a percentage of revenue to for the weeks ended december  from in the weeks ended december  the increase as a percentage of revenue is due in part to an increase in total direct labor of 
these labor increases were due to expected inefficiencies in the new stores  increasing mix of stores located in newer markets that have on average lower initial annual sales volumes than our mature markets and overall wage inflation 
in addition  we experienced one time training costs related to our new menu board and burrito enhancement rollout of approximately  the menu board rollout was completed in the third quarter of fiscal another factor causing this increase was the higher electricity costs in the san diego area 
utility costs increased from the prior year 
the other areas contributing to the increase were occupancy  due to opening restaurants in higher profile areas  advertising  labor related and in repairs 
a substantial number of our employees are subject to various minimum wage requirements 
many of our employees work in restaurants located in california and receive salaries equal to or slightly greater than the california minimum wage 
on january   the california minimum wage was increased to per hour from 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the weeks ended december  from million for the weeks ended december  the increase was primarily due to increases in salary and benefits related to the hiring of additional corporate employees and field management and other corporate level expenses required to support and manage unit and franchise expansion

there was no impairment expense recorded in interest income  net 
net interest income increased to  for the weeks ended december  from  in net interest income for the weeks ended december  interest income increased to  for the weeks ended december  from  for the weeks ended december  the increase is primarily due to realizing a full twelve months of additional cash available for investing in fiscal after our initial public offering  which was completed in may in addition  interest expense declined to  in from  in this decrease is primarily due to the repayment of all long term debt in with the proceeds from our initial public offering 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the weeks ended december  and weeks ended december  is based on the approximate annual effective tax rate applied to the respective period s pretax book loss income 
the tax benefit applied to comprises the federal and state statutory rates based on the annual effective rate on a pre tax loss of  for the tax rate applied to comprises the federal and state statutory rates based on the annual effective rate on pre tax income of  for seasonality historically  we have experienced seasonal variability in our quarterly operating results with higher sales per restaurant in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters 
the higher sales in the second and third quarters affect profitability by reducing the impact of our restaurants fixed and semi fixed costs  as well as through increased revenues 
this seasonal impact on our operating results is expected to continue 

table of contents inflation components of our operations subject to inflation include food  beverage  lease  utility  labor  and insurance costs 
our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation with respect to workers compensation insurance and utility expense has had a material impact on our results of operations in and liquidity and capital resources we have funded our capital requirements in recent years through public sale of equity securities  private placement of preferred stock  bank debt  and cash flow from operations 
we generated million in cash flow from operating activities for the weeks ended december  and million for the weeks ended december  net cash used in investing activities was million for the weeks ended december  compared to million for the weeks ended december  the million net decrease in cash used was primarily due to a net million decrease in capital expenditures offset by an approximate decrease in net investment activity 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the weeks ended december  compared to net cash generated from financing activities of  for the weeks ended december  financing activities in primarily consisted of proceeds from line of credit borrowings of million 
financing activities in primarily consisted of proceeds from exercises of common stock options  which generated  we have a million revolving line of credit agreement with a financial institution that matures july as of december  there was million borrowed against the line and another  utilized for a standby letter of credit related to our workers compensation policy 
interest on the revolving line of credit is calculated on the lower of either a bank reference rate plus  or on an adjusted london interbank offered rate plus  per annum at december  
effective december   we amended our credit line agreement because we did not meet one of the financial covenants specified under its terms 
the amended agreement  among other things  requires us to pay an increased unused commitment fee 
the amendment provided for the company to be in compliance with all covenants of the credit agreement as of december  our funds were principally used for the development and opening of new units 
we incurred million in capital expenditures during the weeks ended december   of which  million was for newly opened units  million for future openings  million for menu board upgrades  remodels and point of sale system upgrades  million for existing locations and million for corporate and information technology expenditures 
we incurred million in capital expenditures during the weeks ended december   of which  million was for newly opened units  million for future openings  million for menu board upgrades  remodels and point of sale system upgrades  million for existing locations and million for corporate and information technology expenditures 

table of contents we currently expect total capital expenditures in to be approximately million  of which approximately million is forecasted for the opening of new restaurants 
we currently plan to open approximately eight units in we currently expect that future locations will generally cost between  and  per unit  net of landlord allowances and excluding pre opening expenses 
some units may exceed this range due to the area in which they are built and the specific requirements of the project 
pre opening expenses are expected to average between  and  per restaurant 
the company is undertaking a number of projects in designed to potentially improve sales 
certain of these projects  including proposed new store design  a potential store remodel program  signage changes  and menu related changes could require a significant amount of capital 
the company is unable to estimate the capital requirements for these projects until certain project tests are complete and rollout schedules are determined 
we lease restaurant and office facilities and real property under operating leases expiring through we have leased all of our facilities  except for one building  to minimize the cash investment associated with each unit 
most of our leases are for year terms and include options to extend the terms 
the majority of our leases also include fixed rate and percentage of sales rent provisions 
our future minimum lease payments for our headquarters and restaurants are expected to be as follows million in  million  million in  million in  million in and million thereafter 
we believe that the anticipated cash flow from operations combined with funds currently anticipated to be available from our million credit facility and our cash and investments balance of million as of december  will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
for additional information regarding our credit facility  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements on page f of this report 
changes in our operating plans  changes in our expansion plans  lower than anticipated sales  our ability to meet the financial covenants of our credit facility  increased expenses  potential acquisitions or other events may cause us to seek additional or alternative financing sooner than anticipated 
additional or alternative financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain additional or alternative financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures are related to our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments primarily with maturities of less than one year 
the portfolio consists primarily of tax free municipals  corporate bonds  municipal bonds and mortgage and asset backed securities 
as of december   we have  in investments that have maturities in excess of one year 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
due to the types of investment and debt instruments we have  a change in period end interest rates or a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates would not have a material negative affect on our financial results 
as of december   we had available million of a total million revolving line of credit with a maturity date of july as of december   we have million borrowed against this facility and million assigned to a standby letter of credit related to our workers compensation insurance policy that matures in october interest on the revolving line of credit is calculated on the lower of either a bank reference rate plus  or on an adjusted london interbank offered rate plus  per annum at 
table of contents december  
we also pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the line of credit 
should we make additional draws on this line in the future  changes in interest rates would affect the interest expense on these loans and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
many of the food products purchased by us are affected by changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality and other factors outside our control 
in an effort to control some of this risk  we have entered into some fixed price purchase commitments with terms of less than a year 
in addition  we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food commodity risks
