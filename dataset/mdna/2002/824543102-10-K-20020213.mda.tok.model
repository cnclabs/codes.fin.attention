during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company changed its method of inventory costing from last in first out lifo to first in first out fifo for certain inventories 
prior periods have been restated to reflect this change

furthermore  the majority of the company s inventory is currently recorded using the fifo method  therefore  the change will provide for greater consistency in the accounting policies of the company and will also provide a better matching of revenue and expenses 
the change increased net loss in fiscal by million or 
per share and million or 
per share in and decreased net income by million or 
per share in  and increased retained earnings for years prior to by million 
in analyzing the financial aspects of the company s operations  you should consider the following factors 
plant utilization levels are very important to profitability because of the capital intensive nature of these operations 
because the company performs a number of different operations  it is not meaningful to analyze simply the total tons of steel processed 
for example  blanking and stamping involve more operational processes  from the design and manufacture of tools and dies to the production and packaging of the final product  than the company s other services and therefore generally have higher margins 
a portion of the company s steel processing and blanking products and services is provided to customers on a toll processing basis 
under these arrangements  the company charges a tolling fee for the operations that it performs without acquiring ownership of the steel and being burdened with the attendant costs of ownership and risk of loss 
although the proportion of tons of steel which the company uses or processes that is directly owned as compared to toll processed may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on customers needs  the company estimates that of total tons used or processed in its operations  approximately in  in and in were used or processed on a toll processing basis  excluding tons from which the company receives a storage fee  approximately in  in and in were used or processed on a toll processing basis 
revenues from toll processing as a percent of total revenues were approximately in  in  and in revenues from operations involving directly owned steel include a component of raw material cost whereas toll processing revenues do not 
consequently  toll processing generally results in lower revenue  but higher gross margin  than directly owned steel processing 
therefore  an increase in the proportion of total revenues attributable to directly owned steel processing may result in higher revenues but lower gross margins 
the company s stamping operations generally use more directly owned steel than its other operations 
changes in the price of scrap steel can have a significant effect on the company s results of operations because substantially all of its operations generate engineered scrap steel 
engineered scrap steel is a planned by product of the company s processing operations 
changes in the price of steel  however  also can impact the company s results of operations because raw material costs are by far the largest component of cost of sales in processing directly owned steel 
the company actively manages its exposure to changes in the price of steel  and  in most instances  passes along the rising price of steel to its customers 
at times  however  the company has been unable to do so 
over the last several years  the company s results of operations have been adversely affected by a large number of facility expansions and start up operations in recent periods  such as saltillo welded blank division and ohio welded blank division  an expansion facility of medina blanking  inc operations at expanded and new facilities are typically less efficient than established operations due to the implementation of new production processes 
in addition  the company depends on customers to implement their purchase programs in a timely manner  which affects the company s ability to achieve satisfactory plant utilization rates 
when the customers fail to implement their programs in a timely manner  the company s results are negatively impacted 
in the company s experience  operations at expanded or new facilities may be adversely impacted by the above factors for several periods 
in addition  during the last two fiscal years  the company s results of operations have been adversely impacted as a result of the shutdown and sale of certain operations 
during a shutdown  the company typically continues to incur certain fixed costs  such as overhead related expenses  while also experiencing a diversion of certain resources  such as management related resources 
the company continues to maintain a customer vendor relationship with ltv steel company ltv with respect to purchasing processed steel from ltv s remaining inventory 
in december  ltv filed for bankruptcy protection under title of the united states code 
in december  ltv was granted permission to liquidate assets under title of the united states code 
the company s exposure to pre petition and post petition matters with ltv has been mitigated where appropriate and existing reserves are maintained to further reduce this exposure 
the company does not believe its exposure related to ltv  or other customers  will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
in august  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets was issued effective for all fiscal years beginning after december  with early application encouraged 
this statement  which supersedes certain aspects of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  addresses implementation issues associated with sfas no 
and improves financial reporting by establishing one accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in july  sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets was issued effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after december  with earlier application permitted 
this statement establishes criteria for the recognition of intangible assets and their useful lives 
it also results in companies ceasing the amortization of goodwill and requires companies to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
as of november  the company is currently evaluating the impact that sfas no 
will have on its financial condition and results of operations 
the company expects that it will no longer record million of amortization associated with its million of existing goodwill 
the company does not have any intangible assets impacted by sfas no 
effective november   the company adopted sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
the adoption of sfas no

the increases at ohio welded blank division are primarily a result of increases in production at this facility as a result of increased demand related to sport utility platforms on which the company supplies certain parts 
the increases at these locations were partially off set by the overall slow down in the automotive and light truck and heavy truck markets

in addition  a restructuring charge of million was recognized for fiscal compared to a million restructuring charge in fiscal the fiscal restructuring charge resulted from the closings of romulus blanking division  wellington die division  c h and canton die division and severance expenses related to a salaried workforce reduction 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million for the comparable period in fiscal due primarily to increased average borrowings outstanding for the purchase of dickson manufacturing division  capital expansion at saltillo welded blank division and other capital expenditures made during fiscal and fiscal interest expense of approximately million relating to expansion of ohio welded blank division  the addition of saltillo welded blank division facility and new equipment at dickson manufacturing division was capitalized in fiscal other expense of million for fiscal decreased from other income of million in fiscal due primarily to loss on sale of assets at wellington die division and c h in fiscal  which was partially offset by the gain on the company jet of million in fiscal the income tax benefit was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  representing effective tax rates of and  respectively
