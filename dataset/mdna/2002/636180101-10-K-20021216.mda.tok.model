item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
back to table of contents results of operations critical accounting policies the company has prepared its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the following is a summary of the company s most critical accounting policies  which are defined as those policies whereby judgments or uncertainties could affect the application of those policies and materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
for a complete discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to item at note a summary of significant accounting policies 
oil and gas exploration and development costs 
in the company s exploration and production segment  oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development costs are capitalized under the full cost method of accounting 
under this accounting methodology  all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration  and development activities are capitalized  including internal costs directly identified with acquisition  exploration  and development activities 
the internal costs that are capitalized do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead  or similar activities 
the company believes that determining the amount of the company s proved reserves is a critical accounting estimate 
proved reserves are estimated quantities of reserves that  based on geologic and engineering data  appear with reasonable certainty to be producible under existing economic and operating conditions 
such estimates of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and may be subject to substantial revisions as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
the estimates involved in determining proved reserves are critical accounting estimates because they serve as the basis over which capitalized costs are depleted under the full cost method of accounting on a unit of production basis 
unevaluated properties are excluded from depletion until it is determined whether or not there are proved reserves that can be assigned to these properties 
once it is determined whether there are proved reserves or not  these costs are transferred to the costs being depleted 
in addition to depletion under the units of production method  proved reserves are a major component in the securities and exchange commission sec full cost ceiling test 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test is performed on a country by country basis and determines a limit  or ceiling  to the amount of property acquisition  exploration and development costs that can be capitalized 
the ceiling under this test represents a the present value of estimated future net revenues using a discount factor of  which is computed by applying current market prices of oil and gas to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves as of the date of the latest balance sheet less estimated future expenditures  plus b the cost of unevaluated properties not being depleted  less c income taxes 
the estimates of future production and future expenditures are based on internal budgets that reflect planned production from current wells and expenditures necessary to sustain such future production 
the ceiling is then compared to the capitalized cost of oil and gas properties less accumulated depletion and related deferred income taxes 
if the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties less accumulated depletion and related deferred taxes exceeds the ceiling  a non cash impairment must be recorded to write down the book value of the reserves to their present value 
this non cash impairment cannot be reversed at a later date if the ceiling increases 
it should also be noted that a non cash impairment to write down the book value of the reserves to their present value in any given period causes a reduction in future depletion expense 
the company recorded a non cash impairment relating to its canadian properties in this impairment amounted to million after tax and resulted from low oil and gas prices at september  regulation 
the company is subject to regulation by certain state and federal authorities 
the company  in its utility and pipeline and storage segments  has accounting policies which conform to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effect of certain types of regulation and which are in accordance with the accounting requirements and ratemaking practices of the regulatory authorities 
the application of these accounting policies allows the company to defer expenses and income on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those expenses and income will be allowed in the ratesetting process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in the income statement by an unregulated company 
these deferred regulatory assets and liabilities are then flowed through the income statement in the period in which the same amounts are reflected in rates 
management s assessment of the probability of recovery or pass through of regulatory assets and liabilities requires judgment and interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders 
if  for any reason  the company ceases to meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment for all or part of its operations  the regulatory assets and liabilities related to those portions ceasing to meet such criteria would be eliminated from the balance sheet and included in the income statement for the period in which the discontinuance of regulatory accounting treatment occurs 
such amounts would be classified as an extraordinary item 
accounting for derivative financial instruments 
the company  primarily in its exploration and production and energy marketing segments  uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas and crude oil 
these instruments can be categorized as price swap agreements  no cost collars  options and futures contracts 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the company accounts for these instruments as effective cash flow hedges or fair value hedges 
as such  gains or losses associated with the derivative financial instruments are matched with gains or losses resulting from the underlying physical transaction that is being hedged 
to the extent that the derivative financial instruments would ever be deemed to be ineffective  gains or losses from the derivative financial instruments would be marked to market on the income statement without regard to an underlying physical transaction 
the company uses both exchange traded and non exchange traded derivative financial instruments 
the fair value of the non exchange traded derivative financial instruments are based on valuations determined by the counterparties 
pension and other post retirement benefits 
the amounts reported in the company s financial statements related to its pension and other post retirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis  which uses many assumptions in the calculation of such amounts 
these assumptions include the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets  the rate of compensation increase and  for other post retirement benefits  the expected annual rate of increase in per capita cost of covered medical and prescription benefits 
changes in actuarial assumptions and actuarial experience could have a material impact on the amount of pension and post retirement benefit costs and funding requirements experienced by the company 
however  the company expects to recover substantially all of its net periodic pension and other post retirement benefit costs attributable to employees in its utility and pipeline and storage segments in accordance with the applicable regulatory commission authorization 
for financial reporting purposes  the difference between the amounts of pension cost and post retirement benefit cost recoverable in rates and the amounts of such costs as determined under applicable accounting principles is recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability  as appropriate  as discussed above under regulation 
earnings compared with the company s earnings were million  or per common share per common share on a diluted basis in this compares with earnings of million  or per common share per common share on a diluted basis in however  earnings in included a non cash impairment of the company s investment in the independence pipeline project in the pipeline and storage segment in the amount of million after tax  or per common share basic and diluted 
earnings in included a non cash impairment of oil and gas assets in the exploration and production segment in the amount of million after tax  or per common share per common share on a diluted basis  which is discussed above under critical accounting policies oil and gas exploration and development costs 
without these non cash impairments  earnings for would have been million  or per common share per common share on a diluted basis and earnings for would have been million  or per common share per common share on a diluted basis 
the decrease in earnings of million exclusive of the non cash impairments is primarily the result of lower earnings in the exploration and production segment 
additional discussion of earnings in each of the business segments can be found in the business segment information that follows

without this non cash impairment  earnings for would have been million  or per common share per common share on a diluted basis 
the increase in earnings of million exclusive of the non cash impairment was primarily the result of higher earnings in the exploration and production segment 
additional discussion of earnings in each of the business segments can be found in the business segment information that follows 
earnings loss by segment year ended september thousands utility  pipeline and storage  exploration and production  international  energy marketing  timber  total reportable segments  all other corporate  total consolidated  exclusive of the non cash asset impairment of the company s investment in the independence pipeline project  earnings for the pipeline and storage segment  and total consolidated would have been  and  respectively 
exclusive of the non cash asset impairment of oil and gas assets  earnings for the exploration and production segment and total consolidated would have been  and  respectively 
utility revenues utility operating revenues year ended september thousands retail revenues residential  commercial  industrial  off system sales  transportation  other  utility throughput million cubic feet mmcf year ended september retail sales residential  commercial  industrial  off system sales  transportation  compared with operating revenues for the utility segment decreased million in compared with this decrease largely resulted from a milion decrease in retail gas sales revenues 
off system sales revenues  transportation revenues  and other revenues also decreased by million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in retail gas sales revenues for the utility segment was largely a function of the recovery of lower gas costs gas costs are recovered dollar for dollar in revenues resulting from a much lower cost of purchased gas 
see further discussion of purchased gas below under the heading purchased gas 
the decrease also resulted from a decrease in retail sales volumes  as shown above 
warmer weather  as shown in the table below  and a general economic downturn in the utility segment s sales territory were major factors for the decrease in retail sales volumes 
warmer weather and the general economic downturn were also factors in the decrease in transportation revenues and volumes 
the decrease in off system sales revenues was largely due to lower gas prices  which more than offset higher volumes 
however  due to profit sharing with retail customers  the margins resulting from off system sales were minimal 
the decrease in other revenues primarily reflects estimated refund provisions recorded in and amounting to million and million  respectively  recorded in the utility s new york jurisdiction under an earnings sharing mechanism 
this earnings sharing mechanism  which is in accordance with the three year rate settlement reached with the nypsc that went into effect october  new york rate settlement  requires the utility to share with customers of earnings above a predetermined amount 
the final refund for the new york rate settlement will not be known until the end of partly offsetting the decreases to revenue discussed above was the positive impact of a lower bill credit in the utility s new york jurisdiction 
in connection with the new york rate settlement  the utility s new york customers received a million rate decrease in the form of a bill credit for the november  through march  heating season 
for the november  through march  heating season  the amount of the bill credit was reduced to million 
compared with operating revenues for the utility segment increased million in compared with this resulted from an increase in retail and off system gas sales revenues of million and million  respectively 
other operating revenues also increased by million 
these increases were partly offset by a decrease in transportation revenues of million 
the increase in retail gas sales revenues for the utility segment was largely a function of the recovery of higher gas costs  coupled with an increase in retail sales volumes  as shown above 
the recovery of higher gas costs resulted from a much higher cost of purchased gas 
see further discussion of purchased gas below under the heading purchased gas 
the increase in retail sales volumes was primarily the result of the migration of residential and small commercial customers from transportation service to retail service in both the new york and pennsylvania jurisdictions  coupled with the impact of colder weather 
this migration from transportation service resulted from one marketer entering bankruptcy proceedings  another marketer exiting the residential market  and the conclusion of a marketer pilot program in pennsylvania 
off system sales revenues increased because of higher gas prices 
the decrease in transportation revenues and volumes was primarily due to the migration from transportation service discussed above and the fact that certain commercial and industrial customers were reducing usage due to a slowing economy or they were fuel switching 
the increase in other operating revenues was due primarily to million of various revenue reductions in that did not recur in of which million was offset by lower operation and maintenance expense in 
these revenue reductions related to the september  conclusion of the two year rate settlement approved by the nypsc 
in addition to these adjustments  a million lower provision for refund was recorded in as compared with the provision for refund in related to the conclusion of the two year rate settlement and the provision for refund in related to the three year rate settlement approved by the nypsc in october referred to above as new york rate settlement 
revenues in as compared to revenues in were reduced by a million rate decrease for the utility s new york customers that went into effect october  in connection with the aforementioned new york rate settlement 
this rate decrease was provided in the form of a bill credit included in rates during the november  through march  heating season 
earnings compared with the utility segment s earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with the earnings of million in however  the earnings for included million of non recurring earnings associated with stock appreciation rights refer to item at note d capitalization for a discussion of the november cancellation of stock appreciation rights and million of non recurring after tax expense associated with early retirement offers in the utility s new york and pennsylvania jurisdictions 
exclusive of these two items  the decrease in earnings was million 
warmer weather in the pennsylvania jurisdiction and lower normalized usage per account normalized usage excludes the impact of weather on consumption across the utility s service territory due to a downturn in the economy significantly decreased earnings in also contributing to the decrease were several routine regulatory true up adjustments associated with income taxes  lost and unaccounted for gas and interest expense 
the impact of the refund provision discussed above was largely offset by lower operation and maintenance expenses  primarily labor 
the impact of the lower bill credit million pre tax and million after tax  discussed above  partly offset these decreases 
the impact of weather on the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction is tempered by a weather normalization clause wnc 
the wnc in new york  which covers the eight month period from october through may  has had a stabilizing effect on earnings for the new york rate jurisdiction 
in addition  in periods of colder than normal weather  the wnc benefits the utility segment s new york customers 
in  the wnc in new york preserved earnings of approximately million after tax as weather  overall in the new york service territory  was warmer than normal for the period from october through may since the pennsylvania jurisdiction does not have a wnc  uncontrollable weather variations directly impact earnings 
in the pennsylvania service territory  weather during was warmer than and warmer than normal 
compared with in the utility segment  earnings were million  up million from the prior year 
however  the earnings for included million of non recurring after tax expense associated with early retirement offers in the utility s new york and pennsylvania jurisdictions  and the earnings for included million of non recurring after tax revenue adjustments million pretax related to the conclusion of the two year rate settlement  as discussed in the revenue section above 
stock appreciation rights also had a significant impact on earnings as had earnings of million and had million of after tax expense 
this was due to a significant change in the market price of the company s common stock as the market price increased significantly in followed by a significant decrease in the market price in exclusive of these four items  there was actually a decrease in earnings of million 
a main reason for the decrease was the million rate decrease in the utility segment s new york jurisdiction  as previously discussed  which more than offset the positive earnings impact of colder weather in the utility segment s pennsylvania jurisdiction 
in  the wnc in new york preserved earnings of approximately million after tax as weather  overall in the new york service territory  was warmer than normal for the period from october through may in the pennsylvania service territory  which does not have a wnc  weather during was colder than and colder than normal 
degree days percent warmer colder than year ended september normal actual normal prior year buffalo   erie   buffalo   erie   buffalo   erie   purchased gas the cost of purchased gas is the company s single largest operating expense 
annual variations in purchased gas costs can be attributed directly to changes in gas sales volumes  the price of gas purchased and the operation of purchased gas adjustment clauses 
currently  distribution corporation has contracted for long term firm transportation capacity with supply corporation and six other upstream pipeline companies for long term gas supplies with a combination of producers and marketers and for storage service with supply corporation and three nonaffiliated companies 
in addition  distribution corporation can satisfy a portion of its gas requirements through spot market purchases 
changes in wellhead prices have a direct impact on the cost of purchased gas 
distribution corporation s average cost of purchased gas  including the cost of transportation and storage  was per thousand cubic feet mcf in  a decrease of from the average cost of per mcf in the average cost of purchased gas in was higher than the per mcf in additional discussion of the utility segment s gas purchases appears under the heading sources and availability of raw materials in item pipeline and storage revenues pipeline and storage operating revenues year ended september thousands firm transportation  interruptible transportation  firm storage service  interruptible storage service other  pipeline and storage throughput mmcf year ended september firm transportation  interruptible transportation  compared with operating revenues for the pipeline and storage segment decreased million in as compared with for  the decrease resulted primarily from a million decrease in transportation revenues  as shown in the table above  and a million decrease in cashout revenues included in other revenues in the table above 
cashout revenues represent a cash resolution of a gas imbalance whereby a customer pays supply corporation for gas the customer receives in excess of amounts delivered into supply corporation s system by the customer s shipper 
cashout revenues are offset by purchased gas expense 
the decrease in transportation revenues primarily reflects lower gathering rates the rates charged by supply corporation to its transportation customers to move gas from a third party well site or nearby meter to supply corporation s transmission pipelines for delivery as a result of a provision in a february settlement with ferc that ended in however  this rate decrease is largely offset by a reduction in amortization expense  thus having little impact on net income 
another impact of this settlement was that supply corporation no longer had the responsibility to process gas for local producers 
as such  there was a reduction in gas processing revenues 
however  this reduction was offset by higher revenues from unbundled pipeline sales and open access transportation 
both gas processing revenues and revenues from unbundled pipeline sales and open access transportation are included in other revenues in the table above 
while transportation volumes decreased during the year  volume fluctuations generally do not have a significant impact on revenues as a result of supply corporation s straight fixed variable rate design 
compared with operating revenues for the pipeline and storage segment increased million in compared with the increase is attributable primarily to a million increase in revenues from unbundled pipeline sales and open access transportation due to higher prices and volumes 
while transportation volumes increased bcf during the fiscal year  volume fluctuations generally do not have a significant impact on revenues as a result of supply corporation s straight fixed variable rate design 
earnings compared with the pipeline and storage segment s earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in however  as discussed above  the earnings for included a million non recurring after tax expense million pre tax associated with the impairment of the company s investment in the independence pipeline project 
earnings for included million of non recurring earnings associated with stock appreciation rights  million of non recurring earnings associated with a termination fee received from a customer to cancel a long term transportation contract  and million of non recurring after tax expense associated with early retirement offers 
exclusive of these four items  there was an increase in earnings of million 
this increase resulted primarily from lower operation and maintenance expenses  which were the result of the company s recent early retirement offers  and a lower effective income tax rate 
compared with the pipeline and storage segment s earnings for were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings for however  earnings for included million of non recurring earnings associated with a termination fee received from a customer to cancel a long term transportation contract  and million of non recurring after tax expense associated with early retirement offers 
stock appreciation rights also had a significant impact on earnings as had earnings of million and had million of after tax expense 
as previously discussed  significant swings in the market price of the company s common stock caused this earnings impact 
exclusive of these four items  there was a decrease in earnings of million 
while revenues from unbundled pipeline sales and open access transportation increased  the increase was more than offset by additional executive retirement benefit expenses in exploration and production revenues exploration and production operating revenues year ended september thousands gas after hedging  oil after hedging  gas processing plant  other  intrasegment elimination  represents the elimination of certain west coast gas production revenue included in gas after hedging in the table above that is sold to the gas processing plant shown in the table above 
an elimination for the same dollar amount is made to reduce the gas processing plant s purchased gas expense 
production volumes year ended september gas production mmcf gulf coast  west coast  appalachia  canada  oil production mbbl gulf coast  west coast  appalachia canada  average prices year ended september average gas price mcf gulf coast west coast appalachia canada weighted average weighted average after hedging average oil price barrel bbl gulf coast west coast appalachia canada weighted average weighted average after hedging refer to further discussion of hedging activities below under market risk sensitive instruments and in note f financial instruments in item of this report 
includes low gravity oil which generally sells for a lower price 
compared with operating revenues for the exploration and production segment decreased million in as compared with oil production revenue after hedging decreased million due primarily to a per bbl decrease in the weighted average price of oil after hedging 
gas production revenue after hedging  decreased million 
decreases in the weighted average price of gas after hedging per mcf more than offset an overall increase in gas production 
the overall increase in gas production is largely attributable to the canadian properties acquired in june ie  the player petroleum corp 
acquisition player offset partially by decreased production in the gulf coast region 
the decrease in gulf coast production is the result of the previously announced strategy to exit the gulf of mexico and shift emphasis to longer lived on shore reserves 
the company is shifting its emphasis because it believes that future quality off shore reserves will require deeper and riskier off shore drilling that will be more expensive than the reserves it has been able to find under its current drilling program in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico 
the company anticipates that shifting to longer lived on shore reserves will allow it to drill and develop lower cost  lower risk reserves 
gas processing plant revenues decreased million due to significantly lower gas prices 
other revenues decreased million largely due to the non recurring mark to market gains on derivative financial instruments that were recorded in  as discussed below 
refer to further discussion of derivative financial instruments in the market risk sensitive instruments section that follows 
refer to the tables above for production and price information 
compared with operating revenues for the exploration and production segment increased million in compared with gas production revenue after hedging increased million due primarily to an increase in the weighted average price of gas after hedging 
overall gas production decreased  primarily in the gulf coast region  as there were delays in placing new platforms on production due to rig availability constraints and delays in work over activity  mostly during the first and second quarters of new gulf coast production in the second half of was primarily oil production 
gas production from the player acquisition in june helped mitigate the gas production decline in the gulf coast region 
oil production revenue after hedging increased million in compared with this increase is due primarily to a increase in oil production  largely attributable to the exploration and production segment s canadian properties acquired as part of the june acquisition of tri link resources  ltd 
tri link 
revenue from this segment s gas processing plant was up million due to higher prices 
in addition  this segment recognized other revenue increases of million due to mark to market adjustments related to derivative financial instruments 
these mark to market adjustments largely related to written options that did not qualify for hedge accounting 
the written options covered the period from january to december earnings compared with the exploration and production segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with a loss of million in however  earnings included a non cash impairment of this segment s oil and gas assets totaling million after tax  as previously discussed 
excluding the impact of this impairment  there was a decrease in earnings of million 
as discussed above  decreases in the weighted average commodity prices of crude oil and natural gas after hedging per bbl and per mcf  respectively were primarily responsible for this earnings decrease 
higher workover expenses in the gulf coast region also contributed to the earnings decrease 
the major workover expenditures occurred on vermilion and eugene island block compared with the exploration and production segment experienced a loss of million in  a decrease of million when compared to earnings of million 
excluding the million after tax non cash impairment discussed above  this segment had earnings of million  an increase of million from earnings 
a increase in oil production  largely attributable to the tri link acquisition in june  combined with higher natural gas prices  were major factors in this segment s earnings increase  exclusive of the non cash asset impairment 
also  this segment s earnings benefited from the mark to market revenue increases discussed above 
partly offsetting higher revenues was an increase in production related expenses  including higher depletion  higher purchased gas expense for the gas processing plant  an increase in lease operating costs and higher production taxes 
general and administrative expenses increased  largely due to the player and tri link acquisitions 
greater interest expense due to higher borrowings related to the player and tri link acquisitions also partially offset the positive impact of higher revenues 
international revenues international operating revenues year ended september thousands heating  electricity  other  international heating and electric volumes year ended september heating sales gigajoules  electricity sales megawatt hours  gigajoules one billion joules 
a joule is a unit of energy 
compared with operating revenues for the international segment decreased million in as compared with the decrease in heat revenues in compared to reflects the june sale of jablonecka teplarenska a realitni  as a district heating plant located in the czech republic which had heating revenues of million in  and heating volumes of  gigajoules in 
it also reflects the impact of weather in the czech republic  which was warmer in than in the prior year 
however  an increase in the average value of the czech koruna czk compared to the us dollar offset much of the impact of these negative factors 
compared with operating revenues for the international segment decreased million in compared with the revenue decrease largely reflects a decrease in the average value of the czk compared to the us dollar during the heating season compared to the heating season 
exclusive of the exchange rate impact  heating revenues increased due to rate increases offset partly by lower volumes associated with warmer weather 
electric revenues  exclusive of the exchange rate impact  decreased as a result of lower volumes principally attributable to the scheduled shutdown of a generating turbine that had reached the end of its useful life and a decline in electric rates 
earnings compared with the international segment experienced a loss of million in compared with a loss of million in higher operation and maintenance expenses associated with the company s european power development projects refer to capital resources and liquidity under the heading estimated capital expenditures were the main factors for the higher loss in lower interest expense and a higher effective tax rate partially offset the impact of higher operation and maintenance expenses 
compared with the international segment experienced a loss of million in compared with earnings of million 
lower heat and electric margins  as a result of warmer weather and the scheduled shutdown of a generating turbine  were the primary reasons for this decrease 
the decrease also reflects a decrease in value of the czk compared to the us dollar  as previously discussed 
energy marketing revenues energy marketing operating revenues year ended september thousands natural gas after hedging  electricity other energy marketing volumes year ended september natural gas mmcf  compared with operating revenues for the energy marketing segment decreased million in  as compared with this decrease was primarily the result of lower natural gas commodity prices that were recovered through revenues 
lower volumes  which were principally the result of warmer weather  also contributed to the decrease in operating revenues 
refer to further discussion of derivative financial instruments in the market risk sensitive instruments section that follows 
compared with operating revenues for the energy marketing segment increased million in compared with the primary reason for this increase was the higher gas costs that are reflected in the natural gas marketing revenues 
higher marketing volumes are primarily due to colder weather in compared to this compensated for a decrease in nfr s customers from september  to september  in addition  the energy marketing segment recognized a negative million mark to market adjustment in included in other on the table above related to written options and futures contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting 
earnings compared with earnings in the energy marketing segment increased million in as compared with this increase primarily reflects higher margins on gas sales and lower interest and operation and maintenance expenses 
margins increased as a result of improved operational strategies put in place by the energy marketing segment s new management team 
compared with the energy marketing segment incurred a loss for of million  a decrease of million compared with the loss of million in however  the loss for included million of non recurring after tax expense associated with a mark to market loss on natural gas inventory 
exclusive of this item  the loss in was million  a decrease of million from the loss incurred in the most significant reason for the lower loss was the change in mark to market adjustments from to million positive contribution after tax  referred to above 
timber revenues timber operating revenues year ended september thousands log sales  green lumber sales  kiln dry lumber sales  other  timber board feet year ended september thousands log sales  green lumber sales  kiln dry lumber sales  compared with operating revenues for the timber segment increased million in  as compared with when comparing to  log sales decreased million as weather that was warmer and wetter than normal during the first and second quarters of hampered the ability to cut and haul logs  specifically cherry veneer 
the company made up for this lost revenue through higher sales of lumber 
green lumber sales increased million and kiln dry lumber sales increased million mostly due to an increase in kiln dry cherry volumes 
compared with operating revenues for the timber segment increased million in  as compared with green lumber sales were up due to an increase in board feet sold at slightly higher prices 
the increase in kiln dry lumber sales was due to the operation of two additional kilns brought on line in august the decrease in log sales revenues primarily reflects lower sales of quality logs offset partly by higher average prices 
earnings compared with earnings in the timber segment increased million in as compared with the increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues  as mentioned above  and lower interest expense 
the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in kiln dry cherry lumber sales volumes 
compared with timber segment earnings of million in were up million compared with the increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues  as mentioned above  and lower interest expense 
corporate and all other operations compared with corporate and all other operations experienced a loss of million in  an improvement of million over the loss of million in however  the loss for included million of non recurring earnings associated with stock appreciation rights and million of non recurring after tax expense associated with a mark to market loss on natural gas inventory by upstate  the company s wholly owned subsidiary which is engaged in wholesale natural gas marketing and other energy related activities 
exclusive of these items  earnings decreased million largely due to higher interest costs  partially offset by lower operation costs 
compared with corporate and all other operations experienced a loss of million in  a decrease of million over the gain of million in however  the loss for included million of non recurring after tax expense associated with a mark to market loss on natural gas inventory by upstate  as discussed above 
stock appreciation rights also had a significant impact on earnings as had earnings of million and had million of after tax expense 
as previously discussed  significant swings in the market price of the company s common stock caused this earnings impact 
exclusive of these three items  earnings decreased million largely due to higher interest costs and higher operation costs 
operations of unconsolidated subsidiaries the company s unconsolidated subsidiaries consist of equity method investments in seneca energy ii  llc seneca energy  model city energy  llc model city  and energy systems north east  llc esne 
the company has ownership interests in each of these entities 
seneca energy and model city generate and sell electricity using methane gas obtained from landfills owned by outside parties 
esne generates electricity from an megawatt  combined cycle  natural gas fired power plant in north east  pennsylvania 
esne sells its electricity into the new york power grid 
the company also had a equity method investment in independence pipeline company which was written off in  as previously discussed 
the independence write off of million million after tax is recorded on the consolidated statement of income as impairment of investment in partnership 
compared with income from unconsolidated subsidiaries which represents the company s equity method interest in the income or loss from its investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries decreased million in compared with this decrease is largely attributable to losses experienced by the esne investment during of million compared to income in the prior year of million 
esne was formed on april  so income for did not reflect any of the normal operating losses that esne incurs during the fall and winter months 
esne generates most of its electricity during the spring and summer months when electricity demand peaks for air conditioning requirements 
esne experienced higher electric generation revenues in the spring and summer of compared with the same period in the seneca energy investment also experienced an earnings decrease of million due to lower electric generation revenues and higher repair and maintenance expenditures on the generating engines 
some repairs were delayed from to to enable seneca energy to operate more hours while market prices for electricity were higher than normal 
compared with income from unconsolidated subsidiaries increased million in compared with the esne and model city investments added income of million and million  respectively  as was the first year of operation for both investments 
the seneca energy investment also saw an increase in income of million as was the first complete year of operation for this investment 
these increases were largely offset by a million reduction in equity method income from independence pipeline company 
other income and interest charges although most of the variances in other income items and interest charges are discussed in the earnings discussion by segment above  following is a summary on a consolidated basis other income other income decreased million in compared with this decrease resulted primarily from a million termination fee received in from a customer in the pipeline and storage segment to cancel a long term transportation contract 
the company has been able to market the excess capacity resulting from this termination 
other income increased million in compared with this increase resulted primarily from the same million buyout of a long term transportation contract in the pipeline and storage segment discussed above 
interest charges interest on long term debt increased million in and million in the increase in both years resulted mainly from a higher average amount of long term debt outstanding 
long term debt balances have grown significantly over the past few years primarily as a result of acquisition activity in the exploration and production segment 
these acquisitions were initially financed with short term debt which was subsequently repaid through the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt 
other interest charges decreased million in and million in the decrease in was the result of a decrease in the average amount of short term debt outstanding short term debt was refinanced with long term debt and lower weighted average interest rates 
the decrease in was primarily the result of lower weighted average interest rates on short term debt 
capital resources and liquidity the primary sources and uses of cash during the last three years are summarized in the following condensed statement of cash flows sources uses of cash year ended september millions provided by operating activities capital expenditures investment in subsidiaries  net of cash acquired investment in partnerships other investing activities short term debt  net change long term debt  net change issuance of common stock dividends paid on common stock dividends paid to minority interest effect of exchange rates on cash net increase decrease in cash and temporary cash investments operating cash flow internally generated cash from operating activities consists of net income available for common stock  adjusted for noncash expenses  noncash income and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
noncash items include depreciation  depletion and amortization  impairment of oil and gas producing properties in  deferred income taxes  impairment of investment in partnership  income or loss from unconsolidated subsidiaries net of cash distributions and minority interest in foreign subsidiaries 
cash provided by operating activities in the utility and pipeline and storage segments may vary substantially from year to year because of the impact of rate cases 
in the utility segment  supplier refunds  over or under recovered purchased gas costs and weather also significantly impact cash flow 
the impact of weather on cash flow is tempered in the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction by its wnc and in the pipeline and storage segment by supply corporation s straight fixed variable rate design 
cash provided by operating activities in the exploration and production segment may vary from period to period as a result of changes in the commodity prices of natural gas and crude oil 
the company uses various derivative financial instruments  including price swap agreements  no cost collars and options in an attempt to manage this energy commodity price risk 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  a decrease of million compared with the million provided by operating activities in lower cash receipts from the sale of oil and gas in the exploration and production segment more than offset higher margins on gas sales in the energy marketing segment 
oil and gas prices were down significantly in the exploration and production segment for much of and oil and gas production was slightly lower than investing cash flow expenditures for long lived assets expenditures for long lived assets include additions to property  plant and equipment capital expenditures and investments in corporations stock acquisitions or partnerships  net of any cash acquired 
the company s expenditures for long lived assets totaled million in the table below presents these expenditures total investments expenditures capital in corporations for long year ended september  millions expenditures or partnerships lived assets utility pipeline and storage exploration and production international energy marketing timber all other utility the majority of the utility capital expenditures were made for replacement of mains and main extensions  as well as for the replacement of service lines 
pipeline and storage the majority of the pipeline and storage segment s capital expenditures were made for additions  improvements and replacements to this segment s transmission and gas storage systems 
approximately million was spent on expansion of transportation capacity on line ym running from ellisburg  pennsylvania to leidy  pennsylvania 
during  sip made an additional  investment in independence pipeline company independence  bringing sip s total investment to million 
in june  independence submitted a motion to ferc requesting that ferc vacate the certificate issued to independence on july  to construct  own and operate the independence pipeline 
independence took this action because it had been unable to obtain sufficient customer contracts to proceed with the project 
in connection with the filing of the motion by independence  sip wrote off its million investment in independence  as previously discussed 
ferc formally vacated the certificate in an order issued in july exploration and production the exploration and production segment s capital expenditures included approximately million of capital expenditures for on shore drilling  construction and recompletion costs for wells located in louisiana  texas  california and canada as well as on shore geological and geophysical costs  including the purchase of certain three dimensional seismic data and fixed asset purchases 
of the million discussed above  million was spent on the exploration and production segment s canadian properties 
the exploration and production segment s capital expenditures also included approximately million for its off shore program in the gulf of mexico  including offshore drilling expenditures  offshore construction  lease acquisition costs and geological and geophysical expenditures 
during  the exploration and production segment sold oil and gas properties amounting to million 
most of these properties were in the gulf coast region 
these proceeds were recorded as a reduction of property  plant and equipment and are reflected in other investing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows 
international the majority of the international segment s capital expenditures were concentrated on the construction of boilers at a district heating and power generation plant in the czech republic 
the expenditures also included improvements and replacements within the district heating and power generation plants 
timber the majority of the timber segment capital expenditures were made for the purchase of land and timber rights in potter county  pennsylvania in june the land  consisting of approximately  acres  was purchased by seneca from wending creek  llc  an entity controlled by certain members of the john rigas family for  a form k filed by adelphia communications corporation adelphia on june  states that the rigas family had previously agreed to transfer the land to adelphia in exchange for a  reduction in the amount of the rigas family s primary co borrowing obligations  and seneca paid the purchase price of the land directly to adelphia 
highland purchased the timber rights associated with the land from acc operations  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of adelphia  for  the remaining capital expenditures were for smaller purchases of land and timber as well as equipment for this segment s sawmill and kiln operations 
estimated capital expenditures the company s estimated capital expenditures for the next three years are year ended september millions utility pipeline and storage exploration and production international timber all other estimated capital expenditures for the utility segment in will be concentrated in the areas of main and service line improvements and replacements and  to a minor extent  the installation of new services 
estimated capital expenditures for the pipeline and storage segment in will be concentrated in the reconditioning of storage wells and the replacement of storage and transmission lines 
the estimated capital expenditures also include million for an expansion of transportation capacity on line ym running from ellisburg  pennsylvania to leidy  pennsylvania 
the estimated capital expenditures do not include any partnership investments for northwinds pipeline 
the estimated capital expenditures also do not include the empire state pipeline empire  which the company agreed to purchase in october from duke energy corporation for million in cash plus assumed debt of million or any subsequent capital expenditures that would occur upon completion of the acquisition 
empire is a mile  inch pipeline that begins at the canadian border near buffalo  new york  which is within the company s service territory  and terminates in central new york just north of syracuse  new york 
empire is regulated by the nypsc 
empire has the capacity to transport million cubic feet of gas per day and currently has almost all of its capacity under contract  with a substantial portion being long term contracts 
empire delivers natural gas supplies to major industrial companies  utilities including the company s utility segment  and power producers 
empire would better position the company to bring canadian gas supplies into the east coast markets of the united states as demand for natural gas along the east coast increases 
the company notified the department of justice and federal trade commission of the proposed acquisition as required under the antitrust laws  and the company s request for early termination of the antitrust waiting period has been granted 
the company has also made a filing seeking approval of the transaction from the nypsc 
subject to nypsc approval  it is anticipated that the purchase will be completed in the beginning of calendar the company is evaluating various alternatives to finance this acquisition 
those alternatives could include the sale of certain non regulated assets  the issuance of equity  or the issuance of debt 
the company continues to explore various opportunities to participate in transporting gas to the northeast  either through supply corporation s system or in partnership with others 
this includes the proposed northwinds pipeline that the company and transcanada pipelines limited are pursuing 
this project presently contemplates a mile  inch natural gas pipeline that would originate in kirkwall  ontario  cross into the united states near buffalo  new york and follow a southerly route to its destination in the ellisburg leidy area in pennsylvania 
at september   the company had incurred approximatley million in costs all of which have been expensed associated with this project 
the initial capacity of the pipeline would be approximately million cubic feet of natural gas per day with the estimated cost of the pipeline ranging from to million 
if the pipeline is constructed  it is possible that a significant amount of the construction costs would be financed by banks or other financial institutions with the pipeline serving as collateral for the financing arrangement 
estimated capital expenditures in for the exploration and production segment include approximately million for canada  million for the gulf coast region million on the off shore program in the gulf of mexico  million for the west coast region and million for the appalachian region 
overall  estimated capital expenditures in for the exploration and production segment are lower than the prior year as the company intends to live within cash flow and pay down debt 
it should also be noted that estimated off shore expenditures are lower than the prior year as the company continues to shift its emphasis from short lived off shore reserves to longer lived on shore reserves 
the estimated capital expenditures for the international segment in will be concentrated on improvements and replacements within the district heating and power generation plants in the czech republic 
the estimated capital expenditures do not include any expenditures for the company s european power development projects 
currently  any costs incurred on these power development projects are expensed 
the company s european power development projects are primarily in italy and bulgaria 
in italy  the company has signed a joint development agreement with an italian utility for the construction of a megawatt combined cycle natural gas electric generating plant 
the estimated cost of this project is million to million 
in bulgaria  the company is pursuing the opportunity to construct  own and operate two new megawatt gas fired combustion turbines 
the estimated cost of this project is million to million 
whether the company moves forward to construct these projects will depend on successful negotiation of various operating agreements as well as the availability of funds from banks or other financial institutions to cover a significant amount of the construction costs 
the respective projects would serve as collateral for such financing arrangements 
estimated capital expenditures in the timber segment will be concentrated on the purchase of land and timber as well as the construction or purchase of new facilities and equipment for this segment s sawmill and kiln operations 
the estimated capital expenditures in the all other category in will be concentrated on the purchase and installation of a gas turbine and steam turbine by horizon power to create a megawatt cogeneration facility in buffalo  new york 
the company continuously evaluates capital expenditures and investments in corporations and partnerships 
the amounts are subject to modification for opportunities such as the acquisition of attractive oil and gas properties  timber or storage facilities and the expansion of transmission line capacities 
while the majority of capital expenditures in the utility segment are necessitated by the continued need for replacement and upgrading of mains and service lines  the magnitude of future capital expenditures or other investments in the company s other business segments depends  to a large degree  upon market conditions 
financing cash flow in august  million of the company s million medium term notes due august were repaid by the company at par plus accrued interest 
the company used short term debt to temporarily refund the million to the debt holders 
the remaining million of the original million issuance is scheduled to mature in august in september  the company issued million of senior unsecured notes due in september these notes become callable by the company at par in september after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions  the net proceeds to the company amounted to million 
the proceeds of this debt issuance were used to repay the short term debt used to temporarily refund the million discussed in the previous paragraph 
in november  the company issued million of medium term notes due in november after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions  the net proceeds to the company amounted to million 
the proceeds of this debt issuance were used to reduce short term debt 
consolidated short term debt decreased million during primarily due to the november medium term note issuance discussed above  and the use of cash from operations to pay down short term debt 
the company continues to consider short term debt an important source of cash for temporarily financing capital expenditures and investments in corporations or partnerships  gas in storage inventory  unrecovered purchased gas costs  exploration and development expenditures and other working capital needs 
fluctuations in these items can have a significant impact on the amount and timing of short term debt issuance and repayment 
the company has sec authorization under the public utility holding company act of  to borrow and have outstanding as much as million of short term debt at any time through december  the total amount available to be issued under the company s commercial paper program is million 
the commercial paper program is backed by a committed million  day and year credit facility  which was effective on september  under this committed credit facility  the company agrees that its debt to capitalization ratio will not  at the last day of any fiscal quarter  exceed 
from september  through september   
from october  through september  and 
from october  and at all times thereafter 
with regards to the company s short term notes payable to banks  the company uses uncommitted bank lines of credit aggregating million 
these uncommitted bank lines of credit are revocable at the option of the financial institutions and are reviewed on an annual basis 
the company anticipates that these lines of credit will continue to be renewed 
if a downgrade in the company s credit ratings were to occur  access to the commercial paper markets might not be possible 
however  the company could borrow under its uncommitted bank lines of credit or seek other liquidity sources  including cash provided by operations 
at september   the company had outstanding short term notes payable to banks and commercial paper of million and million  respectively 
the company s present liquidity position is believed to be adequate to satisfy known demands 
under the company s existing indenture covenants  at september   the company would have been permitted to issue up to a maximum of million in additional long term unsecured indebtedness at projected market interest rates in addition to being able to issue new indebtedness to replace maturing debt 
the company s indenture also contains certain cross default provisions wherein the failure by the company to pay the scheduled interest or principal on its outstanding short term or long term debt if such failure is not cured could trigger the obligation to re pay the debt outstanding under said indenture 
the company believes that it has adequate committed credit facilities in place to protect against such defaults 
the company s embedded cost of long term debt was at both september  and  respectively 
the company also has authorization from the sec  under the holding company act  to issue long term debt securities and equity securities in amounts not exceeding billion at any one time outstanding during the order s authorization period  which extends to december  the company currently has million of securities registered under the securities act of any additional public offerings above the million would require the filing of a registration statement with the sec 
the amounts and timing of the issuance and sale of debt or equity securities will depend on market conditions  indenture requirements  regulatory authorizations  and the capital requirements of the company 
the company has entered into certain off balance sheet financing arrangements 
these financing arrangements are primarily operating and capital leases 
the company s consolidated subsidiaries have operating leases  the majority of which are with the utility and the pipeline and storage segments  having a remaining lease commitment of approximately million 
these leases have been entered into for the use of vehicles  construction tools  meters  computer equipment and other items and are accounted for as operating leases 
the company s minority owned entities  which are accounted for under the equity method  have capital leases of electric generating equipment having a remaining lease commitment of approximately million 
the company has guaranteed or million of these capital lease commitments 
the following table summarizes the company s expected future contractual cash obligations as of september   and the twelve month periods over which they occur payments by expecte d maturity dates millions thereafter total long term debt short term bank notes commercial paper operating lease commitments capital lease commitments the company has made certain other guarantees on behalf of its subsidiaries 
the guarantees relate primarily to i obligations under derivative financial instruments  which are included on the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with sfas see item  md a under the heading critical accounting policies accounting for derivative financial instruments  ii utility segment obligations to purchase gas to be resold in its regulated business in accordance with established regulatory mechanisms to pass through the cost of that gas to its retail customers  iii nfr or upstate obligations to purchase gas or to purchase gas transportation storage services where the amounts due on those obligations each month are included on the consolidated balance sheet as a current liability  and iv other obligations which are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company believes that the likelihood it would be required to make payments under the guarantees is remote  and therefore has not included them on the table above 
the company is involved in litigation arising in the normal course of business 
also in the normal course of business  the company is involved in tax  regulatory and other governmental audits  inspections  investigations and other proceedings that involve state and federal taxes  safety  compliance with regulations  rate base  cost of service and purchased gas cost issues  among other things 
while the resolution of such litigation or regulatory matters could have a material effect on earnings and cash flows in the period of resolution  none of this litigation  and none of these regulatory matters  are expected to change materially the company s present liquidity position  nor have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company 
the company has a tax qualified  noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan retirement plan that covers substantially all domestic employees of the company 
the company has been making contributions to the retirement plan over the last several years equal to the maximum funding requirements of applicable laws and regulations 
in light of the dramatic decline in the stock market over the last several months  the company anticipates that it will continue making maximum funding contributions to the retirement plan 
during  the company contributed million to the retirement plan 
the company anticipates annual contributions to the retirement plan will be in the range of to million for the company expects that all subsidiaries having domestic employees covered by the retirement plan will make contributions to the retirement plan 
the funding of such contributions will come from amounts collected in rates in the utility and pipeline and storage segments  through short term borrowings or through cash from operations 
market risk sensitive instruments energy commodity price risk the company  primarily in its exploration and production and energy marketing segments  uses various derivative financial instruments derivatives  including price swap agreements  no cost collars  options and futures contracts  as part of the company s overall energy commodity price risk management strategy 
under this strategy  the company manages a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas and crude oil  thereby attempting to provide more stability to operating results 
the company has operating procedures in place that are administered by experienced management to monitor compliance with the company s risk management policies 
the derivatives are not held for trading purposes 
the fair value of these derivatives  as shown below  represents the amount that the company would receive from or pay to the respective counterparties at september  to terminate the derivatives 
however  the tables below and the fair value that is disclosed do not consider the physical side of the natural gas and crude oil transactions that are related to the financial instruments 
the following tables disclose natural gas and crude oil price swap information by expected maturity dates for agreements in which the company receives a fixed price in exchange for paying a variable price as quoted in inside ferc or on the new york mercantile exchange 
notional amounts quantities are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
the weighted average variable prices represent the weighted average settlement prices by expected maturity date as of september  at september   the company had not entered into any natural gas or crude oil price swap agreements extending beyond natural gas price swap agreements expec ted maturity dates total notional quantities equivalent bcf weighted average fixed rate per mcf weighted average variable rate per mcf crude oil price swap agreements expect ed maturity dates notional quantities equivalent bbls weighted average fixed rate per bbl weighted average variable rate per bbl at september   the company would have had to pay the respective counterparties an aggregate of approximately million to terminate the natural gas price swap agreements outstanding at that date 
the company would have had to pay an aggregate of approximately million to the counterparties to terminate the crude oil price swap agreements outstanding at september  at september   the company had natural gas price swap agreements covering bcf at a weighted average fixed rate of per mcf 
the company also had crude oil price swap agreements covering  bbls at a weighted average fixed rate of per bbl 
as indicated in the tables above  the company has significantly reduced its use of natural gas and crude oil price swap agreements  which is primarily attributable to low commodity prices during much of  which prevented the company from locking in favorable prices for its oil and gas production 
as commodity prices have improved in the first quarter of  the company may increase its use of natural gas and crude oil price swap agreements 
the following tables disclose the notional quantities  the weighted average ceiling price and the weighted average floor price for the no cost collars used by the company to manage natural gas and crude oil price risk 
the no cost collars provide for the company to receive monthly payments from or make payments to other parties when a variable price falls below an established floor price the company receives payment from the counterparty or exceeds an established ceiling price the company pays the counterparty 
at september   the company had not entered into any natural gas or crude oil no cost collars extending beyond no cost collars expected matur ity dates total natural gas notional quantities equivalent bcf weighted average ceiling price per mcf weighted average floor price per mcf crude oil notional quantities equivalent bbls   weighted average ceiling price per bbl weighted average floor price per bbl at september   the company would have received from the respective counterparties an aggregate of approximately million to terminate the natural gas no cost collars outstanding at that date 
the company would have paid an aggregate of approximately million to terminate the crude oil no cost collars outstanding at that date 
at september   the company had natural gas no cost collars covering bcf at a weighted average floor price of per mcf and a weighted average ceiling price of per mcf 
the company also had crude oil no cost collars covering  bbls at a weighted average floor price of per bbl and a weighted average ceiling price of per bbl 
as discussed above  low commodity prices during much of were the primary factors for the decrease in no cost collars from september to september with improvements in commodity prices during the first quarter of  the company may increase its use of natural gas and crude oil no cost collars 
the following table discloses the notional quantities and weighted average strike prices by expected maturity dates for options used by the company to manage natural gas price risk 
the put options provide for the exploration and production segment of the company to receive monthly payments from other parties when a variable price falls below an established floor or strike price 
the call options provide for the energy marketing segment of the company to receive monthly payments from other parties when a variable price rises above an established ceiling or strike price 
at september   the company held no options with maturity dates extending beyond options purchased expected maturity date natural gas put options notional quantities equivalent bcf weighted average strike price per mcf natural gas call options notional quantities equivalent bcf weighted average strike price per mcf at september   the company would have received from the respective counterparties an aggregate of approximately million to terminate the put options outstanding at that date 
the company would have received an aggregate of approximately million to terminate the call options outstanding at that date 
at september   the exploration and production segment of the company had natural gas put options covering bcf at a weighted average strike price of per mcf 
the company did not have any call options outstanding at that date 
because of the low commodity prices during much of  the company did not enter into any new put options during as for the call options  the energy marketing segment of the company began purchasing call options in as it began to offer variable price deals with a price cap to its residential customers 
the following table discloses the net notional quantities  weighted average contract prices and weighted average settlement prices by expected maturity date for futures contracts used to manage natural gas price risk 
at september   the company held no futures contracts with maturity dates extending beyond futures contracts expected maturity dates total net contract volumes purchased equivalent bcf weighted average contract price per mcf weighted average settlement price per mcf at september   the company would have received million to terminate these futures contracts 
at september   the company had futures contracts covering bcf net long position at a weighted average contract price of per mcf 
as indicated in the table above  the company has significantly reduced its use of natural gas futures contracts 
this reduction can be attributed primarily to a reduction in fixed price gas sales commitments in the energy marketing segment 
at september   natural gas prices were low and many of the customers in the energy marketing segment entered into fixed price contracts to lock in the commodity price of natural gas at that time 
at september   with natural gas prices being much higher than the prior year  many of the customers in the energy marketing segment chose to enter into variable price contracts that provided the opportunity to enter into a fixed price contract at a later date 
with variable price contracts  commodity price risk is moved from the company to the customer 
the company may be exposed to credit risk on some of the derivatives disclosed above 
credit risk relates to the risk of loss that the company would incur as a result of nonperformance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations 
to mitigate such credit risk  management performs a credit check and then  on an ongoing basis  monitors counterparty credit exposure 
management has obtained guarantees from the parent companies of the respective counterparties to its derivative financial instruments 
at september   the company used five counterparties for its over the counter derivative financial instruments 
to further reduce credit risk  the company increased the number of its counterparties to seven at september  at september   no individual counterparty represented greater than of total credit risk measured as volumes hedged by an individual counterparty as a percentage of the company s total volumes hedged 
exchange rate risk the international segment s investment in the czech republic is valued in czech korunas  and  as such  this investment is subject to currency exchange risk when the czech korunas are translated into us dollars 
the exploration and production segment s investment in canada is valued in canadian dollars  and  as such  this investment is subject to currency exchange risk when the canadian dollars are translated into us dollars 
at september  compared to september   the czech koruna was higher in value in relation to the us dollar  resulting in a million positive adjustment to the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment cta a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at september  compared to september   the canadian dollar was slightly higher in value in relation to the us dollar  resulting in a million positive adjustment to the cta 
further valuation changes to the czech koruna and canadian dollar would result in corresponding positive or negative adjustments to the cta 
management cannot predict whether the czech koruna or canadian dollar will increase or decrease in value against the us dollar 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from its borrowing under short term debt instruments 
at september   these instruments included domestic short term bank loans and commercial paper totaling million 
the interest rate on these short term bank loans and commercial paper approximated at september  the company s short term debt instruments also included million of short term bank loans in canada and the czech republic at september  the weighted average interest rates on the canadian and czech republic loans approximated and  respectively  at september  the following table presents the principal cash repayments and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date for the company s long term fixed rate debt as well as the other long term debt of certain of the company s subsidiaries

rate matters utility operation base rate adjustments in both the new york and pennsylvania jurisdictions do not reflect the recovery of purchased gas costs 
such costs are recovered through operation of the purchased gas adjustment clauses of the appropriate regulatory authorities 
new york jurisdiction on october   the nypsc approved a settlement agreement agreement between distribution corporation  staff of the department of public service  the new york state consumer protection board and multiple intervenors an advocate for large commercial and industrial customers that establishes rates for a three year period beginning october  the agreement provided that customers receive a bill credit of million for the november  through march  heating season  of which million related to customers share of earnings accumulated under previous settlements 
the credit was reduced to million for the november  through march  heating season 
the credit will remain at million for the november  through march  heating season and subsequent heating seasons unless the company can demonstrate that it is no longer justified 
also  earnings beyond a target level of return on equity will be shared equally between shareholders and customers 
the agreement provides further that the company and interested parties will resume discussions to address the nypsc s competition initiatives  including changes to customer choice transportation services  among other things 
those discussions commenced in november and ultimately produced an interim joint proposal  or settlement agreement  addressing several discrete issues of interest to the parties and the nypsc 
in an order issued on may   the nypsc adopted the parties joint proposal 
as recommended by the parties  the joint proposal modifies distribution corporation s operations relating to transportation services and transactions with marketers and producers of indigenous natural gas 
under the joint proposal  the parties also agreed to continue negotiations to implement additional features of the nypsc s restructuring initiative described below 
those confidential discussions  dubbed phase iii negotiations  concluded on january  when the parties executed a comprehensive joint proposal 
the comprehensive joint proposal proposes a number of changes to distribution corporation s rates and services through september   including the following o modification of transportation balancing services and upstream capacit y rules for the benefit of marketers and to preserve reliability  o a customer funded back out credit provided to marketers or marketer customers to reduce marketer costs and thereby promote competition  o provisions to promote increased marketer usage of indigenous natural g as  o an expanded low income program that provides arrearage forgiveness and a discounted rate for up to  customers  o increased customer funding to offset the cost of uncollectibles  o unbundling of gas costs from delivery rates  and o mechanisms for recovery of stranded pipeline and unbundling costs 
the comprehensive joint proposal was filed with the nypsc on january  and approved with immaterial modifications on april   effective may  distribution corporation s base rates will not be materially changed under the comprehensive joint proposal  which is not intended to modify the rate and revenue requirements established in the agreement described above 
on september   the nypsc issued an order under which distribution corporation was ordered to show cause why an action for penalties up to million should not be commenced against it for alleged violations of consumer protection requirements 
according to the nypsc  the alleged violations may have caused or contributed to the death of an individual in an unheated apartment 
on december   distribution corporation filed its response submitted under a seal of confidentiality imposed by the supreme court  erie county designed to protect the personal privacy interests of the deceased individual and requested that the nypsc either close dismiss the show cause proceeding based on the evidence presented in distribution s response  or hold administrative evidentiary hearings to demonstrate that a penalty action is unwarranted 
on july  the nypsc issued an order granting distribution corporation s request for hearings  and referred the matter to an administrative law judge for scheduling 
the company believes and will continue to vigorously assert that the nypsc s allegations lack merit 
pennsylvania jurisdiction distribution corporation currently does not have a rate case on file with the pennsylvania public utility commission papuc

management will continue to monitor supply corporation s financial position to determine the necessity of filing a rate case in the future 
the federal law under which ferc regulates supply corporation s rates  practices  and terms and conditions of service requires  among other things  that supply corporation not grant any undue preference or advantage to any person 
in march  ferc staff began a routine audit of supply corporation s practices and dealings with marketing affiliates  ie  other company subsidiaries which conduct natural gas transportation and or storage transactions with supply 
on july   ferc adopted an order instituting an investigation directed to supply corporation and its natural gas marketing affiliates  under sections and of the natural gas act and section of the natural gas policy act 
this is not an investigation into supply s currently effective rates  or any energy trading activities  wash sales  round trip transactions  sales of electricity into the california market  or other activities that have been the subjects of recent news stories regarding other publicly traded energy companies 
the company does not engage in any such energy trading activities 
the stated basis for instituting the investigation is information received during the audit which indicates there may have been violations of ferc regulations  specifically cfr section f  which requires that  to the extent supply corporation provides to a gas marketing affiliate information related to gas transportation  supply corporation must provide that information contemporaneously to all potential shippers 
ferc staff has indicated that they believe supply corporation violated this regulation by e mailing information describing daily operationally available capacity on its gas transportation system to a large number of shippers including one supply corporation marketing affiliate a few hours before that information was posted on supply corporation s website later that same day  supply corporation now provides such e mails after the information is posted on its website  and cfr section l  which requires that supply corporation must timely post on its website lists of gas marketing affiliates  organizational charts and job descriptions of various individuals supply corporation has updated this information 
supply corporation and its affiliates continue to cooperate with ferc staff by providing responses to multiple document requests in connection with this investigation and the preceding audit  and by making individuals available for interviews 
the company believes  based on the information presently known  that neither supply corporation nor any affiliate has received any benefit from any violations of ferc regulations which may have occurred  and that the ultimate resolution of this proceeding will not materially affect the company s operations or financial condition
