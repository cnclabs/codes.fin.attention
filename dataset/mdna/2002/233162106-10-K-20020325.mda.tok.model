item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide electronics design  development and manufacturing services to original equipment manufacturers and other electronics manufacturing service providers 
we target customers that are characterized by new product development programs demanding the rapid application of advanced technology and design 
time critical 
we can deliver highly complex printed circuit boards to customers in as little as hours 
approximately of our net sales for the year ended december  were generated from services delivered in days or less 
technologically advanced 
approximately of our net sales during the same period involved the design or manufacture of printed circuit boards with at least eight layers  an industry accepted measure of complexity 
in addition  many lower layer count boards are complex as a result of the incorporation of technologically advanced features 
growth rate 
our net sales have grown at a compound annual growth rate of for ddi capital and for ddi corp 
from million for the year ended december  to million for ddi capital and million for ddi corp 
for the year ended december   inclusive of the growth attributable to the acquisition of colorado springs circuits  inc  or nti  in  the merger with dynamic circuits  inc  or dci  in and the acquisitions of mcm electronics by ddi corp  automata and golden manufacturing in and the acquisitions of thomas walter  nelco technology  olympic circuits canada and altatron technology in company history and significant transactions our predecessor corporation was organized in in  we installed new management  headed by bruce d 
mcmaster  and began to focus primarily on time critical electronics manufacturing services 
recapitalization in october  we were recapitalized by investors led by bain capital  celerity partners and chase capital partners  which collectively invested million 
after completing the recapitalization  investment funds associated with these entities owned stock representing approximately of ddi corp 
s fully diluted equity  and management owned stock and options representing approximately of ddi corp 
s fully diluted equity 
in connection with the recapitalization  we incurred the following nonrecurring charges 
fees and interest charges on bridge loans aggregating million  
million for the accelerated vesting of variable employee stock options and related bonuses  
million for the early extinguishment of long term debt  before income taxes  and 
million for the buyout of our former ceo s employment contract 
colorado facility formerly nti in december  dynamic details acquired colorado springs circuits  inc  or nti  for approximately million 
nti manufactured printed circuit boards requiring lead times of twenty days or more for original equipment manufacturers 
at that time  the acquisition provided us with additional capacity and access to new customers 
we accounted for the nti acquisition under the purchase method of accounting and recorded approximately million in goodwill 
this goodwill was originally scheduled to be amortized over a period of years 
the unamortized balance as of october was reduced to zero  however  in connection with the closure of our texas facility 
from december through march  we implemented a plan to consolidate our colorado operations into our texas facility and to close our colorado facility  which operated at a loss in dci merger on july   dynamic details merged with dynamic circuits  inc  or dci  for an aggregate consideration paid to dci stockholders of approximately million 
a portion of the consideration was paid in cash  and the balance of the consideration approximately million was paid through the issuance of ddi corp 
capital stock 
concurrent with this transaction  ddi corp 
contributed its investment in dci through intermediate and through ddi capital to dynamic details 
dci provided design and manufacturing services relating to complex printed circuit boards  backpanel assemblies and electromechanical interconnect devices with operations in california  texas  georgia and massachusetts 
dci experienced a growth in net sales of more than during  and its net sales for the six months ended june  were more than double its net sales for the six months ended june  we accounted for the dci merger under the purchase method of accounting and recorded approximately million in goodwill  approximately million of identifiable intangible assets which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of years  using an accelerated method of amortization  reflecting the relative contribution of each developed technology in periods following the acquisition date  and approximately million and million  respectively  of intangible assets associated with dci s customer relationships and tradenames and assembled workforce assets which are being amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of years and years  respectively 
dynamic details also identified million of acquired in process research and development investments  which was expensed in the fourth quarter ended december  since the dci merger  we have continued to invest in the development of the various in process research and development technologies that existed at dci at the time of the merger 
we believe that our research and development efforts are reasonably consistent with dci s plans at the time of the merger  inclusive of the expected post merger total costs to complete the projects and related project development time frames  given the inherent uncertainties involved in estimating the technological hurdles of developing next generation technologies 
these investments have enabled us to market products incorporating some of the technologies included in dci s plan 
no significant adjustments have been made in the economic assumptions or expectations on which we based our merger decision 
in october  we approved a plan to close our garland  texas and marlborough  massachusetts facilities see note to the consolidated financial statements

garland  texas and marlborough  massachusetts facilities in october  our management and board of directors approved a plan to close our garland  texas and marlborough  massachusetts facilities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
prior to its closure  the garland plant had manufactured our lowest technology pre production volume printed circuit boards 
the marlborough plant provided electronic interconnect products to selected customers in the new england area 
our decision to close these facilities was based on their contribution to our financial objectives in as well as their expected contribution going forward 
accordingly  the plant closures are not expected to adversely impact our results of operations in future periods 
the closure of the facilities is estimated to be effectively completed by june  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are a the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and b that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 

valuation of long lived assets we assess the potential impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
changes in our operating strategy  such as the closure of a facility  can significantly reduce the estimated useful life of such assets 
in our and consolidated statements of operations  we recorded impairments of long lived assets resulting from plant closures see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  under a new accounting standard effective january   our goodwill and certain other intangible assets will no longer be subject to periodic amortization over estimated useful lives 
these assets are now considered to have an indefinite life and their carrying values are required to be assessed by us for impairment at least annually 
depending on future market values and other factors  these assessments could potentially result in impairment reductions of these intangible assets in the future 
see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding recently issued accounting standards 

inventory obsolescence we generally purchase raw materials in quantities that we anticipate will be fully used in the near term 
changes in operating strategy  however  such as the closure of a facility  can limit our ability to effectively utilize all of the raw materials purchased 
in our and consolidated statement of operations  we recorded restructuring related inventory impairments resulting from plant closures see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to evaluations of the market value in connection with significant activities  we regularly monitor potential inventory obsolescence and  when necessary  reduce the carrying amount of our inventory to its market value 

allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the process incorporates an assessment of the current tax exposure together with temporary differences resulting from different treatment of transactions for tax and financial statement purposes 
such differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
the recovery of deferred tax assets from future taxable income must be assessed and  to the extent that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
increases in valuation allowances result in the recording of additional tax expense 
further  if our ultimate tax liability differs from the periodic tax provision reflected in the consolidated statements of operations  additional tax expense may be recorded 

litigation and other contingencies management regularly evaluates our exposure to threatened or pending litigation and other business contingencies 
because of the uncertainties related to the amount of loss from litigation and other business contingencies  the recording of losses relating to such exposures requires significant judgment about the potential range of outcomes 
to date  we have not been affected by any litigation or other contingencies that have had  or are currently anticipated to have  a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
as additional information about current or future litigation or other contingencies becomes available  management will assess whether such information warrants the recording of additional expense relating to its contingencies 
such additional expense could potentially have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

tranche b term loan facility of up to an aggregate principal amount of pounds million  and 
working capital facilities of an aggregate maximum principal amount of pounds million the term loan facilities require ddi europe to meet financial ratios and to comply with other restrictive covenants 
substantially all of the assets of ddi europe are pledged as collateral under the ddi europe facilities agreement 
as of december   an aggregate of pounds million  or million  was outstanding under the facilities 
the tranche a term loan facility is repayable in increasing quarterly installments beginning in june with the final payment payable in september pursuant to an amendment in november  no payments are due on the tranche a term loan facility from october through february the tranche b term loan facility is repayable in full in december the working capital facility is available until november and may be renewed at bank of scotland s discretion 
borrowings under the facilities bear interest at varying rates  comprising of libor at the dates of commencement of the relevant quarterly interest period plus a margin of basis points for tranche a  tranche b and the working capital facility 
the agreement requires ddi europe to make interest hedging arrangements and consequently ddi europe has entered into an interest rate swap agreement covering of its borrowings under these facilities 
the overall effective interest rate for the ddi europe term loan facilities  after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreement  as of december   was 
ddi europe is required to pay non utilization fees on the average unused portion of each of the facilities 
ddi capital senior discount notes the ddi capital senior discount notes were issued in an aggregate principal amount at maturity of million and will mature on november  the senior discount notes were issued under an indenture dated as of november  between ddi corp  as issuer  and the state street bank and trust company  as trustee  as supplemented by the supplemental indenture dated as of february  between ddi capital and the trustee 
the senior discount notes are senior unsecured obligations of ddi capital

recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
and no 
sfas no 
business combinations requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations  establishes specific criteria for recognizing intangible assets separately from goodwill and requires certain disclosures regarding reasons for a business combination and the allocation of the purchase price paid 
sfas no 
is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  and for all business combinations accounted for using the purchase accounting method for which the date of acquisition is after june  sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets establishes that goodwill and certain intangible assets will not be amortized and the amortization period of certain intangible assets will no longer be limited to forty years 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets that are not amortized be tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas no 
is effective in fiscal years beginning after december  for acquisitions effective before june   we adopted both sfas no 
and no 
on january  we will also implement sfas no 
and sfas no 
for any acquisitions occurring after june  as part of the adoption of sfas no 
on january   we will no longer amortize goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives related to existing goodwill and intangible assets 
we expect that upon adoption of sfas no 
 we will no longer record annual fiscal year amortization associated with existing goodwill of approximately million 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
develops one accounting model for long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale  requires that long lived assets that are to be disposed by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell and expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that a can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and b will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal years beginning after december  and is therefore effective for us beginning with our fiscal quarter ending march  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements a number of the matters and subject areas discussed in this form k are forward looking in nature 
the discussion of such matters and subject areas is qualified by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations generally  and also may differ materially from our actual future experience involving any one or more of such matters and subject areas 
we wish to caution readers that all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this annual report on form k regarding our financial position and business strategy may constitute forward looking statements 
all of these forward looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions made by our management  which although believed to be reasonable  are inherently uncertain 
therefore  undue reliance should not be placed on such estimates and statements 
no assurance can be given that any of such estimates or statements will be realized and it is likely that actual results will differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which we may compete and fluctuations in demand in the electronics industry  ability to sustain historical margins as the industry develops  increased competition  increased costs  loss or retirement of key members of management  increases in our cost of borrowings or unavailability of additional debt or equity capital on terms considered reasonable by management  adverse state  federal or foreign legislation or regulation or adverse determinations by regulators  and inability to consummate acquisitions on attractive terms 
we have attempted to identify  in context  certain of the factors that we currently believe may cause actual future experience and results to differ from our current expectations regarding the relevant matter or subject area 
in addition to the items specifically discussed in the foregoing  our business and results of operations are subject to the rules and uncertainties described under the heading factors that may affect future results contained herein  however  the operations and results of our business also may be subject to the effect of other risks and uncertainties 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  items described from time to time in our reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
factors that may affect our future results substantial indebtedness we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 
as of december   our total debt was approximately million for ddi corp 
and million for ddi capital 
as of december   we had million available under the dynamic details senior credit facility and million available under the ddi europe revolving credit facility for future borrowings for general corporate purposes and working capital needs 
access to the full amount amount available under the dynamic details senior credit facility is subject to conditions set forth in the agreement 
in addition  subject to the restrictions in the ddi capital senior discount notes  the ddi europe facilities agreement and dynamic details senior credit facility  we may incur additional indebtedness from time to time to finance acquisitions or capital expenditures or for other purposes 
as a result of our level of debt and the terms of our debt instruments 
our vulnerability to adverse general economic conditions is heightened  
we will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to repayment of debt  limiting the availability of cash for other purposes  
we are and will continue to be limited by financial and other restrictive covenants in our ability to borrow additional funds  consummate asset sales  enter into transactions with affiliates or conduct mergers and acquisitions  
our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in its business and industry will be limited  
we are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates because some of our debt obligations are subject to variable interest rates  and 
our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired 
our ability to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control  as well as the availability of revolving credit borrowings under the dynamic details senior credit facility and the ddi europe facilities agreement or successor facilities 
we anticipate that our existing cash and marketable securities  operating cash flow  amounts available under our existing credit facilities and the proceeds of ddi corp 
s public offerings will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses and to service our debt requirements as they become due 
if we are unable to service our indebtedness  we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness  or seeking additional equity capital 
there is no assurance that we can effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms  or at all 
business cycles of the end markets we serve the end markets into which we sell printed circuit boards and electronic manufacturing services including communications and networking equipment  computers and peripherals  medical  automotive  industrial and test equipment  and aerospace equipment have their own business cycles 
some of these cycles show predictability from year to year 
however  other cycles  are unpredictable in commencement  depth and duration 
the communications industry entered into a significant downturn in late  which continues as of this date 
this has had a negative impact on our revenues and operating performance for the year ended december  and has continued to have a negative impact on our revenues and operating performance during the first quarter of the failure of such industries to recover  a worsening of the downturn  or any other event leading to additional excess capacity will negatively impact our revenues  gross margins and operating margins 
if our revenues and our operating performance do not improve significantly  there is significant risk that ddi europe and dynamic details will not be able to meet specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests  including a minimum ebitda covenant contained in the dynamic details senior credit facility 
as a result of the foregoing  we may be required to commence discussions with our lenders regarding forbearance agreements  additional amendments or waivers under  or a potential restructuring of  the dynamic details senior credit facility and our other indebtedness 
we do not currently have any agreement with any lenders with respect to any such forbearance  amendments  waivers or restructuring  and there can be no assurance that any such agreement could be obtained 
any increase in our debt service requirements or any reduction in amounts available for borrowing under the dynamic details senior credit facility or our other indebtedness could significantly affect our ability to meet debt service requirements  to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions  and working capital 
there can be no assurance that the dynamic details senior credit facility or our other indebtedness would be renegotiated on terms acceptable to us 
if we are not able to comply with the current financial covenant levels  we will not be able to borrow under the dynamic details senior credit facility  and the lenders under this facility will have the right to declare the outstanding borrowings under the facility to be immediately due and payable and the exercise of all or any of their other rights and remedies  including foreclosing on the collateral pledged to secure the facility  which consists of substantially all of the assets of dynamic details and its subsidiaries 
restrictions imposed by terms of indebtedness the terms of our indebtedness restrict  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments  consummate certain asset sales  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  merge or consolidate with any other person or sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets 
ddi europe  ddi capital and dynamic details are also required to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests 
our subsidiaries ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our subsidiaries control  and there can be no assurance that they will meet those tests 
depending on the specific circumstances  breach of any of these covenants may result in a default under some or all of our indebtedness agreements 
upon the occurrence of an event of default  lenders under such indebtedness could elect to declare all amounts outstanding together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
if we were unable to repay such amounts  the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
substantially all the assets of dynamic details and its subsidiaries are pledged as security under the dynamic details senior credit facility 
substantially all the assets of ddi europe are pledged as security under the ddi europe facilities agreement 
technological change and process development the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuing process development 
the future success of our business will depend in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities  to develop and market products and services that meet changing customer needs  and to successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost effective and timely basis 
research and development expenses are expected to increase as manufacturers make demands for products and services requiring more advanced technology on a quicker turnaround basis 
we are more leveraged than some of our principal competitors  and therefore may not be able to respond to technological changes as quickly as these competitors 
in addition  the electronics manufacturing services industry could in the future encounter competition from new or revised technologies that render existing technology less competitive or obsolete or that reduce the demand for our services 
we cannot assure you that we will effectively respond to the technological requirements of the changing market 
to the extent we determine that new technologies and equipment are required to remain competitive  the development  acquisition and implementation of such technologies and equipment may require us to make significant capital investments 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain capital for these purposes in the future or that any investments in new technologies will result in commercially viable technological processes 
dependence on a core group of significant customers although we have a large number of customers  net sales to our largest customer accounted for approximately of our net sales in net sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of our net sales during the same period 
we may depend upon a core group of customers for a material percentage of our net sales in the future 
substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
we cannot assure you that significant customers will order services from us in the future or that they will not reduce or delay the amount of services ordered 
any reduction or delay in orders could negatively impact our revenues 
in addition  we generate significant accounts receivable in connection with providing services to our customers 
if one or more of our significant customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay us for the services provided  our results of operations would be adversely affected 
variability of orders our operating results fluctuate because we sell on a purchase order basis rather than pursuant to long term contracts and we expect these fluctuations to continue in the future 
we are therefore sensitive to variability in demand by our customers 
because we time our expenditures in anticipation of future sales  our operating results may be less than we estimate if the timing and volume of customer orders do not match our expectations 
furthermore  we may not be able to capture all potential revenue in a given period if our customers demand for quick turnaround services exceeds our capacity during that period 
because of these factors  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance 
because a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed  even a small revenue shortfall can have a disproportionate effect on our operating results 
it is possible that  in future periods  our results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
this could cause the market price of ddi corp 
s common stock to decline 
competition the printed circuit board industry is highly fragmented and characterized by intense competition 
we principally compete with independent and captive manufacturers of complex quick turn and longer lead printed circuit boards 
our principal competitors include other independent small private companies and integrated subsidiaries of more broadly based volume producers that also manufacture multilayer printed circuit boards and other electronic assemblies 
some of our principal competitors are less highly leveraged than us and may have greater financial and operating flexibility 
competition in the complex quick turn and longer lead printed circuit board industry has increased due to the consolidation trend in the industry  which results in potentially better capitalized and more effective competitors 
our basic technology is generally not subject to significant proprietary protection  and companies with significant resources or international operations may enter the market 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on acquisition strategy as part of our business strategy  we expect that we will continue to grow by pursuing acquisitions of other companies  assets or product lines that complement or expand our existing business 
competition for attractive companies in our industry is substantial 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to finance and complete transactions that we select 
in addition  existing credit facilities restrict our ability to acquire the assets or business of other companies 
the attention of our management may be diverted  and operations may be otherwise disrupted 
if we fail to effectively execute this acquisition strategy  the growth of our revenues may suffer and the price of ddi corp 
s common stock may decline 
ability to integrate acquired businesses and manage expansion since december  we have completed a merger and acquired eight companies 
we have a limited history of owning and operating our businesses on a consolidated basis 
we cannot assure that we will be able to meet performance expectations without disrupting the quality and reliability of service to customers or diverting management resources 
our expected growth has placed and may continue to place a significant strain on our management  financial resources and information  operating and financial systems 
if we are unable to manage this growth effectively  our rate of growth and revenues may be adversely affected 
ability to process transferred orders at current margins during the fourth quarter of  we closed two of our manufacturing facilities which required us to transfer associated orders to other facilities 
this transfer has had a negative impact on our expected margins for these orders in the first quarter of and has negatively impacted our financial performance 
we can provide no assurance that this will not occur in the future if we pursue additional restructuring 
costs of international expansion we have expanded into new foreign markets and intend to continue our international expansion 
we completed our acquisitions of mcm electronics  a united kingdom company  and thomas walter limited  based in marlow  england  on april  and march   respectively 
we also acquired olympic circuits canada  based in canada  in may in addition  in april  we established dynamic details japan as a sales office in tokyo  japan 
entry into foreign markets may require considerable management time as well as  in the case of new operations  start up expenses for market development  hiring and establishing office facilities before any significant revenues are generated 
as a result  operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable 
we will be unable to utilize net operating losses incurred by foreign operations to reduce our us income taxes 
therefore  as we continue to expand internationally  we may not generate operating results consistent with historical performance  and the market price of ddi corp 
s common stock price may decline 
intellectual property our success depends in part on proprietary technology and manufacturing techniques 
currently  we do not rely on patent protection to safeguard these proprietary techniques but rely primarily on trade secret protection 
litigation may be necessary to protect our technology and determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of competitors 
intellectual property litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management and other resources 
if any infringement claim is asserted against us  we may seek to obtain a license of the other party s intellectual property rights 
we cannot assure you that a license would be available on reasonable terms or at all 
environmental matters our operations are regulated under a number of federal  state  local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern  among other things  the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water  as well as the handling  storage and disposal of such materials 
these laws and regulations include the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  as well as analogous state and foreign laws 
compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration for us because we use in our manufacturing process materials classified as hazardous such as ammoniacal etching solutions  copper and nickel 
in addition  because we are a generator of hazardous wastes  we may be subject to potential financial liability for costs associated with an investigation and any remediation of sites at which we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes if such sites become contaminated 
even if we fully comply with applicable environmental laws and are not directly at fault for the contamination  we may still be liable 
the wastes we generate include spent ammoniacal etching solutions  solder stripping solutions and hydrochloric acid solution containing palladium  waste water which contains heavy metals  acids  cleaners and conditioners  and filter cake from equipment used for on site waste treatment 
violations of environmental laws could subject us to revocation of its effluent discharge permits 
any such revocations could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities  thereby negatively impacting revenues and potentially causing the market price of ddi corp 
s common stock to decline 
dependence on key management we depend on the services of our senior executives  including bruce d 
mcmaster  president and chief executive officer 
we cannot assure that we will be able to retain him and other executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management in the future 
mr 
mcmaster is not a party to an employment agreement with us 
our business also depends on our ability to continue to recruit  train and retain skilled employees  particularly engineering and sales personnel  due to our focus on the technologically advanced and time critical segment of the electronics manufacturing services industry 
in addition  our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies depends in part on our ability to retain key management and existing employees at the time of the acquisition 
charter documents and state law provisions provisions in our charter and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management that stockholders consider favorable or beneficial 
if a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented  the market price of our common stock could suffer 
controlling stockholders investment funds affiliated with bain capital  inc beneficially own approximately of the outstanding common stock of ddi corp 
in addition  of the nine directors who serve on our board  three are current representatives of bain capital  inc and two are former representatives of bain capital  inc 
by virtue of such stock ownership and board representation  these entities will continue to have a significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders  including the election of our directors  and to exercise significant control over our business  policies and affairs 
such concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change of control or other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the ddi europe facilities agreement and the dynamic details senior credit facility bear interest at a floating rate  the ddi capital senior discount notes and ddi corp 
convertible subordinated notes bear interest at fixed rates 
we reduce our exposure to interest rate risks through swap agreements 
the dynamic details revolving credit facility bears interest at a per annum plus the applicable libor or b per annum plus the federal reserve reported overnight funds rate plus per annum 
as of december   we had no amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
based upon our anticipated utilization of the dynamic details revolving credit facility through the year ending december   a change in interest rates is not expected to materially affect the interest expense to be incurred on this facility during such period 
under the terms of the current swap agreement  we pay a maximum annual rate of interest applied to a notional amount equal to the principal balance of the term facility portion of the dynamic details senior credit facility 
from january  through december  we pay a fixed annual rate of  from january  through december   we pay a fixed annual rate of and from january  through the scheduled maturity of the tranche b term facility under the dynamic details senior credit facility in we pay a fixed annual rate of 
the term loan facility portion of the dynamic details senior credit facility bears interest based on one month libor 
as of december   one month libor was 
if one month libor increased by to  interest expense related to the term loan facility portion would not increase over the year ending december  due to the fixed rates under the swap agreements 
the overall effective interest rate for the term loans  after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreement  as of december   was 
under the terms of the current swap agreement  ddi europe pays a fixed annual rate of interest equal to applied to fixed amounts of debt per the agreement  through september as of december   the swap covers approximately of the outstanding debt under the facilities agreement 
based upon our anticipated utilization of the ddi europe revolving credit facility through the year ending december   a change in interest rates is not expected to materially affect the interest expense to be incurred on this facility during such period 
the ddi europe facilities agreement bears interest based on three month libor 
as of december   three month libor was 
if three month libor increased by to  interest expense related to the term loan facility would not increase due to the fixed rate of under the swap agreement 
the overall effective interest rate for the ddi europe term loan facilities  after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreement  as of december   was 
a change in interest rates would not have an effect on our interest expense on the ddi capital senior discount notes or ddi corp 
convertible subordinated notes because these instruments bear a fixed rate of interest 
foreign currency exchange risk the sales and expenses and financial results of ddi europe and of our canadian operations are denominated in british pounds and canadian dollars  respectively 
we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in those operations 
however  since nearly all of our sales are denominated in local currency or in us dollars  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency transaction risk with respect to sales made 
based on our fiscal forecast  the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have an impact on our operating results over the year ending december  we do not use forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures to foreign currency denominated transactions and do not utilize any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
