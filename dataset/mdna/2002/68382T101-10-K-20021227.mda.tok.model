item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes to such financial statements included elsewhere in this report beginning on page f the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the statements are based on current expectations and actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to the differences are discussed in business risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the our financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory write downs  and accrued expenses 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be adversely affected 
inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts 
if there is a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we may be required to write down our inventory and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
we use estimates in the determination of the required accrual for warranty costs 
this estimate is based upon a detailed examination of past experience and current information 
the information available to us may change in the future and may require us to revise this accrual 
we continually reassess our assumptions and judgments and make adjustments when significant facts and circumstances dictate 
historically  actual results have not been materially different than the estimates that are described above 
overview we design  manufacture and sell a comprehensive line of high performance  highly reliable fiber optic subsystems and modules for fiber optic transmission systems used to address the bandwidth limitations in man  lan  and san markets 
our subsystems and modules include optical transmitters  receivers  transceivers and transponders that convert electronic signals into optical signals and back to electronic signals  enabling high speed communication of voice and data traffic over public and private networks 
we began our operations and shipped our first products in november of and have been profitable every year since our inception 
furukawa beneficially owns all of our outstanding class b common stock  representing of our outstanding shares of common stock and of the combined voting power of all of our outstanding common stock as of the fiscal year ended september  since our inception  we have purchased substantially all of our lasers and the majority of our other fiber optic components from furukawa 
we have relied on furukawa s research and development capabilities to provide us with technologically advanced lasers and fiber optic components that we purchase from furukawa for inclusion in our products 
we currently purchase the majority of lasers from furukawa using short term purchase orders 

table of contents we operate in one industry segment  the design and manufacture of fiber optic subsystems and modules 
we sell our products to fiber optic communication equipment manufacturers  directly and through contract manufacturers  who incorporate them into systems they assemble for equipment manufacturers 
we define our customers as equipment manufacturers who have purchased our products directly or ordered our products for incorporation into systems produced by contract manufacturers 
we recognize revenue upon product shipment  and sales returns and allowances have been insignificant 
historically  a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant percentage of our revenue 
our largest customers accounted for approximately and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
cisco systems  alcatel  and nortel networks including sales to each of their contract manufacturers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended september  alcatel and cisco systems including sales to each of their contract manufacturers accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended september  no other customer accounted for more than of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended september  and for financial reporting purposes  we consider our customers to be the contract manufacturers and cems who place purchase orders with us or otherwise purchase our products directly 
for the fiscal year ended september   no direct sales customer accounted for more than of our total revenue 
cisco systems and alcatel usa sourcing lp accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended september  no other direct sales customer accounted for more than of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended september  although our revenue from sales to our other customers continues to increase  we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future 
our sales are made on a purchase order basis rather than by long term purchase commitments 
our customers may cancel or defer purchase orders without penalty on short notice 
in october  methode electronics  inc filed a lawsuit against infineon technologies corporation and us seeking unspecified damages  including monetary damages  injunctive relief  attorneys fees and costs arising from our alleged infringement of some of the claims contained in patents assigned to methode  including patents relating to our x pin configuration products 
after methode initiated the lawsuit  it assigned to stratos lightwave  inc  a methode spin off  all of methode s rights  title and interest in the patent at issue 
the court subsequently added stratos as a plaintiff to the lawsuit 
on april   we resolved our patent infringement litigation with stratos 
the settlement resolves all claims in the lawsuit among us and stratos 
as part of the settlement  we entered into a five year license agreement with stratos covering stratos portfolio of optoelectronic transceiver patents 
in consideration of the license agreement  we are required to pay a total of million over the license term 
our optoelectronic products covered by this license include our x  gbic  small form factor sff and small form factor pluggable sfp product families 
at the end of the five year term  we have the option to renegotiate with stratos for an extension of the license 
since early  the telecommunications sector  and in particular the fiber optic networking sector  has suffered a severe downturn 
system providers have scaled back on deployment and have dramatically slowed their purchases of systems from equipment manufacturers 
as a result  equipment manufacturers have also slowed purchases of components and modules from our competitors and from us 
moreover  as equipment manufacturers sales declined  they have relied on their excess component inventories to meet reduced demand and have moved to reduce their overall component and module inventory levels 
consequently  the slowdown continues to have a negative impact on our business as we face declining sales as a result of our customers declining business and the resulting adjustment to their inventory levels 
on october   we acquired certain assets of cielo communications  inc  a research and design company located in broomfield  colorado  focused on creating vcsel technology for fiber optic communication networks for a cash purchase price of million 
the purchase price includes the acquisition of capital equipment  inventory and intellectual property 
the average selling prices of our products generally decrease as the products mature from factors such as increased competition  the introduction of new products  increased unit volumes  and price concessions required 
table of contents by our customers 
we anticipate that average selling prices of our existing products will continue to decline in future periods although the timing and degree of the declines cannot be predicted with any certainty 
we must continue to develop and introduce new products that incorporate features that can be sold at higher average selling prices on a timely basis 
our cost of revenue consists principally of materials  as well as salaries and related expenses for manufacturing personnel  manufacturing overhead and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
we purchase several key components for our products from a limited number of suppliers 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for design engineers and other technical personnel  cost of developing prototypes  and depreciation of test and prototyping equipment 
our research and development expenses also consist of materials and overhead costs related to major product development projects 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
in october and in connection with our acquisition of certain assets of cielo communications  we leased a building in broomfield  colorado  which will serve as an additional research and design facility 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our future success 
accordingly  we intend to expand our internal research and development capabilities in the future to develop new products 
as a result  we expect that our research and development expenses in absolute dollar amounts and as a percentage of revenue will increase significantly in future periods 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  commissions paid to independent manufacturers representatives  product marketing and promotion costs 
we intend to substantially expand our sales and marketing operations and efforts  both domestically and internationally  in order to increase sales and market awareness of our products 
in july we opened sales offices in bury st 
edmunds  england and richardson  texas  in may we opened a sales office in ottawa  canada and in may we opened a sales office in santa clara  california 
we plan to establish sales offices in the eastern united states for our direct sales force that currently work from their homes 
we believe that investment in sales and marketing is critical to our success and expect these expenses to increase in the future 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for our administrative  finance and human resources personnel  professional fees and other corporate expenses 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase particularly due to the increase in our directors and officers insurance premiums as a result of market changes for such insurance coverage  and increases in our legal and consulting fees associated with analysis of strategic alternatives  including future market opportunities  that have been undertaken by our management and board of directors

this resulted in a decrease in demand from our customers and equipment manufacturers of their purchases of components and modules that we provide 
sales of our products for man decreased to approximately of revenue for the fiscal year ended september  from approximately of revenue for the fiscal year ended september  we expect our revenue to continue to be negatively affected by the economic downturn and its impact on the overall market growth in the foreseeable future 
in addition  the average selling prices for existing products may decline in response to product introductions by competitors or us  and pressure from our significant customers for price concessions 
cost of revenue cost of revenue decreased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  the decrease in cost of revenue in absolute dollars was primarily due to the decrease in revenue and a million decrease in excess inventory write downs 
the decrease in excess inventory write downs was primarily due to a decrease in overall inventory levels and an increase in inventory write downs in the fiscal year ended september  as a result of the industry slowdown and its impact on the demand for our products 
gross margin decreased from during the fiscal year ended september  to during the fiscal year ended september  the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to an increase of in salaries and related expenses for indirect manufacturing personnel and in direct labor costs as a percentage of revenue  both of which decreased in absolute dollars 
the increases in salaries and related expenses for indirect manufacturing personnel as a percentage of revenue were due to a decrease in production and the increase in direct labor costs as a percentage of revenue was due to a decrease in labor efficiency 
these increases as a percentage of revenue were partially offset by decreases as a percentage of revenue of in the cost of materials  in excess inventory write downs and in the warranty provision 
the decrease in material cost as a percentage of revenue was due to inventory that was used in production that was previously written down by approximately million as excess 
the decrease in the warranty provision as a percentage of revenues was due to a decrease in customer returns allowance required as a result of the decrease in revenue 

table of contents research and development research and development expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  this increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and other operating costs resulting from the hiring of additional engineering personnel 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to from over this period because of decreased revenue 
we expect research and development expenses to increase significantly in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue as we continue to expand our research and development efforts 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease of million in commissions to independent manufacturers representatives partially offset by increases of  in salaries and employee benefits resulting from the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel 
we believe that investment in sales and marketing is critical to our success and expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we expand our sales and marketing efforts 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  this increase was primarily due to a million increase in legal expenses and consulting fees related to our patent infringement litigation with stratos lightwave  inc and consulting services associated with an analysis of strategic alternatives  including future market opportunities  undertaken by our management and board of directors 
the increase was also due to a  increase in insurance expenses related to an increase in directors and officers insurance premiums 
these increases were substantially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense as a result of the decrease in revenue and the decrease in past due accounts 
we expect the dollar level of legal and consulting fees to increase as we continue to explore and evaluate strategic alternatives and expected increases in our directors and officers insurance premiums as a result of market changes for such insurance coverage 
income taxes the benefit for income taxes was  in the fiscal year ended september   compared to a provision for income taxes of million in the fiscal year ended september  the benefit for income taxes in the fiscal year ended september  was the result of tax benefits associated with our extra territorial elections 
fiscal years ended september  and revenue revenue increased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  this increase was due substantially to an increase in demand from our existing customers and  to a lesser extent  to demand from new customers and from revenue generated by newer products with higher average selling prices  such as our transponder products 
sales of our products for man increased to of revenue for the fiscal year ended september  from of revenue for the fiscal year ended september  during the fiscal year ended september   the telecommunications sector  and in particular the fiber optic networking sector  suffered a severe downturn

we believe that period to period comparisons of operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
some of the factors which could cause our operating results to vary include fluctuations in the demand for and sales of our products  the timing of customer orders  the cancellation of existing orders  competitive factors such as introductions of new products  our ability to develop  introduce and manufacture new products in a timely manner  our ability to

the following table sets forth revenue attributable to each of our product groups as a percentage of revenue for the periods presented 
fiscal years ended september  receivers transceivers transmitters other revenue we believe the increase in the percentage of sales attributable to our transceiver products during the periods reflected in the table above reflects an overall increase in customer demand for products designed with higher levels of integration  such as transponders 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   our primary source of liquidity was our cash and cash equivalents balance of million and million of marketable securities  which consist primarily of united states treasury notes and treasury bonds 
our unused revolving line of credit totaling approximately million provided an additional source of liquidity 
since inception  we have financed our operations primarily with cash generated from operations 
additional financing has been generated through lines of credit and term loans 
as of september   our working capital was million with a current ratio of as of september   our working capital was million with a current ratio of because of our low debt balances  we believe that additional cash could be borrowed if necessary  however  cash flow from operations  cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  and existing loan facilities are expected to be sufficient to fund operations for the next months 
as of september   we had a million balance outstanding under our term loan and no balance outstanding under our million revolving line of credit 
the term loan and the revolving credit facility bear interest on amounts outstanding at various time intervals and the market rates based on our election at a per annum rate equal to either a the prime rate or b libor plus 
the term loan matures in july  and the proceeds of the term loan were used to purchase our primary corporate and manufacturing facility in chatsworth  california 
the revolving credit facility can be used to fund working capital requirements 
the term loan and our revolving credit facility contain customary covenants  including covenants limiting indebtedness and the disposition of assets 
to secure our payment and performance obligations under the term loan we have pledged all of our assets as collateral 
the term loan and the revolving credit facility also require that we comply with financial covenants  which require us to maintain our tangible net worth  cash position and revenue at specified levels 
our need to comply with these covenants does not materially affect the operation of our business 
during the fiscal year ended september   we generated net cash flow from operations of million 
the cash generated by operating activities during this period was caused by increases in income after adding back adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided and decreases in accounts receivables and inventories 
these were partially offset by an increase in income tax benefits and a decrease in accounts payable and accounts payable to related parties 
for the years ended september  and  we generated net cash flow from operations of million and million  respectively 
the cash generated by operations in the 
table of contents year ended september  was caused by an increase in income and a decrease in accounts receivable  partially offset by increases in income tax benefits and other current assets and decreases in accounts payable and accounts payable to related parties 
the cash generated by operations in the year ended september  was caused by increased income  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
during the fiscal year ended september   cash provided by investing activities was million compared to cash used by investing activities of million for the same period in the prior year 
the increase in cash from investing activities for the fiscal year ended september  was due to a million increase resulting from maturities of marketable securities being greater than our purchases of marketable securities  partially offset by a million increase in capital expenditures for the purchase of property  plant and equipment to upgrade  expand and automate our manufacturing facility 
during the fiscal year ended september   cash used in investing activities was million and million  respectively 
the majority of cash used in investing activities was for the net purchase of marketable securities  the june  purchase of a  square foot building in woodland hills  california for million and capital expenditures for the purchase of property  plant and equipment to expand and automate our manufacturing facility 
as of september   we have committed to make capital expenditures totaling approximately  during the next six months  primarily to purchase additional equipment to develop new products 
during the fiscal year ended september   cash used by financing activities was  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the same period in the prior year 
the decrease in cash from financing activities for the fiscal year ended september  was due to a  reduction in long term debt  partially offset by  provided by the issuance of common stock for the exercise of employee stock options and stock plan purchases 
the increase in cash from financing activities for the fiscal year ended september  was primarily the result of the november  completion of our initial public offering of our class a common stock 
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and the offering expenses  we received net proceeds from the initial public offering of approximately of million 
on april   we resolved our patent infringement litigation with stratos lightwave  inc as part of the settlement  we entered into a five year license agreement with stratos covering stratos portfolio of optoelectronic transceiver patents 
in consideration of the license agreement  we are required to pay a total of million over the five year license term on october   we completed the acquisition of certain assets of privately held cielo communications  inc  a research and design company located in broomfield  colorado  for million 
the purchase price includes the acquisition of capital equipment  inventory and intellectual property 
on november   we completed an initial public offering of our class a common stock 
all  shares of class a common stock registered under the registration statement were sold at a price of per share  which amount includes exercise of the underwriters over allotment option of  shares 
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and the offering expenses  we received net proceeds from the initial public offering of approximately million 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments on hand  together with cash that we expect to generate from our operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need or elect to raise additional funds to fund our activities beyond the next year or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
we could raise such funds by selling more stock to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  
table of contents the ownership percentages of existing stockholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
although we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next twelve months  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including the market acceptance of our products  the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our new products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace  price discounts on our products to our customers  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and product and technology roadmaps  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  capital improvements to new and existing facilities  technological advances  our competitors response to our products  our pursuant of strategic alternatives  including future market opportunities  and our relationships with suppliers and customers 
in addition  we may require additional capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring  infrastructure and facility needs or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
inflation inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations  however  our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by inflation in the future 
subsequent events on october   we acquired certain assets of cielo communications  inc  a research and design company located in broomfield  colorado  focused on creating vcsel technology for fiber optic communication networks for a cash purchase price of million 
the purchase price includes the acquisition of capital equipment  inventory and intellectual property 
on november   john lemasters resigned from his position as chairman of the board of directors  but will remain a member of the board of directors and audit committee 
our board of directors re appointed dr 
muoi van tran  our president and chief executive officer  as chairman of the board of directors 
on november   masao konomi resigned from his position as a member of our board of directors  including his position on the audit and compensation committees 
we are not aware that mr 
konomi s resignation was the result of any disagreement on matters relating to the our operations  policies or practices including the policies and practices of our audit committee 
on december   our board of directors  pursuant to its authority under our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  approved an amendment to our bylaws to increase the range of the size of the board from three to seven directors to five to nine directors  and set the size of the current board at eight 
table of contents directors 
the board of directors also elected hobart birmingham and david warnes as members of the board  and also appointed them to serve on our audit committee 
mr 
birmingham was also appointed to serve on our compensation and special stock option committees 
our board of directors now consists of eight directors  including four independent directors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are currently exposed to interest rate risk on our existing term loan and revolving credit facility and on our investment portfolio 
our variable rate debt consists of term loan borrowing of million 
to date we have not utilized our floating rate debt under the revolving credit facility 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash and cash equivalents includes million invested in money market and other interest bearing accounts 
in addition  we have million invested in marketable securities  which represents investments in united states treasury notes and treasury bonds 
as of september   our investment in marketable securities had a weighted average time to maturity of approximately days 
marketable securities represent united states treasury notes and treasury bonds with a maturity of greater than three months 
these securities are classified as held to maturity because we have the intention and ability to hold the securities to maturity 
gross unrealized gains and losses on held to maturity marketable securities have historically not been material 
maturities on held to maturity marketable debt securities range from three months to two years 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease  the result would be an annual increase or decrease of interest expense of approximately  on our term loan and an annual increase or decrease of interest income of million on our investment portfolio 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no such action 
further  this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
foreign currency risk sales to foreign customers are denominated in us dollars and as such we have no foreign currency fluctuation risk
