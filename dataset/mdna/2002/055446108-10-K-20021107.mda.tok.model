accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets was issued in july and has been adopted by the company effective october  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead  such assets must be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with provisions of sfas no 
this statement also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 the company evaluated the recoverability of goodwill based upon undiscounted estimated future cash flows 
in connection with the sfas no 
transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the statement required that the company perform an assessment of whether there was an indication that goodwill was impaired as of the date of adoption  using a fair value model 
to accomplish this  the company was required to identify its reporting units and to determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of october  based upon a discounted cash flow analysis  the company concluded that the carrying value of its europe apc reporting unit exceeded its fair value and as such the related goodwill was impaired 
as a result  the company recognized a charge of  during the quarter ending december   to write off the goodwill of its europe segment in its entirety 
this write off has been recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the goodwill affected by this write off related to two transactions  both of which were acquisitions of the common stock of the target companies 
as such  there was no adjustment in the tax basis of the assets of such companies at the time of the acquisitions 
accordingly  no tax benefit can be recorded as a result of the write off of the related goodwill

the statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated 
the words should  believe  anticipate  expect  and other expressions that indicate future events and trends identify forward looking statements 
actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those anticipated depending on a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  competition  the performance of newly established domestic and international operations  demand and price for bha s products and services  general us and international business conditions and other factors 
you should consult the section entitled factors affecting earnings and stock price 
the company cautions that the foregoing lists of important factors is not exclusive 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates all of the company s indebtedness is at variable rates of interest 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate changes 
based upon borrowings outstanding at september   a fluctuation in market rates would impact interest expense by approximately  annually 
exchange rates the company views its equity investment in a foreign subsidiary as a long term commitment and does not hedge the translation exposures relative to such equity investments 
in addition to its equity investment  the company from time to time has u 
s 
dollar denominated trade payables and advances due from its international affiliates 
such amounts are subject to translation exposure 
at september   the amount of such unhedged exposures was less than million 
forward exchange contracts bha periodically enters into forward exchange contracts with commercial banks in order to fix the currency exchange rate related to intercompany transactions with its foreign subsidiaries 
changes in the value of these instruments due to currency movements offset the foreign exchange gains and losses of the corresponding intercompany transactions 
at september   the aggregate amount of such forward exchange contracts was approximately million  and the market value of these contracts was  lower than their face value 
accounts receivable the company s customer base operates in numerous industries in the us and internationally 
with the weakness in the global manufacturing economy  the company is seeing an increasing level of customer bankruptcies and slow payment problems that management believes have been appropriately reserved for 
although there is no significant concentration of sales in any one industry or with any individual customer  certain of the company s customers operate in industries such as steel  textile  and foundry  which have been severely impacted by the current economic environment 
additionally  the company executes significant projects and fulfills membrane supply contracts that can result in open receivables from individual customers that at times exceed million 
it is considered unlikely that the failure of one or more customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
however  if the current economic environment persists or deteriorates further  near term operating results could be adversely impacted by a further increase in bad debt expense
