item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as information contained in factors that may affect future results below and elsewhere in this report  contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements include statements concerning the future of our industry  our product development  our business strategy  our future acquisitions  the continued acceptance and growth of our products  and our dependence on significant customers 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
in some cases  these statements can be identified by terminologies such as may  will  expect  anticipate  estimate  continue  or other similar words 

table of contents although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements contained in this report are reasonable  they may be inaccurate 
in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward looking statements included herein  the inclusion of such statements should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements will be achieved 
overview we are a leading designer  developer and marketer of highly integrated digital system processor chips 
these chips are the primary processors driving digital video and audio players including dvd  video cd and mp players 
our chips use multiple processors and a programmable architecture that enable us to offer a broad array of features and functionality 
we believe that multi featured dvd players will serve as the platform for a digital home system  or dhs  integrating various digital home entertainment and information delivery products into a single box 
we are also a supplier of chips for use in modems and similar communication products  and a supplier of pc audio chips 
we outsource all of our chip fabrication and assembly as well as the majority of our test operations  allowing us to focus on our design and development strengths 
in april  our board of directors adopted a plan to distribute all of our shares of vialta  a startup company with historical losses that is developing a multi featured dvd player with internet connectivity and other advanced features 
the vialta spin off was completed on august  vialta is reported separately as a discontinued operation 
in february  we acquired netridium  a development stage company  for million in cash 
netridium is a developer of broadband communication products enabling high speed networking over existing phone lines in the home 
the acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the results of operations and cash flows of such acquisition have been included from the date of acquisition 
at the end of  we purchased acres of land in fremont  california  on which we built our corporate campus 
in october  we sold the remaining undeveloped acres of this land 
critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the company provides for rebates and future returns based on historical experiences at the time revenue is recognized 
actual expenses may be different from management s estimate  such differences  if any  are recorded in the period they become known 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined by the first in  first out method 
we write down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and market conditions 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
these charges have been included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  the company reviews long lived assets based upon a gross cash flow basis and will reserve for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
on january   sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  became effective 
this standard supersedes sfas no 
and requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effects on our financial statements 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of timing differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
us deferred income taxes are not provided on all un remitted earnings of the company s foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are considered permanently invested 
assumptions underlying recognition of deferred tax assets and non recognition of us income tax on un remitted earnings can change if our business plan is not achieved 
results of operations our consolidated financial information presents the net effect of the discontinued operation separate from the results of our continuing operations 
historical financial information has been reclassified to present consistently the discontinued operation 
the discussion and analysis that follows below generally focus on the continuing operations 
inflation has not had any material impact on our business to date 
the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net revenues years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development in process research and development selling  general and administrative operating income non operating income loss  net income before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income from continuing operations net revenues net revenues were million in  million in and million in net revenues decreased from to primarily due to the continuing softness in the pc marketplace  which more than offset the growth in our dvd business 
net revenues from to decreased by million in our pc audio business  decreased by million in our video cd chip business  increased by million in our dvd chip business and decreased by million in our communication and other businesses 
we expect our dvd chip business will continue to grow as a percentage of our net revenues  while 
table of contents our pc audio business continues to decline 
net revenues decreased from to primarily due to the softness in the pc marketplace and a decrease in average selling prices in the pc audio markets  which more than offset the growth in our communication business and our video business which consists of both our dvd chip and video cd chip product lines 
net revenues from to in our pc audio business decreased by million  and increased in our video business by million and million in our communication and other businesses 
international revenues accounted for approximately of net revenues in  of net revenues in and of net revenues in we expect that international sales will continue to remain a high percentage of our net revenues 
our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
percentage of net revenues years ended december  dvd video cd pc audio communication and other total gross profit gross profit was million in  million in and million in  representing corresponding gross margins of of net revenues in  of net revenues in and of net revenues in the decrease in gross margin from to was primarily due to the underabsorption of fixed overhead certain fixed costs remained relatively constant for the two periods  while production levels for were lower than for we recorded million of excess and obsolete inventory charges during  a decrease of million from we expect gross margins to return to historic levels in the future  based upon an increasing percentage of our sales generated by our higher margin dvd chip business 
the decrease in gross margin from to was primarily due to million in inventory charges in excluding the million inventory charges  gross margin would have been of net revenues in compared to of net revenues in  due to higher margin product mix partially offset by reduced average selling prices 
during  we purchased inventory based on our then current sales forecast and our intent to build up inventory on key products from our foundries due to a forecasted tight wafer capacity 
however  during  the overall market for pc products declined significantly  and  as a result  the demand for these products did not meet our forecasts resulting in those inventory charges described above 
as a result of intense competition in our markets  we expect the overall average selling prices for our existing products to decline over the product life 
we believe that in order to maintain or increase gross profit  we must achieve higher unit volume shipments  reduce costs  add new features and introduce new products 
operating expenses research and development research and development expenses were million  or of net revenues  in  million or of net revenues  in  and million  or of net revenues  in the increase in research and development expenses from to was the result of normal variations in project workload 
we expect that research and development will continue to be critical to our business as we introduce new products 
the decrease in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to a decrease in internal projects and reimbursement of consulting and other services provided to vialta 
operating expenses in included an additional million for in process research and development due to the purchase of netridium  which is not included in the foregoing research and development expenses 

table of contents selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net revenues  in  million  or of net revenues  in  and million  or of net revenues  in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses from to resulted primarily from the increase in legal expenses 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses from to resulted primarily from the completion of a co operative marketing campaign and a decrease in bad debt expenses partially offset by an increase in salary and legal expenses 
the company expects selling  general and administrative expenses will remain relatively constant  at approximately of net revenues in the foreseeable future 
non operating income loss  net net non operating income loss was million in  million in and million in in  net non operating loss consisted primarily of a million loss from the sale of  shares of cisco systems stock in june of  partially offset by interest income and rental income from vialta 
in  net non operating income consisted primarily of a pre tax gain of million on our exchange of preferred stock in komodo technology for restricted shares of common stock of cisco systems in september  in addition to a million gain from the sale of land and property  plant and equipment  and million of net interest income on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in  net non operating income consisted primarily of interest income 
income taxes during the fourth quarter of  we established a wholly owned foreign subsidiary in the cayman islands  british west indies  which has reduced our effective tax rate 
the company s effective tax rate was   and for   and  respectively 
our effective tax rate  excluding the provision taken on the exchange of komodo technology shares for cisco systems shares and subsequent sale of cisco systems stock  was for and for the company used an estimated tax rate on the million loss from sale of the investment  which resulted in an million tax benefit 
the tax rate for of was lower than the combined federal and state statutory rate of primarily as a result of the lower foreign tax rate on earnings from the company s foreign subsidiary that was considered to be permanently reinvested 
the tax rate for of was lower than the combined federal and state statutory rate of primarily as a result of the lower foreign tax rate on earnings from the company s foreign subsidiary that was considered to be permanently reinvested 
net income from continuing operations net income from continuing operations was million in  million in and million in the decreased net income from continuing operations during compared to was primarily due to the million loss incurred on sale of investments in  as compared to the million gain recorded in  the decrease in net revenues and the lower margin product mix 
the increased net income from continuing operations during compared to was primarily due to the million gain on the komodo investment and offset by an increase in inventory charges 
net loss from discontinued operation net loss from discontinued operation was million in  million in and million in the increased net loss from discontinued operation during compared to was primarily due to the million loss from disposal of discontinued operation recorded in the first quarter of for the estimated spin off cost and anticipated losses  net of minority interest  from operating the vialta business between april  and the estimated completion date for the spin off  which was completed earlier than estimated on august  the increased loss from discontinued operation during compared to 
table of contents was due to additional costs and expenses related to product development  expansion of operations and marketing activities of vialta 
eight quarters ended december  the following table sets forth our statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters ended december  all of the data presented has been restated to reflect vialta as a discontinued operation 
we believe that going forward we will be more seasonal  depending on the timing of customer orders and demand for the holiday season  which typically occur during the third and fourth quarters 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and working capital excluding net assets of the discontinued operation of million 
at december   we had a million unsecured line of credit  which will expire on may  we expect to be able to renew this line of credit 
this line of credit requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and operating results 
on december   we were in compliance with these borrowing criteria 
there were no borrowings under the line of credit at december  in  we generated million of cash from operating activities 
this amount resulted primarily from the selling of inventories 
we used million of cash in investing activities  which consisted primarily of a net purchase of short term investments  cash paid for the acquisition of sas  other long term investments and fixed asset purchases 
we used million of cash in financing activities  primarily as a result of using million to repurchase common stock offset by the receipt of million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans

this amount resulted from current year net income before non cash charges of million  increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  offset by an increase of current assets net of liabilities of million 
we used million of cash in investing activities  which resulted primarily from using million to purchase shares of vialta preferred stock  using million to buy property  plant and equipment and using million for the net purchase of short term investment 
we used million of cash for financing activities 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of december  together with short term investments  the cash generated from operations  available borrowings under our line of credit and other financing options  will be sufficient to fund acquisitions of property and equipment and provide adequate working capital through at least the next twelve months 
capital expenditures for the next twelve months are anticipated to be approximately million 
we may also use cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of or investment in such businesses  products or technologies owned by third parties 
on february   we announced that we had commenced a public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
we sold  shares  and  shares were sold by selling shareholders we did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling shareholders annie mh chan  the annie mh chan living trust and the shiu leung chan annie mh chan gift trust 
we received the net proceeds of  on february   which will be used for general corporate purposes  which may include acquisitions of companies  acquisitions of technology and capital expenditures 
pending such uses  we intend to invest the net proceeds from the offering in short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations  sfas 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
ess s management believes that the adoption of sfas will not have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles 
ess believes that the adoption of sfas will not have a significant impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
on october   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas supercedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas applies to all long lived assets including discontinued operations and consequently amends accounting principles board opinion no 
sfas develops one accounting model for long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale 
sfas requires that long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell 
additionally  sfas expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and will 
table of contents be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
sfas is effective for the company for all financial statements issued in fiscal factors that may affect future results our business is highly dependent on the expansion of the consumer electronics market 
we have shifted our primary focus from the pc audio business to developing products primarily for the consumer digital video market 
since the second half of  sales of video system processor chips to the dvd and video cd including vcd and svcd player markets accounted for a majority of our net revenues 
we expect that the consumer electronics market will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
however  our strategy in this market may not be successful 
given the large installed base of vcrs and other consumer electronics products  coupled with the current economic environment  consumer spending on dvd players and other home electronics may not grow as anticipated 
historically  sales of audio and modem chips to the pc market have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues 
however  we are no longer emphasizing this business and expect future sales in the pc market will continue to decline 
if the decline in our sales to the pc market is not offset by an increase in sales to the consumer electronics market  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the potential decline in consumer confidence and consumer spending that may be occasioned by terrorist attacks or armed conflict could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have not yet determined the ultimate effect of the recent terrorist attacks and armed conflict on our results of operations 
our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations that may cause volatility or a decline in the price of our stock 
historically  our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly 
our future quarterly operating results will likely fluctuate from time to time and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors in a particular future period 
the price of our common stock could decline due to such fluctuations 
the following factors may cause significant fluctuations in our future quarterly operating results changes in demand for our products  changes in the mix of products sold and our revenue mix  charges related to excess inventory  seasonal customer demand  increasing pricing pressures  gain or loss of significant customers  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  the timing of our and our competitors new product announcements and introductions  and the market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our and our customers products  the timing of significant customer orders  availability and cost of raw materials  significant increases in expenses associated with the expansion of operations  and availability and cost of foundry capacity 

table of contents we often purchase inventory based on sales forecasts and if anticipated sales do not materialize  we may continue to experience significant inventory charges 
we currently place non cancelable orders to purchase our products from independent foundries on an approximately three month rolling basis  while our customers generally place purchase orders with us that may be cancelled without significant penalty less than four weeks prior to delivery 
if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter are cancelled or do not occur as quickly as expected  expense and inventory levels could be disproportionately high and we may be required to record significant inventory charges in our statement of operations in a particular period 
we have experienced significant inventory charges in the past and we may continue to experience these charges in future periods 
our research and development investments may fail to enhance our competitive position 
we invest a significant amount of time and resources in our research and development activities to maintain and enhance our competitive position 
technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and the commitment of extensive engineering resources 
we incur substantial research and development costs to confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product that in the end may not be successful 
if we are not able to successfully complete our research and development projects on a timely basis  we may face competitive disadvantages 
there is no assurance that we will recover the development costs associated with these projects or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future research and development efforts 
one of our significant projects is the development of a next generation dvd system processor chip that will incorporate three independent processors and allow us to support additional features  including the linux  pocketpc formerly wince and vxworks operating systems 
this will require a new architecture and a complete system on a chip design  which is extremely complex and may not be ultimately feasible 
if we are unable to successfully develop this next generation dvd system processor chip  or complete other significant research and development projects  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we may need to acquire other companies or technologies to successfully compete in our industry and we may not be successful acquiring key targets or integrating these acquisitions with our business 
we will continue to regularly consider the acquisition of other companies or the products and technologies of other companies to complement our existing product offerings  improve our market coverage and enhance our technological capabilities 
there may be technologies that we need to acquire or license in order to remain competitive 
however  we may not be able to identify and consummate suitable acquisitions and investments 
acquisitions and investments carry risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  including the failure to integrate with existing products and corporate culture  the inability to retain key employees from the acquired company  diversion of management attention from other business concerns  the potential for large write offs  issuances of equity securities dilutive to our existing shareholders  and the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities 
our sales may fluctuate due to seasonality of customer demand 
our customers have experienced and may continue to experience significant seasonality in the sales of their products  which affects their orders of our products 
a majority of consumer home electronics products are sold during the holiday season 
consequently  as more of our chips are sold into the consumer electronics market  we expect a disproportionate amount of our sales to occur in the third and fourth quarters 

table of contents our products are subject to increasing pricing pressures 
the markets for most of the applications for our chips are characterized by intense price competition 
the willingness of original equipment manufacturers  or oems  to design our chips into their products depends  to a significant extent  upon our ability to sell our products at cost effective prices 
we expect the average selling prices of our existing products to decline significantly over the life of each product as the markets for our products mature and competition increases 
if we are unable to reduce our costs sufficiently to offset declines in product prices or are unable to introduce more advanced products with higher margins  our gross margins may decline 
we may lose business to competitors who have significant competitive advantages 
our existing and potential competitors consist principally of large domestic and international companies that have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  greater intellectual property rights  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than we have 
our competitors also include a number of independent and emerging companies who may be able to better adapt to changing market conditions and customer demand 
in addition  some of our current and potential competitors maintain their own semiconductor fabrication facilities and could benefit from certain capacity  cost and technical advantages 
dvd and video cd players face significant competition from video on demand  vcrs and other video formats 
in addition  we expect that the dvd platform for the digital home system will face competition from other platforms including set top boxes  as well as multi function game boxes being manufactured and sold by large companies 
some of our competitors may be more diversified than us and supply chips for multiple platforms 
a decline in dvd sales may have a disproportionate affect on us as we shift our focus to this market 
any of these competitive factors could reduce our sales and market share and may force us to lower our prices  adversely affecting our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is dependent upon retaining key personnel and attracting new employees 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of fred sl chan  our chairman of the board  and robert l 
blair  our president and ceo 
in the past  mr 
chan has served as our president and chief executive officer besides being our chairman of the board and currently he serves as the chairman of the board of vialta  our former subsidiary 
mr 
chan is critical to maintaining many of our key relationships with customers  suppliers and foundries in asia 
the loss of the services of mr 
chan  mr 
blair  or any of our other key executives could adversely affect our business 
we may not be able to retain these employees and searching for their replacements could divert the attention of other senior management and increase our operating expenses 
we currently do not maintain any key person life insurance 
to manage our future operations effectively  we will need to hire and retain additional management personnel  design personnel and software engineers 
we may have difficulty recruiting these employees or integrating them into our business 
if we lose the services of a significant number of our management personnel  design personnel or software engineers  the implementation of our business strategy could be disrupted 
our customer base is highly concentrated  so the loss of a major customer could adversely affect our business 
a substantial portion of our net revenues has increasingly been derived from sales to a small number of our customers 
during  sales to our top five customers increased to approximately of our net revenues  which includes sales through dynax electronics  our largest distributor 
we expect this concentration of sales to continue along with other changes in the composition of our customer base 
the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more major customers or the loss of one or more major customers could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  any difficulty in collecting amounts due from one or more key customers could harm our financial condition 

table of contents we rely on a single distributor for a significant portion of our revenues and if this relationship deteriorates our financial results could be adversely affected 
during  sales through dynax electronics  our largest distributor  increased to approximately of our net revenues 
dynax electronics is not subject to any minimum purchase requirements and can discontinue marketing any of our products at any time 
in addition  dynax electronics has rights of return for unsold product and rights to pricing allowances to compensate for rapid  unexpected price changes 
our business would be adversely affected if our relationship with dynax electronics deteriorates or their financial condition were to decline 
as our business grows  we may increasingly rely on distributors  which may reduce our exposure to future sales opportunities and impede our ability to accurately forecast product orders 
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use and we may be subject to claims of infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
to protect our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures 
as of december   we had patents granted in the united states 
these patents will expire over time commencing in and ending in in addition  as of december   we had corresponding foreign patents  which are going to expire over time commencing in the patents expiring in consist of two audio related japanese patents and ending in we cannot assure you that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or applications in preparation or that any claims allowed from pending applications or applications in preparation will be of sufficient scope or strength 
we may not be able to obtain patent protection in all countries where our products can be sold 
also  our competitors may be able to design around our patents 
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we cannot assure you that the actions we have taken to protect our intellectual property will adequately prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions 
litigation by or against us could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation results in a favorable determination for us 
any claim  even if without merit  may require us to spend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or cross licensing arrangements  which may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
we may be required to pay substantial damages or cease the use and sale of infringing products  or both 
in general  a successful claim of infringement against us in connection with the use of our technologies could adversely affect our business 
in particular  if we lose either of the related modem cases  our results of operations could be significantly harmed 
we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation our business could be materially harmed 
we have significant international sales and operations that are subject to the special risks of doing business outside the united states 
substantially all of our sales have been to customers in hong kong  taiwan  china  korea  japan  malaysia  and singapore 
during  sales to customers in hong kong  taiwan and china were in excess of of our net revenues 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenues 
in addition  substantially all of our products are manufactured  assembled and tested by independent third parties in asia 
there are special risks associated with conducting business outside of the united states  including unexpected changes in legislative or regulatory requirements and related compliance problems  lack of adequate protection of our intellectual property rights  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  including changes in most favored nations trading status  tariffs  quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  
table of contents longer payment cycles and greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection  potentially adverse taxes  difficulties in obtaining export licenses for technologies  language and other cultural differences  which may inhibit our sales and marketing efforts and create internal communication problems among our us and foreign counterparts  and currency exchange risks 
our products are manufactured by independent third parties 
we rely on independent foundries to manufacture all of our products 
substantially all of our products are currently manufactured by taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  ltd  or tsmc  and by united microelectronics corporation  or umc 
our reliance on these or other independent foundries involves a number of risks  including the possibility of an interruption or loss of manufacturing capacity  reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs  and the inability to reduce our costs as rapidly as competitors who perform their own manufacturing and who are not bound by volume commitments to subcontractors at fixed prices 
any failure of these third party foundries to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested  could damage our relationships with our customers and harm our sales and financial results 
to address potential foundry capacity constraints in the future  we may be required to enter into arrangements  including equity investments in or loans to independent wafer manufacturers in exchange for guaranteed production capacity  joint ventures to own and operate foundries  or take or pay contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods 
these arrangements could require us to commit substantial capital or to grant licenses to our technology 
if we need to commit substantial capital  we may need to obtain additional debt or equity financing  which could result in dilution to our shareholders 
because we purchase raw materials from a limited number of suppliers  we could experience disruptions or cost increases 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers to obtain adequate supplies of quality raw materials on a timely basis 
we do not generally have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers 
if we have difficulty in obtaining materials in the future  alternative suppliers may not be available  or if available  these suppliers may not provide materials in a timely manner or on favorable terms 
if we cannot obtain adequate materials for the manufacture of our products  we may be forced to pay higher prices  experience delays and our relationships with our customers may suffer 
we have extended sales cycles  which increase our costs in obtaining orders and reduce the predictability of our earnings 
our potential customers often spend a significant amount of time to evaluate  test and integrate our products 
our sales cycles often last for several months and may last for up to a year or more 
these longer sales cycles require us to invest significant resources prior to the generation of revenues and subject us to the risk that customers may not order our products as anticipated 
in addition  orders expected in one quarter could shift to another because of the timing of customers purchase decisions 
any cancellation or delay in ordering our products after a lengthy sales cycle could adversely affect our business 

table of contents our products are subject to recall risks 
the greater integration of functions and complexity of our products increases the risk that our customers or end users could discover latent defects or subtle faults in our products 
these discoveries could occur after substantial volumes of product have been shipped  which could result in material recalls and replacement costs 
product recalls could also divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development needs and could adversely impact our customer relationships 
in addition  we could be subject to product liability claims that could distract management  increase costs and delay the introduction of new products 
the semiconductor industry is subject to cyclical variations in product supply and demand 
the semiconductor industry is subject to cyclical variations in product supply and demand 
downturns in the industry have been characterized by abrupt fluctuations in product demand  production over capacity and accelerated decline of average selling prices 
current trade association data indicate that the semiconductor industry has experienced a severe downturn since the third quarter of and this downturn may continue for the foreseeable future 
this downturn could harm our net revenues and gross margins if average selling prices continue to decline or demand falls 
we cannot assure you that the market will stabilize or improve in the near term 
a prolonged downturn in the semiconductor industry could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations 
our success within the semiconductor industry depends upon our ability to develop new products in response to rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological changes  evolving industry standards and product obsolescence 
our success is highly dependent upon the successful development and timely introduction of new products at competitive prices and performance levels 
the success of new products depends on a number of factors  including anticipation of market trends  timely completion of product development  design and testing  market acceptance of our products and the products of our customers  offering new products at competitive prices  meeting performance  quality and functionality requirements of customers and oems  and meeting the timing  volume and price requirements of customers and oems 
our products are designed to conform to current specific industry standards  however we have no control of future modifications to these standards 
manufacturers may not continue to follow the current standards  which would make our products less desirable to manufacturers and reduce our sales 
our success is highly dependent upon our ability to develop new products in response to these changing industry standards 
we operate in highly competitive markets 
the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological changes  price reductions and rapid product obsolescence 
competition typically occurs at the design stage  when customers evaluate alternative design approaches requiring integrated circuits 
because of shortened life cycles  there are frequent design win competitions for next generation systems 
we expect competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets with products that may be provided at lower costs or provide higher levels of integration  higher performance or additional features 
advancements in technology can change the competitive environment in ways that may be adverse to us 
for example  today s high performance central processing units in pcs have enough excess computing capacity to perform many of the functions that formerly required a separate chip set  which has reduced demand for our pc audio chips 
the announcements and commercial shipments of competitive products could adversely affect sales of our products and may result 
table of contents in increased price competition that would adversely affect the average selling prices and margins of our products 
the following factors may affect our ability to compete in our highly competitive markets the price  quality and performance of our products and the products of our competitors  the timing and success of our new product introductions and those of our customers and competitors  the emergence of new multimedia standards  the development of technical innovations  ability to obtain adequate foundry capacity and sources of raw materials  the rate at which our customers integrate our products into their products  the number and nature of our competitors in a given market  and the protection of our intellectual property rights 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risks we fund our operations with cash generated by operations  the sale of marketable securities and short and long term debt 
as we operate primarily in asia  we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  which could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in order to reduce the risk from fluctuation in foreign exchange rates  our product sales and all of our arrangements with our foundry and test and assembly vendors are denominated in us dollars 
we have not entered into any currency hedging activities 
interest rate risks we also invest in short term investments 
consequently  we are exposed to fluctuation in rates on these investments 
increases or decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair value of these investments 
in addition  the credit worthiness of the issuer  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument  and other general market conditions may affect the fair values of interest rate sensitive investments 
in order to reduce the risk from fluctuation in rates  we invest in highly liquid governmental notes and bonds with contractual maturities of less than two years 
all of the investments have been classified as available for a sale  and at december   the fair market value of our investments approximated their costs 
risk associated with investment we are exposed to fluctuations due to changes in the market price of shares of cisco systems we hold as marketable securities 
since we do not use hedging instruments  these fluctuations could have an adverse impact on our net income should we decide to sell our remaining cisco shares for a loss
