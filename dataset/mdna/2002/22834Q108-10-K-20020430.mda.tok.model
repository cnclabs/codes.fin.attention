retail securities services we have approximately  retail customer accounts  which we service through licensed registered representatives  of whom also hold higher licenses as registered securities principals 
our clients consist of individuals and institutions  many of whom are sophisticated securities investors and who have maintained their accounts with us for a lengthy period of time 
our retail customer accounts are carried on a fully disclosed basis by investec ernst securities corp  members of the new york and other principal stock exchanges  pursuant to a clearing agreement

our investment banking professionals bring vast experience to the evaluation of developmental and growth companies who  in our judgment  have the potential  through business  management  proprietary assets and other factors  to become successful public enterprises 
among our activities in this field  we assist early capital formation and the structuring of security offerings 
we bring value to these clients by assisting their business plans  growth strategies  and expansion potential while also identifying and advising them as to strategic alliances  mergers  acquisitions and divestitures

we have also acted as manager or co manager for various offerings of municipal bonds and as participants in selling groups  increasing our ability to offer this type of investment to our clients 
our fixed income department also advises certain retail and institutional clients on investments in municipal  government and corporate bonds 
online trading we formed emeyerson 
com inc emeyerson in to take advantage of the acceptance and growth of online trading by retail and institutional clients 
in fiscal the markets clearly turned bearish and the need for additional online brokerage services diminished 
subsequently we merged emeyerson 
com with a sister company of an unaffiliated broker dealer  viewtrade securities  inc viewtrade 
viewtrade develops and markets retail and institutional online market access to and between foreign and domestic securities markets and financial institutions 
post merger the company owns approximately of the outstanding common stock of viewtrade holding corporation  the parent company of viewtrade 
corporate strategy as we enter our rd year  market making remains the core of our business 
consistent with the past  our goal is to enhance our historic strengths while expanding our product base and capabilities 
we plan to do this by combining sophisticated training with the latest electronic trading and information technology 
we have increased our trading platform and access to markets and information to meet the new trading demands 
we have  among other things  linked a number of automated trading systems to our network 
our investment banking activities are being expanded to cover raising private placement or other funding for small but dynamically expanding entities  while sometimes investing in these operations to secure a minority position in the shareholdings for our firm 
analyzing the needs of clients involved in these fields so that we may advise them in acquiring other operations or expanding their activities to encompass other related businesses which utilize the same basic technology and skills 
strategic alliances with other institutions since we view the securities industry and financial industries in general as involved in a global consolidation phase both horizontally by taking on a variety of banking  financial and securities products and vertically by linking up european  far eastern and american firms we intend to explore these possibilities for ourselves as well 
we will do this so that we are able to offer our retail and institutional clients a wider variety of products  we gain access to other products and overseas markets for our customers  and we are able to make available to overseas parties the ability to gain access to us securities markets and financial products 
in this way  we seek to add value for our stockholders  provide greater services for our clients  and participate in new product and the consolidation of securities and financial firms globally 
the movement to greater communications resources and electronic commerce  through the internet and otherwise  has accelerated these trends 
we intend to participate  but only after carefully examining the risks and potential rewards involved so that we are not exposing ourselves to significantly greater financial risk in the implementation of our strategic plans 
we also will move forward only if we are able to assure ourselves and our clients of being able to continue to provide at least the same personalized and professional servicing of their financial needs and accounts that we have historically provided to them 
operations we do not hold client funds or securities and do not directly process back office operations 
we clear transactions for certain institutional clients and transactions for our own proprietary trading accounts with spear  leeds kellogg  inc  members of the new york stock exchange and other principal stock exchanges 
we clear proprietary fixed income transactions  all transactions for our retail customers and transactions for additional institutional clients with investec ernst securities corp 
all clearing activities are carried on a fully disclosed basis with our customers 
these clearing services are furnished to us and our clients for a fee and include billing  custody of securities  credit review including for margin accounts and similar activities 
however  if our customers do not pay or deliver securities for a trade or if they do not properly maintain their credit balances on margin accounts  and there is a loss for which we cannot collect from our customer  we are generally liable for such losses 
we maintain our back office and compliance divisions to supervise our activities generally and to ensure financial and regulatory compliance with applicable rules 
vendors we use numerous third party vendors to obtain information services and software  including stock quotations  stock trading charts  news and financial data 
we have alternate sources for these services and  accordingly  do not consider ourselves dependent on any one or more of these suppliers 
we review our relationships with our vendors regularly and replace certain vendors as needed to maintain the most cost effective and efficient network available for our traders and representatives 
competition the securities industry is very competitive and  with technical innovation  is becoming even more so 
accordingly  we seek to compete based upon our traditional strengths built up on an over forty year period of time 
these strengths are o quality of execution o efficiency o training o reliability of our trading abilities o our reputation in the markets and with other market professionals o relationships with our institutional and retail clients o our skilled and experienced management team we also utilize what we consider the best and most reliable of technological advances in order to compete and continually enhance the quality of services provided 
we are competing with large and small brokerage firms  which utilize both traditional methods and electronic commerce to transact their business 
we encounter intense competition in all aspects of the securities business and compete directly with other securities firms  a significant number of which have substantially greater capital and other resources 
many of these competitors offer a wider range of financial services 
our strategy to bridge this gap is to focus on our core businesses of execution services and create alliances with third party market product vendors thus broadening our product line without the need for significant capital outlay 
in addition to competition from firms currently in the securities business there has recently been increasing competition from other sources such as commercial banks and insurance companies offering financial services 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the securities industry are the quality and ability of professional personnel and relative prices of services and products offered 
we and our competitors also directly solicit potential customers and furnish investment services to investors in an effort to hold and attract existing and potential clients 
government regulation the securities industry in the united states is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws 
we are registered as a broker dealer with the sec 
much of the regulation of broker dealers has been delegated to self regulated organizations  principally the nasd and national securities exchanges such as nasdaq 
these self regulatory organizations adopt rules subject to approval by the sec that govern the industry and conduct periodic examinations of our operations 
securities firms are also subject to regulation by state securities administrators in those states in which they conduct business 
regulatory bodies are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors participating in those markets  but not with protecting the interests of our stockholders 
broker dealers are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business  including sales methods  trade practices among broker dealers  use and safekeeping of clients funds and securities  capital structure  record keeping and the conduct of directors  officers and employees 
net capital requirements the sec  nasd and various other regulatory agencies have rigid rules requiring the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities brokers  including the sec s uniform net capital rule which we must comply with 
net capital is defined as assets minus liabilities plus other allowable credits and qualifying subordinated borrowings less mandatory deductions that result from excluding assets that are not readily convertible into cash and from valuing other assets  such as a firm s positions in securities  on a stringent basis 
among these deductions are adjustments in the market value of securities to reflect the possibility of a market decline prior to disposition 
as of january   we were required to maintain minimum net capital  in accordance with sec rules  of  and had total net capital of approximately  or approximately  in excess of our minimum net capital requirements 
if we fail to maintain the required net capital we may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec and suspension or expulsion by the nasd and other regulatory bodies 
in addition  a change in the net capital rules  the imposition of new rules  a specific operating loss  or any unusually large charge against net capital could limit operations that require the intensive use of capital and could limit our ability to expand our business 
the net capital rules also could restrict our ability to withdraw capital  which could limit our ability to pay dividends  repay debt and repurchase shares of our outstanding stock 
personnel as of march   we employed a total of full time persons  whose primary roles are trading  retail representatives  back office personnel  fixed income  investment banking  compliance  accounting  retail clerical  and in executive management 
our relations with our employees are generally good and we have no collective bargaining agreements with any labor unions 
our registered representatives are required to take and pass examinations and fulfill additional required continuing education requirements administered by the nasd and state authorities in order to be qualified to transact business 
our success will depend on our ability to hire and retain additional qualified trading  technical and financial personnel  who are generally in high demand 
item properties

compensation and benefits clearance charges communications professional fees occupancy and equipment costs other operating expenses total expenses income before income taxes minority interest provision for income taxes net income represents amount less than calculation of earnings per share the calculation of earnings per share on the financial statements included in this report are based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding  as calculated 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year total revenues in fiscal year decreased to  from  or 
this is attributable mainly to the decrease in trading revenue  underwriting and interest and other revenue and a decrease in commission revenue of 
the decrease in trading revenue is due to the overall market conditions and reflects a decline in the level of transactions initiated by our correspondents and the decrease in margins brought about by intensified competition 
trading margins were further decreased by the decimalization of the u 
s 
securities markets 
compensation and benefits decreased to  from  a change of 
this is reflective of a decrease in revenue for the year as producing personnel derive the major portion of their compensation as a percentage of production 
further  reductions in staff as part of an overall effort to reduce operating expenses resulted in cost benefits 
clearing charges decreased from  to  this was due primarily to the decrease in volume over last year and the company s ability to negotiate more favorable rate schedules with our respective clearing brokers 
communications expense decreased by  from  to  this reduction was accomplished by reducing equipment and services that  with the reduction in trading volume  became unnecessary 
other operating expenses  comprising professional fees  research fees  occupancy  and various other operating costs decreased from  to during the second quarter of fiscal  the company disposed of its interest in emeyerson 
com through a merger with an affiliate of viewtrade  inc originally  the company had invested  and owned an approximately interest in emeyerson 
com

com 
the fiscal financials reflect the unconsolidation of emeyerson 
com through a reduction in stockholders equity of  the reduction resulted from the effects of unconsolidating the previously consolidated accounts of emeyerson 
com 
the company s interest in viewtrade holding corporation after the merger is approximately and is valued at its original cost of  fiscal year compared with fiscal year total revenues in fiscal year increased to  from  or 
this was attributable mainly to the increase in trading revenue  with increases also in underwriting and interest and other revenue  offset by a small decrease in commissions 
the increase in trading revenue is mainly due to the very high trading volume during the first few months of the fiscal year 
compensation and benefits increased from  to  a change of 
this was caused by the increase in revenue 
clearing charges increased from  to  a change of caused by the increase in volume over the previous year 
communications expense increased by  from  to  other operating expenses  comprising professional fees  research fees  occupancy and various other operating costs increased from  to  viability of operating results the company  like other securities firms  is directly affected by general economic conditions and market conditions  including fluctuations in volume and price levels of securities  changes in levels of interest rates and demand for the company s investment banking services 
in addition  trading charges have been reduced and decimalization of stock quotations has had an adverse effect on revenues 
all of these factors have an impact on the company s net gain from securities transactions  underwriting  and commission revenues 
in periods of reduced market activity  profitability can be adversely affected because certain expenses  consisting primarily of non officer compensation and benefits  communications and occupancy and equipment remain relatively fixed 
liquidity and capital resources the company s statements of financial position reflect a liquid financial position as cash and assets readily convertible to cash represent and of total assets at january  and january   respectively 
the company finances its operations primarily with existing capital and funds generated from operations 
the company s consolidated statement of financial condition comparing fiscal and reflects an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses to  from  included in fiscal is the amount of  the amount awarded by an nasd arbitration panel against the company and bear stearns securities corp 
and described in item legal proceedings 
all other items totaled  compared with  in the prior year 
this reduction is representative of the decrease in overall business volume for the year and various cost cutting efforts 
the company believes that existing capital and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements 
if the company was compelled to settle any material issue incidental to the regular course of business  then and only then would the company seek additional funds 
management  however  believes all material items have been included in this report on form k and should result in no material adverse effect 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market making activities expose us to significant risks  including but not limited to changes in price and or liquidity of our trading positions 
we use an automated trading system to provide management with a real time overview of our traders activity  positions  and profitability 
each trader s total positions are regularly reviewed and limited by management 
this automated trading system also alerts management to any trades which exceed certain parameters as to position or trade size during the day 
in the course of our business  we maintain inventory  consisting mainly of nasdaq and otc securities and municipal bonds 
the market value of our inventory at january  was million in long positions and million in short positions 
the loss to the company  assuming a decline in prices  would be million due to the losses on the long positions being partially offset by gains on the short positions 
we invest  from time to time  in certificates of deposit and or maintain interest bearing balances in our accounts with our clearing brokers  for working capital purposes  which are classified as cash equivalents and receivables from clearing brokers  respectively  in the statement of financial condition
