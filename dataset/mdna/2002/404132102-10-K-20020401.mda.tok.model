item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we primarily receive our revenue from earned premium derived from our insurance company operations  management fees generated by our underwriting agency operations  commission income produced by our intermediary operations  investment income from all of our operations and capital and other operating income 
our core underwriting activities involve providing life  accident and health  aviation  marine  energy and property  and other specialty lines of insurance and reinsurance  each of which is marketed by our insurance companies and our underwriting agencies either directly to customers or through a network of independent or affiliated agents and brokers 
during the past several years  we have substantially increased our shareholders equity through the issuance of equity securities and through our retaining of earnings  thereby enabling us to increase the underwriting capacity of our insurance companies 
with this additional equity  we increased underwriting activity across many of our core lines of business  emphasizing lines of business and individual opportunities with the most favorable underwriting characteristics at a particular point in the insurance cycle 
as an insurer  we also purchase reinsurance for each of our lines of business 
we purchase different types of reinsurance in amounts we consider appropriate for each of our lines of business based upon market conditions and the level of risk we wish to retain 
currently  our underwriting agencies underwrite life  accident and health  contingency including contest indemnification  event cancellation  and weather coverages  directors and officers liability  individual disability for athletes and other high profile individuals  kidnap and ransom and professional liability insurance and other specialty lines of business on behalf of our insurance companies and unaffiliated insurance companies 
our underwriting agency activities are fee based and non risk bearing 
in conjunction with the expansion of underwriting activities by our insurance companies and in an effort to increase the efficiency of certain of our operations  we consolidated the operations of certain of our agency operations with those of certain of our insurance companies in and these consolidations will result in a reduction in management fee income and the net earnings from our underwriting agency segment  but such reduction should be more than offset over time by increases in net earnings of our insurance company segment 
our intermediaries are fee based  non risk bearing and place reinsurance for our insurance companies and underwriting agencies and for other non affiliated insurance companies and risk taking entities  as well as insurance on behalf of medium and large corporate clients 
other operating income has been generated through our insurance services operations  which supported our own operations as well as provided services for other clients 
additionally  other operating income may include the equity in the earnings of a company in which we invest  dividends or gains or losses from the disposition of these investments 
in  we sold the last of our service operations  which will result in a decrease in other operating income in future years 
from through  in response to adverse market conditions  we focused our acquisition activities on expanding our underwriting agency and intermediary operations for three principal reasons to provide a future source of premium revenue to our insurance companies in existing and new specialty lines of business and greater control of premium distribution channels  to insulate us from a decline in our revenue growth rate as insurance premium rates became more competitive in our specialty lines of business and we became more selective in our underwriting  resulting in reduced earned premium  to increase the management fees and commission income components of our total revenue  which we believed were a more predictable and stable source of revenue than the potential underwriting gain from insurance company operations during periods of overly competitive pricing 
late in  primarily due to a reduction in reinsurance capacity  rates began to increase  particularly in our life  accident and health  and aviation lines of business 
these market conditions continued to improve during and and also in our marine  energy and property line of business 
this improvement accelerated after the september terrorist attacks and we expect this to continue in in response to these changing market conditions  we plan to continue to expand our underwriting activities 
during december   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of the centris group  inc in a transaction recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
during october   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of asu international  llc and marshall rattner  inc and its operating subsidiary  professional indemnity agency  inc  which were also transactions recorded for using the purchase method of accounting 
the results of operations and cash flows of these three companies are included in our consolidated results beginning on the effective date of each transaction 
during january   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of the schanen consulting group  llc 
this business combination has been recorded using the pooling of interests method of accounting 
our consolidated financial statements have been restated to include the accounts and operations of the schanen consulting group  llc for all periods presented 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain premium revenue information for the three years ended december  in thousands direct    reinsurance assumed    gross written premium    reinsurance ceded    net written premium    change in unearned premium    net earned premium    the following table sets forth the relationships of certain income statement items as a percent of total revenue for the three years ended december net earned premium management fees commission income net investment income net realized investment gain loss other operating income total revenue loss and loss adjustment expense  net net operating expense interest expense earnings before income tax provision income tax provision net earnings before accounting change year ended december  versus year ended december  total revenue increased to million for compared to the increase in the insurance company segment revenue resulting from increased business  greater retention levels and higher investment income was offset primarily by a reduction in the underwriting agency segment revenue as we consolidated the operations of three of our underwriting agencies into the operations of our insurance companies on january  we anticipate that total revenue will continue to increase in as earned premium continues to grow and revenue from recent acquisitions is included in our consolidated financial statements 
net investment income was million for compared to million in the positive effect on investment income of our higher level of invested assets was offset by a significant decrease in interest rates in we expect positive operating cash flow to continue in  thereby increasing invested assets and investment income  but the increase could again be substantially offset by the effect of continued low interest rates 
during  we recorded a net realized investment gain of million  compared to a loss of million in during we recognized a million realized loss from the write down of five investments to their estimated fair market value compared to a similar write down of million from one equity investment during the loss from write downs during was offset by other gains recorded on investments sold 
during  we experienced three significant gross losses 
the largest loss was as a result of the terrorist attacks on september  which produced the biggest loss to our insurance company operations in our history 
although we had no involvement in the insurance coverages of the airlines involved  we had significant exposure in our accident and health reinsurance account 
our estimates of ultimate exposure were developed through a review of policy coverages  consideration of the effect on the estimate if the attacks were considered multiple events rather than a single event  and communications from our clients and producers 
we also have participations in property coverage on the world trade center and some of the surrounding buildings 
in addition  we anticipate some claims from other business written in the new york city area 
we also received some reported claims and estimates of losses for others 
we have utilized this information together with known coverage and reinstatement premium information to establish our gross and net losses reserve of million and million  respectively 
a charge for the net amount has been included in our consolidated financial statements 
we continue to monitor the reserve and believe our estimates to be reasonable  but they may be subject to adjustment as we receive additional information  which could take several years to finalize 
in addition  we have reviewed the estimated reinsurance recoverables related to this loss and believe that they are collectible in the normal course of business 
over of the total amount of reinsurance recoverables from this loss are due from companies and lloyds syndicates  each of which is rated a or better by either am best company  inc or moody s investors services  inc the other two losses were the petrobras brazilian offshore energy production platform and total chemical factory near toulouse  france incidents  which produced gross losses of million and million  respectively 
because these policies were substantially reinsured  the net losses were not material to our results of operations 
the petrobras loss was paid during the third quarter of and all reinsurance recoverables related to it have been collected 
we expect the reinsurance recoverables related to the total loss to be collected in due course once the original claim is settled 
during  we recorded a charge totaling million related to lines of business that we are exiting  mainly our primary workers compensation line of business 
the composition of this charge is million for loss and loss adjustment expense  million for net policy acquisition costs and million for other operating expense 
included in other operating expense is million related to the impairment of goodwill associated with the primary workers compensation line of business 
the fair value of this line of business was calculated based upon the present value of future expected cash flows 
compensation expense decreased to million for from million in the decrease is due principally to the disposition of non core subsidiaries  the subsequent closing or reduction of some operations of an acquired company and efficiencies gained from the consolidation of some of our underwriting agency operations with those of our insurance companies 
other operating expense for included million from charges related to lines of business being exited 
excluding these charges  other operating expense in was somewhat reduced for the same reasons as compensation expense  but to a much lesser extent  and the decrease was offset by a general increase in expenses in our operating subsidiaries as business grew 
in addition  guarantee fund and other assessments increased million in compared to other operating expenses for also included a credit of  reflecting the reversal of some restructuring charges recorded during the previous year  whereas during we recorded  in merger expense resulting from an acquisition 
currency conversion gains amounted to  in  compared to losses of  in interest expense was million for down from million in this decrease resulted from our use of the proceeds from our march  public offering of common stock and part of our august  offering of convertible notes to pay off our debt under the bank facility  lower interest rates and the low interest rate on our newly issued convertible notes 
income tax expense on earnings before the change in accounting was million for down from million for primarily due to the reduction in pre tax income 
the unusual effective tax rate for of compared to for  primarily results from the charge for the impairment of goodwill related to our exit from the primary workers compensation line of business 
that charge was not deductible for income tax purposes 
net earnings before the change in accounting was million  or per diluted share  for compared to million  or per diluted share  in this decrease primarily results from the after tax loss from the september terrorist attacks of million  or per diluted share  and the after tax charge for lines of business being exited of million  or per diluted share 
our book value per share was as of december   up substantially from as of december  segments insurance companies gross written premium increased to billion for from million in with strong growth in the life  accident and health line of business and  to a lesser extent  in the marine  energy and property line of business  as rates continue to rise  offset by a planned decrease from exited lines 
gross written premium growth is not our focus in  as we are able to grow our revenue simply by retaining more of the business we currently write 
net written premium for increased to million compared to the previous year  as our insurance companies have increased retentions on many of their lines of business as underwriting profitability improves 
net earned premium increased to million for the same reason 
the increase in net written premium and net earned premium is expected to continue in loss and loss adjustment expense increased to million for compared to million in substantially due to losses and expenses arising from the september loss and the charge related to lines of business being exited 
the net loss ratio in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles was excluding the september loss and the charge related to lines of business being exited for compared to in the medical stop loss line of business continues to have significantly improved underwriting results 
the gross loss ratio in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles was excluding the september  petrobras and total losses and the charge related to lines of business being exited in compared to for the petrobras and total claims were substantially reinsured and did not have a material effect on our net loss ratio or net earnings 
the combined ratio in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles was excluding the september loss and the charge related to lines of business being exited in compared to for during  we had net loss and loss adjustment expense redundancy of million relating to prior year losses compared to a redundancy of million in and we had gross loss and loss adjustment expense deficiency of million compared to a redundancy of million in the gross deficiency for resulted from rate reported loss information received during these losses primarily came from assumed reinsurance business written by one of our insurance companies 
the other deficiencies and redundancies result from our continued review with our actuaries of loss reserves and the increase or reduction of such reserves as losses are finally settled and claims exposures are reduced 
we continue to believe we have provided for all material net incurred losses 
policy acquisition costs  which are net of ceding commissions on reinsurance ceded  increased somewhat to million during compared to during  our insurance companies charged higher policy issuance fees on certain lines of business which are recorded as a reduction in acquisition costs 
this reduction in costs is offset by the increase in policy acquisition costs resulting from higher earned premium and part of the charge from lines of business being exited 
the net loss of our insurance companies was million in compared to net income of million for the results include after tax losses from september of million and expenses of million 
underwriting agencies management fees decreased to million for compared to million in much of the decrease is the result of our consolidation of the operations of three of our underwriting agencies into the operations of our insurance companies effective january  additional decreases are due to lines of business either sold or exited and increased retentions of our insurance companies 
net earnings of our underwriting agencies decreased to million for from million in for the same reasons 
we expect management fees before eliminations and net earnings of our underwriting agency segment to grow in due to organic growth and recent acquisitions 
intermediaries commission income was million for compared to million in commission income decreased due to general market conditions and less ceded reinsurance being placed on behalf of our insurance companies as they increased their retentions 
net earnings of our intermediaries decreased to million for compared to million in the decrease in net earnings was partly caused by our acquisition of the schanen consulting group  llc who was not subject to income taxes during prior to our ownership  but reflected in our historical results due to pooling of interest accounting and less commission income as a result of the mix of business  which had a lower gross margin during the current year  somewhat offset by a lower effective tax rate 
other operations the decrease in other operating revenue to million for from million in results principally from the disposition or closure of certain non core operations 
during  we recorded gains of million from the sale of other operating investments compared to million for the increase in gains was somewhat offset by loss of revenue included in the period related to operations that have since been closed or disposed of 
net earnings of other operations were million in up from million in for the same reasons 
period to period comparisons may vary substantially depending on other operating investments  or dispositions of such investments  in any given period 
as of december   all operating entities included in this segment had been sold or closed so revenue is expected to decrease substantially in corporate the net loss of the corporate segment was million for compared to a net loss of million in this improvement resulted from the reduction of interest expense as we paid off our debt under the bank facility by using the proceeds from the march  public offering of common stock and the august  offering of convertible notes  lower bank interest rates and the low interest rate on our newly issued convertible notes 
also included in the amounts for were the costs of the closing of some operations of an acquired company 
year ended december  versus year ended december  our total revenue increased to million in compared to this revenue increase resulted from the higher retention of premium underwritten by our insurance companies  particularly in the medical stop loss line of business  and increased investment income 
our net investment income increased to million in compared to this increase was primarily due to a higher level of invested assets which resulted from the greater retentions of premium underwritten by our insurance companies  the investment of cash received during the first quarter of from our commutation with a reinsurer and cash flow from operations 
in  we engaged general re new england asset management  a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway  inc and a nationally prominent investment advisor  particularly to insurance companies  and undertook an in depth review and restructuring of our investment portfolio 
as a part of this restructuring  we shortened our investment portfolio s duration but did not significantly change the average credit rating 
our net realized investment losses from sales or write downs of equity securities was million in  compared to losses of million in in  we recognized a million realized loss from the write down of an equity investment to its estimated fair market value based upon market quotations compared to a similar write down of million in our net realized investment gains from the disposition of fixed income securities were  in  compared to losses of  in our compensation expense increased to million during from million in this increase reflects a normal progressional increase due to business growth plus the increase due to the centris group  inc acquisition  offset by the savings resulting from the fourth quarter restructuring and the sale of non core subsidiaries 
other than the restructuring expenses discussed below  other operating expenses increased to million from million for similar reasons 
included in other operating expense are restructuring expenses of  in and million in currency conversion losses amounted to  in  compared to gains of  in our interest expense was million in compared to million in this increase is a result of higher interest rates and increased debt outstanding  principally as a result of funding the centris group  inc acquisition 
our income tax expense was million in compared to million in our effective tax rate was in the period compared to in most of the increase in the effective tax rate was due to non deductible goodwill amortization relating to the centris group  inc acquisition  a shift of fixed income investments to taxable instruments from tax exempt instruments and increased underwriting agency income which is subject to state income taxes 
our net earnings in increased to million or per diluted share from million or per diluted share in these increases result principally from improved underwriting results  an increase in investment income and the effects of the provision for reinsurance and a larger restructuring expense recorded during in  we incurred a million after tax charge for a change in accounting principles to conform our agency and intermediary revenue recognition principles to those required by the guidance in securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin number entitled revenue recognition in financial statements 
the change was not material to earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change for our book value per share was as of december   up from as of december  segments insurance companies gross written premium generated by our insurance companies increased to million in compared to due to new business  rate increases  increased participation by our insurance companies in the business underwritten by our underwriting agencies and the acquisition of the centris group  inc net written premium generated by our insurance companies in increased to million compared to  as our insurance companies have increased retentions in many of their lines of business as underwriting results showed improvement 
net earned premium increased to million during for the same reasons 
loss and loss adjustment expense incurred by our insurance companies increased to million in from million in the increase in net loss and loss adjustment expense is due to the higher level of net retained premium  net of the effect of improved underwriting results 
the net loss ratio in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles decreased to in from in in  we also recorded a million increase in reserves for exited lines of business acquired with our acquisition of the centris group  inc this increase represents of the net loss ratio 
the gross loss ratio in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles decreased to in from in the general improvement in our loss ratios results from the effects of increased premium rates in certain lines of business  reduced writings in other unprofitable lines of business and a general improvement in market conditions  particularly in the domestic aviation and medical stop loss lines of business 
the combined ratio in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of our insurance companies was for compared to excluding effects of the provision for reinsurance in during  we had net loss and loss adjustment expense redundancy of million relating to prior year losses compared to a deficiency of million in and we had gross loss and loss adjustment expense redundancy of million compared to a deficiency of million in the gross deficiency results from two principal conditions 
the first is the development of large claims on individual policies which were either reported late or for which reserves were increased as subsequent information became available 
however  as these policies were substantially reinsured  there was no material effect to our net earnings 
secondly  during in connection with the insolvency of one of the our reinsurers and with the commutation  finalized subsequent to year end  of all liabilities with another  we re evaluated all loss reserves and incurred but not reported loss reserves related to business placed with these reinsurers to determine the ultimate losses we might conservatively expect 
these reserves were then used as the basis for the determination of the provision for reinsurance recorded in the other deficiencies and redundancies in the reserves result from our continued review with our actuaries of loss reserves and the increase or reduction of such reserves as losses are finally settled and claims exposures are reduced 
we continue to believe we have provided for all material net incurred losses 
policy acquisition costs  which are net of commissions on ceded reinsurance  increased to million during from million for this increase in costs results from higher retained premium and the resulting reduced ceding commissions 
net earnings of our insurance companies increased to million in from a loss of million in  primarily as a result of improved underwriting results  the effect of the provision for reinsurance recorded in and the increase in investment income 
underwriting agencies management fees generated by our underwriting agencies increased to million in compared to this increase resulted primarily from the increased premium volume in the medical stop loss line of business  which was due to rate increases and the centris group  inc acquisition 
the increase in management fees was disproportionate to the increase in premium as a result of higher policy issuance fees and increased retentions by our insurance companies which reduced management fees earned by our underwriting agencies 
these reductions are offset by an equal reduction in net policy acquisition costs of our insurance companies 
net earnings of our underwriting agencies increased to million in from million in due to increased revenue  a smaller restructuring charge in than in and higher pretax margins primarily as a result of the successful integration of the centris group  inc acquisition 
intermediaries commission income decreased to million in from million in net earnings of our intermediaries decreased to million in from million in these decreases were due to a significant reduction in the amount of ceded reinsurance placed on behalf of our insurance companies as a result of their planned increase in retentions 
other operations other operating revenue decreased to million during from million for the same period in net earnings of our other operations decreased to million in from million in revenue and earnings can vary considerably from period to period depending on investment or disposition activity 
corporate the net loss of the corporate segment was million in compared to a net loss of million in this resulted from the increase of interest expense not allocated to the operating segments during as well as costs of the closing of some operations of a company acquired in late restructuring as of december   we accrued a restructuring liability of million related to our ongoing operations 
as of december   all restructuring costs had been paid or adjusted with the exception of a remaining liability of  during  we determined that one of the leased offices scheduled to be closed would be retained 
therefore  we reversed  included as a credit in other operating expenses in the consolidated financial statements of the restructuring expense recorded during the fourth quarter of  of which  was the reversal of the accrual for future lease payments and  was the reversal of the write off of certain assets 
as of december   we had also accrued a restructuring liability related to our acquisition of the centris group  inc changes in the accrual between december  and december  are shown in the table below in thousands accrued at paid in accrued at adjustments contractual executive severance accruals   other severance accruals lease obligation accruals    total     the adjustments in were recorded as management decided to take additional steps to integrate parts of the centris group  inc operations 
as of december   all amounts have been paid except for a million lease obligation 
during the fourth quarter of  we also recorded a restructuring charge and associated expenses of million 
a total of employees were terminated as a result of our restructuring of certain underwriting agency operations and their integration into our insurance company operations 
the charges affected both segments and consisted of  accrued severance pay to be paid at various times throughout and  for the write down or write off of various impaired assets  primarily redundant computer software 
liquidity and capital resources we receive substantial cash from premiums  reinsurance recoverables  and management fee and commission income and  to a lesser extent  investment income  and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments and other assets 
our principal cash outflows are for the payment of claims and loss adjustment expenses  payment of premiums to reinsurers  purchase of investments  debt service  and payment of policy acquisition costs  operating expenses  income and other taxes and dividends 
variations in operating cash flows can occur due to timing differences in either the payment of claims and the collection of related recoverables or the collection of receivables and the payment of related payable amounts 
we limit our liquidity exposure by holding funds  letters of credit and other security such that net balances due to us are less than the gross balances shown in our condensed consolidated balance sheets 
we maintain a substantial level of cash and liquid short term investments which are used to meet anticipated payment obligations 
our consolidated cash and investment portfolio increased million  or during  and totaled million as of december   of which million was cash and short term investments 
the increase in investments resulted primarily from operating cash flows and the million in capital contributions we made to our insurance companies in total assets increased to billion as of december  our investment portfolio includes a high percentage of liquid investments and generates a significant amount of investment income  which serves as a source of cash flow 
the average tax equivalent yield on investments was in  compared to in the weighted average duration of the portfolio was four years as of december  over of our fixed income securities were rated a or better by standard poor s corporation 
the value of our portfolio of fixed income securities is inversely correlated to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  some of our fixed income securities have call or prepayment options 
this could subject us to reinvestment risk should interest rates fall or issuers call their securities and we reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates 
we mitigate this risk by investing in securities with varied maturity dates  so that only a portion of our portfolio will mature at any point in time 
on march   we sold million shares of our common stock in a public offering at a price of per share 
net proceeds from the offering amounted to million after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses and were used to pay down our bank facility 
on august   we issued an aggregate million principal amount of convertible notes due in a public offering 
each  principal amount of notes is convertible into shares of our common stock  which represents an initial conversion price of per share 
the initial conversion price is subject to change under certain conditions 
interest is to be paid by us on march and september each year 
holders may surrender notes for conversion into shares of our common stock in any calendar quarter if  as of the last day of the preceding calendar quarter  the closing sale price of our common stock for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the quarter is more than currently per share of the conversion price per share of our common stock on the last trading day of the quarter 
we can redeem the notes for cash at any time on or after september  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes on september      and if the holders exercise this option  we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash  in shares of our common stock  or a combination thereof 
we paid million in underwriting discounts and expenses in connection with the offering  which are being amortized from the issue date until september  we used the proceeds from this offering to repay our remaining indebtedness under the bank facility  assist in financing the recent acquisitions  make a million capital contribution to our principal insurance companies and for general corporate purposes 
on december   we entered into a million revolving loan facility with a group of banks 
at our request  the amount available under the facility was reduced to million by an amendment on june  we can borrow up to the maximum amount allowed by the facility on a revolving basis until the facility expires on december  outstanding advances under the facility bear interest at agreed upon rates  which ranged between and as of december  the facility is collateralized in part by the pledge of the stock of two of our principal insurance companies  houston casualty company and avemco insurance company  and by the stock of and guarantees entered into by our principal underwriting agencies and intermediaries 
the facility agreement contains certain restrictive covenants  including minimum net worth requirements for us and certain of our subsidiaries  restrictions on certain extraordinary corporate actions  notice requirements for certain material occurrences and required maintenance of specified financial ratios 
we believe that the restrictive covenants and our obligations that are contained in the facility agreement are typical for financing arrangements comparable to our facility 
as of december   there was no outstanding balance on this facility 
as of december   certain of our subsidiaries maintained revolving lines of credit with a bank in the combined maximum amount of million available through december  advances under the lines of credit are limited to amounts required to fund draws  if any  on letters of credit issued by the bank on behalf of the subsidiaries and short term direct cash advances 
the lines of credit are collateralized by securities having an aggregate market value of up to million  the actual amount of collateral at any one time being of the aggregate amount outstanding 
interest on the lines is payable at the bank s prime rate of interest at december  for draws on the letters of credit and prime less on short term cash advances 
as of december   letters of credit totaling million had been issued to insurance companies by the bank on behalf of our subsidiaries  with total securities of million collateralizing the lines 
the following is a summary of our contractual cash payment obligations as of december  in thousands payments by due date total thereafter convertible notes   bank facility other notes payable     operating leases     see preceding paragraphs and notes and in notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information of these obligations 
the convertible notes have various put dates beginning september  the following is a summary of our various commitments and their expirations as of december  in thousands commitment expiration by period total outgoing letters of credit   mortgage guarantee   investment commitments   total commitments     the principal assets of hcc insurance holdings  inc are the shares of capital stock of our insurance companies 
historically  we have not relied on dividends from our insurance companies to meet the obligations of the parent holding company  which are primarily outstanding debt and debt service obligations  dividends to shareholders and corporate expenses  but  rather  we have had sufficient cash flow from our underwriting agencies and intermediaries to meet our cash flow requirements 
the payment of dividends by our insurance companies is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries 
property and casualty insurance companies domiciled in the state of texas are limited in the payment of dividends to their shareholders in any twelve month period  without the prior written consent of the commissioner of insurance  to the greater of statutory net income for the prior calendar year or of its statutory policyholders surplus as of the prior year end 
dividends may only be paid out of statutory unassigned surplus funds 
during  houston casualty company s ordinary dividend capacity will be approximately million and us specialty insurance company s ordinary dividend capacity will be zero 
under the laws of the state of maryland  avemco insurance company may only pay dividends out of statutory earned surplus 
the maximum amount of dividends that avemco insurance company may pay without prior regulatory approval in any twelve month period is the lesser of its statutory net investment income excluding realized capital gains for the prior calendar year or of its statutory policyholders surplus as of the prior year end 
during  avemco insurance company will have an ordinary dividend capacity of approximately million 
hcc life insurance company is limited by the laws of the state of indiana in the amount of dividends it may pay in any twelve month period  without prior regulatory approval  to the greater of its statutory net gain from operations for the prior calendar year or of its policyholders surplus as of the prior year end 
during  hcc life insurance company s ordinary dividend capacity will be approximately million 
as of december   we had a net deferred tax asset of million compared to million as of december  due to our history of consistent earnings  expectations for future earnings and taxable income in carry back years  we expect to be able to fully realize the benefit of our net deferred tax asset 
we have a reserve of million as of december  for potential collectibility issues related to reinsurance recoverables and associated expenses 
the adverse economic environment in the worldwide insurance industry and the terrorist attacks on september have placed great pressure on reinsurers and the results of their operations 
ultimately  these conditions could affect reinsurers solvency 
historically  there have been insolvencies following a period of competitive pricing in the industry  such as the marketplace has experienced for the last several years 
while we believe that the reserve is adequate based on currently available information  conditions may change or additional information might be obtained that would affect our estimate of the adequacy of the level of the reserve and which may result in a future change in the reserve 
we continually review our financial exposure to the reinsurance market and continue to take actions to mitigate our position 
a number of reinsurers have delayed or suspended the payment of amounts recoverable under certain reinsurance contracts to which we are a party 
such delays have affected  although not materially to date  the investment income of our insurance companies  but not to any extent their liquidity 
we limit our liquidity exposure by holding funds  letters of credit or other security such that net balances due are significantly less than the gross balances shown in our consolidated balance sheets 
in some instances  the reinsurers have withheld payment without reference to a substantive basis for the delay or suspension 
in other cases  the reinsurers have claimed they are not liable to for payment to us of all or part of the amounts due under the applicable reinsurance agreement 
we believe these claims are without merit and expect to collect the full amounts recoverable 
we are currently in negotiations with most of these parties  but if such negotiations do not result in a satisfactory resolution of the matters in question  we may seek or be involved in a judicial or arbitral determination of these matters 
in some cases  the final resolution of such disputes through arbitration or litigation may extend over several years 
in this regard  as of december   our insurance companies had initiated litigation or arbitration proceedings against five reinsurers and were involved in one arbitration proceeding initiated by a reinsurer 
these proceedings primarily concern the collection of amounts owing under reinsurance agreements 
as of such date  our insurance companies had an aggregate amount of million which had not been paid to us under the disputed agreements and we estimate that there could be an additional million of incurred losses and loss expenses under the subject agreements 
in addition  because our insurance companies  principally houston casualty company  participated in facilities which were managed by one of our underwriting agencies  they are indirectly involved in any reinsurance disputes which affect the applicable facilities 
as of december   houston casualty company s allocated portion of aggregate amounts which had not been reimbursed to the applicable facilities under the disputed agreements was million and we estimate that there could be an additional million of incurred losses and loss expenses under the subject agreements allocated to houston casualty company 
houston casualty company has no net exposure on disputed amounts due to the non affiliated companies who also participated in the applicable facilities 
regulatory guidelines suggest that a property and casualty insurer s annual statutory gross written premium should not exceed of its statutory policyholders surplus and net written premium should not exceed of its statutory policyholders surplus 
however  industry standards and rating agency criteria place these ratios at and  respectively 
in the past  our property and casualty insurance companies have maintained premium to surplus ratios generally lower than such guidelines and below industry norms 
for the year ended december   our statutory gross written premium to policyholders surplus was compared to for the year ended december  for the year ended december   our statutory net written premium to policyholders surplus was compared to for the year ended december  the gross written premium ratio increased during with the acquisition of the centris group  inc s book of medical stop loss business and the increasing use of our insurance companies as the issuing company for business written by our underwriting agencies 
this ratio is expected to decrease slowly from its current level as statutory policyholders surplus increases due to the retention of earnings  capital contributions and other increases in policyholders surplus 
as of december   each of our domestic insurance companies total adjusted capital was significantly in excess of the authorized control level risk based capital level prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners 
subsequent to the terrorist attacks on september   where possible  we canceled all terrorist coverage  to the extent we could  under the terms of existing in force policies  primarily in the property and energy lines of business 
all new and renewal policies are written with an appropriate terrorist exclusion except for lines of business  such as aviation  where reinsurance for acts of terrorism is available at an economic cost or where we feel comfortable with the net exposure 
at january   and february   respectively  our onshore energy and property reinsurance protections were renewed without coverage for acts of terrorism 
therefore  to the extent that certain existing  in force policies contain such coverage  then we would have a net exposure to any applicable losses 
the actual amount of this exposure is not determinable but could represent a catastrophic loss  a risk for which we would usually purchase reinsurance protection 
we do not believe that any loss would severely impact our capital 
as each month goes by  existing in force policies will expire and the overall exposure continues to reduce substantially 
impact of inflation our operations  like those of other property and casualty insurers  are susceptible to the effects of inflation  as premiums are established before the ultimate amounts of loss and loss adjustment expense are known 
although we consider the potential effects of inflation when setting premium rates  for competitive reasons  such premiums may not fully offset the effects of inflation 
however  because the majority of our business is comprised of lines which have relatively short lead times between the occurrence of an insured event  reporting of the claims to us and the final settlement of the claims  the effects of inflation are minimized 
a significant portion of our revenue is related to healthcare insurance and reinsurance products that are subject to the effects of the underlying inflation of healthcare costs 
such inflation in the costs of healthcare tends to generate increases in premiums for medical stop loss coverage  resulting in greater revenue  but also higher claim payments 
inflation may have a negative impact on insurance and reinsurance operations by causing higher claim settlements than may originally have been estimated without an immediate increase in premiums to a level necessary to maintain profit margins 
we do not specifically provide for inflation when setting underwriting terms and claim reserves  although we do consider trends 
we continually review claim reserves to assess their adequacy and make necessary adjustments 
also  the market value of our investments vary depending on economic and market conditions and interest rates 
any significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our investments 
in addition  the interest rate payable under our million bank loan fluctuates with that of the market 
any significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our earnings  depending on the amount borrowed on our bank facility 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations we underwrite risks which are denominated in a number of foreign currencies 
as a result  we have receivables and payables in foreign currencies and we establish and maintain loss reserves with respect to our insurance policies in their respective currencies 
our net earnings could be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations affecting these balances 
our principal area of exposure is with respect to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the major european currencies and the us dollar 
we constantly monitor the balance between our receivables and payables and loss reserves to mitigate the potential exposure should an imbalance be expected to exist for other than a short period of time 
for the year ended december   our gain from currency conversion was million compared to a loss of million in and a gain of million in on a limited basis  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts as a hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
rml has revenue streams in us dollars and canadian dollars but incurs expenses in british pound sterling gbp 
to mitigate the foreign exchange risk  we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts expiring at staggered times through december  as of december   we had forward contracts to sell us million for gbp at an average rate of gbp equals us 
the foreign currency forward contracts are used to convert currency at a known rate in an amount which either approximates or is less than average monthly expenses 
thus  the effect of these transactions is to limit the foreign currency exchange risk of the recurring monthly expenses 
we utilize these foreign currency forward contracts strictly as a hedge against existing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations rather than as a form of speculative or trading investment 
the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts december  was immaterial 
significant accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions when applying our accounting policies 
those of our accounting policies that we consider to be most significant and the estimates and assumptions we make in the application of those accounting policies are discussed below 
earned premium and policy acquisition costs all of the property and casualty policies written by our insurance companies qualify as short duration contracts as defined by current accounting literature 
written premium  net of reinsurance  is primarily included in earnings on a pro rata basis over the lives of the related policies 
however  for certain types of business  it is recognized over the period of risk in proportion to the amount of insurance risk provided 
policy acquisition costs  including commissions  taxes  fees and other direct costs of underwriting policies  less ceding commissions allowed by reinsurers  including expense allowances  are deferred and charged or credited to earnings proportionate to the premium earned 
historical and current loss and loss adjustment expense experience and anticipated investment income are considered in determining premium deficiencies and the recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs 
loss and loss adjustment expense loss and loss adjustment expense payable by our insurance companies is based on estimates of payments to be made for reported and incurred but not reported losses and anticipated receipts from salvage and subrogation receipts 
all reserves are recorded on an undiscounted basis  except for an immaterial amount of reserves acquired in a transaction recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
estimates for reported losses are based on all available information  including reports received from ceding companies on assumed business 
estimates for incurred but not reported losses are based both on our experience and the industry s experience 
while we believe that amounts included in our financial statements are adequate  such estimates may be more or less than the amounts ultimately paid when the claims are settled 
we continually review the estimates with our actuaries and any changes are reflected in the period of change 
reinsurance recoverables we constantly review the collectibility of the reinsurance recoverables of our insurance companies and record a reserve for uncollectible reinsurance 
our estimates utilized to calculate the reserve are subject to change and this could affect the level of the reserve required 
management fees and commission income when there is no significant future servicing obligation  management fees and commission income from our underwriting agencies and intermediaries  respectively  are recognized on the revenue recognition date  which is the later of the effective date of policy  the date when the premium can be reasonably established  or the date when substantially all the services relating to the insurance placement have been rendered to the client 
profit commissions based upon the profitability of business written are recorded as revenue at the end of each accounting period based upon the respective formula calculation 
such amounts are adjusted should experience change 
when additional services are required  the service revenue is deferred and recognized over the service period 
we also record an allowance for estimated return commissions which may be required to be paid upon the early termination of policies 
these policies are consistent with policies that have become generally accepted accounting principles for insurance agents and brokers and with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin number entitled revenue recognition in financial statements 
deferred taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on our history of earnings  expectations for future earnings  taxable income in carry back years and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
if there is a material change in the tax laws such that the actual effective tax rate changes or the time periods within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible change  we will need to reevaluate our assumptions which could result in a change in the valuation allowance required 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we assess the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets may not be recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis  we will reduce the carrying value of the asset to estimated fair value  which is most often based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate we determine to be commensurate with the risk 
utilization of different assumptions to project cash flows and changes in interest rates could yield different estimates of discounted cash flow and fair value 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
entitled accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities effective january  the cumulative effect adjustment due to this change in accounting is not material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
since we utilize derivatives or hedging strategies on a limited basis  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to be material on an ongoing basis 
sfas no 
entitled business combinations was issued in june  and became effective july  sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  which requires that acquisitions be recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition 
the pooling of interests method of accounting allowed under prior standards  which reflected business combinations using historical financial information  is now prohibited 
sfas no 
entitled goodwill and other intangible assets was also issued in june   in concert with sfas no 
sfas no 
becomes effective for us on january  sfas no 
requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at a level referred to as a reporting unit  which could be either our reportable segments or one level lower than our reportable segments 
sfas no 
requires us to perform the first goodwill impairment test on all reporting units within six months of adoption 
the first step is to compare the fair value with the book value of a reporting unit 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its book value  the second step will be to calculate the impairment loss  if any 
we will recognize any impairment loss from the initial adoption of sfas no 
as a change in accounting principle 
after the initial adoption  goodwill of a reporting unit will be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or cash flows  but it will impact our results of operations 
based upon our preliminary review of the impact of sfas no 
to determine the effect  if any  of the initial goodwill impairment testing  we do not believe that we will have to record an impairment charge 
however  we are still in the process of completing the valuations  so our tentative conclusion could change 
sfas no 
also requires the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill effective january  and that goodwill recognized for acquisition which were consummated after july  not be amortized 
amortization of goodwill charged to operations  net of tax effect  in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
we did not amortize the goodwill related to our acquisitions consummated in october  sfas no 
entitled accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets was issued in august  and will become effective for us on january  sfas no 
resolves implementation issues being experienced under previously existing accounting literature but does not change previous requirements to a recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount for an asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows  and b measure the impairment loss as the difference between carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
sfas no 
also retains the basic provisions of discontinued operations found in previous accounting literature but broadens the separate income statement presentation of discontinued operations from a reporting segment to a component of the entity which has clearly distinguishable operations and cash flows 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
euro conversion on january   certain member countries of the european union irrevocably fixed the conversion rates between their national currencies and a common currency  the euro  which became the common legal currency of those countries on that date 
the participating countries former national currencies continued to serve as legal tender and as denominations of the euro until january  the conversion to the euro is scheduled to be completed on july   when the national currencies will cease to exist 
the introduction of the euro has not had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our principal assets and liabilities are financial instruments which are subject to the market risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk on fixed income securities and interest expense on variable rate debt  equity risk on marketable equity securities  credit risk on reinsurance recoverables and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
to manage the exposures of our investment risks  we generally invest in investment grade securities with characteristics of duration and liquidity to reflect the underlying characteristics of the insurance liabilities of our insurance companies 
we have not historically used derivatives to manage any of our investment related market risks 
caution should be used in evaluating overall market risk from the information below 
actual results could differ materially from estimates below for a variety of reasons  including  among other things amounts and balances on which the estimates are based are likely to change over time  assumptions used in the models may prove to be inaccurate  market changes could be different from market changes assumed below  and not all factors and balances are taken into account 
interest rate risk the value of our portfolio of fixed income securities is inversely correlated to changes in the market interest rates 
in addition  some of our fixed income securities have call or prepayment options 
this could subject us to reinvestment risk should interest rates fall or issuers call their securities and we reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by investing in securities with varied maturity dates  so that only a portion of the portfolio will mature at any point in time 
the fair value of our fixed income securities as of december  was million and was million as of december  if market interest rates were to change  eg from to the fair value of our fixed income securities would change approximately million as of december  this compares to change in value of million as of december  for the same change in market interest rates 
the change in fair value was determined using duration modeling assuming no prepayments 
our million bank loan is subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense on this loan is directly correlated to market interest rates 
as of december   we had million in debt outstanding under the bank loan 
at that debt level  the change in market interest rates eg from to would have changed interest expense by million 
as of december   there was no balance outstanding under our bank loan and our convertible notes are not subject to interest rate changes 
equity risk our portfolio of marketable equity securities is subject to equity price risk due to market changes 
the fair value of our marketable equity securities as of december  was million  compared to million as of december  the balance at december  includes mutual fund securities with a value of million 
these mutual funds are invested heavily in fixed income securities but represent marketable equity securities for reporting purposes 
if the market price of all marketable equity securities were to change by as of these dates  the fair value of our equity portfolio would have changed million as of december  and million as of december  foreign exchange risk the table below shows the net amounts of significant foreign currency balances at december  and converted to us dollars 
it also shows the expected dollar change in fair value that would occur if exchange rates changed from exchange rates in effect at those times in thousands hypothetical hypothetical us dollar change in us dollar change in equivalent fair value equivalent fair value british pound sterling   canadian dollar  euro and national currencies  cape verde escudo  see foreign exchange rate fluctuations section contained in item  management s discussion and notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information
