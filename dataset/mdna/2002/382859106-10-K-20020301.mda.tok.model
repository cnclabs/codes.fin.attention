item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial information and the consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements  such as statements of expected revenues and expenses  that involve risks and uncertainties 
we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those detailed from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission and those discussed in this form k  particularly in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and under factors that may affect future results 
unless expressly stated or the content otherwise requires  the terms we  our  us  the company and gric refer to gric communications  inc and its subsidiaries as a whole 
overview we provide services and software that enable our customers to offer internet based mobile office communications services  such as internet roaming  to their end users worldwide 
our customers include telecommunications companies  internet service providers  corporate enterprises and newly emerging communications service providers 
from our incorporation in until we were both an internet service provider in northern california and an independent software developer for the internet service provider community 
in  we sold our local internet service provider business 
we first recognized settlement revenues in  and since we have derived our revenues primarily from settlement and clearinghouse services for our customers  who are members of the gric alliance 
from late until january  we also provided internet telephony settlement services  which were characterized by high revenues that generated low margins 
on january   we announced that we were ceasing to provide internet telephony service in order to focus on internet roaming services  based on an analysis of operating expenses and gross margins  and our expectation that continued internet telephony operations would require additional cash infusions 
in connection with that new focus  we also restructured our operations by reducing our workforce  eliminating bandwidth costs associated with internet telephony  and reducing our equipment and network maintenance expenses 
as a result of this restructuring we are now focused on providing internet based mobile office communications services globally 
as an internet based mobile office communications services business  we generate settlement revenues when we provide settlement services to customers whose end users initiate internet communications 
for these transactions  our settlement services consist of tracking usage globally  collecting the amount that a roamer s home service provider owes us  paying the appropriate amount to the service provider enabling local access  and providing the underlying usage data to our customer to enable end user billing 
we have incurred substantial losses since our inception as a result of expenses associated with building the gric alliance and related network infrastructure and developing our software products 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future  and we cannot assure you that we will achieve or sustain profitability 
see factors that may affect future results we have not been profitable to date and we anticipate continued losses during our business model has evolved in the course of our development and we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance 
our future prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
see factors that may affect future results our operating history is more limited than that of many other companies  so you may find it difficult to evaluate our business in making an investment decision 
critical accounting policies and estimates the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and related allowances 
we derive revenues primarily from settlement services we provide to customers through our network 
we record estimated allowances against settlement revenues in the same period the revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based upon historical analysis of our credit memo data and other known factors for pricing and transaction volume disputes that arise in the normal course of business 
to date  allowances for disputed amounts have not been significant 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not accurately reflect amounts associated with future disputes  our actual revenues could be higher or lower than what we have recognized 
we also derive revenues from licenses of software to customers seeking to offer internet roaming and internet telephony services to their end users  and from sales of maintenance and support services 
estimates and judgments we make regarding recognition of these revenues are not likely to have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from our customers inability to make payments they owe us 
in order to estimate the appropriate level of this allowance  we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  current customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and to impair their ability to make payments to us  additional allowances might be required in future periods 
results of operations compared to revenues total revenues consist of settlement revenues and software and other revenues 
total revenues decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease of 
settlement revenues 
settlement revenues consist of revenues from internet telephone services through january  before we ceased providing those services  and revenues from internet roaming services 
settlement revenues decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease of 
the decrease represents a million decrease in internet telephony settlement services  partially offset by a million increase in internet roaming settlement services due to expansion of our internet roaming customer base and increased volumes of internet roaming by our existing customers 
we expect settlement revenues to increase in and to exceed total revenues 
software and other revenues 
software and other revenues consist of revenue from sales of software licenses  maintenance and services 
software  maintenance and service revenues decreased to  in from million in  a decrease of 
the decrease is primarily due to lower sales of licenses of certain components of our clearinghouse software and related maintenance and services  partially offset by higher revenues from sales of internet roaming software  maintenance and services 
we expect software and other revenues to constitute an insignificant component of total revenues for costs and expenses cost of settlement revenues 
cost of settlement revenues consists of amounts we pay to access the internet in order to provide internet roaming services for our customers and amounts we paid to terminate internet telephony services for our customers through january before we ceased providing those services 
cost of settlement revenues decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease of 
the decrease represents a million decrease in internet telephony settlement costs partially offset by a million increase in internet roaming costs due to increased volumes of internet roaming minutes 
internet roaming costs decreased as a percentage of internet roaming revenue in primarily due to lower rates obtained from our providers 
we expect that for the cost of settlement revenues will increase in absolute dollars as roaming revenue increases  but will decline as a percentage of total settlement revenues as a result of our ceasing to provide internet telephony service and our expectation to lower rates with our internet roaming providers 
cost of software and other revenues 
cost of software  hardware and maintenance services revenues represents the cost of equipment  software and professional services associated with this revenue 
cost of software  hardware and maintenance and services revenues decreased to zero in from  in network and operations 
network and operations expenses consist of salaries and benefits  depreciation on network equipment  allocated facility and management information systems expenses  costs of co location of network equipment and leased telecommunication lines and other related costs 
network and operations expenses decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease of 
the decrease was primarily due to elimination of co location and telecommunication costs as we ceased to provide internet telephony services 
this decrease was partially offset by an overall increase in staffing and related expenses to provide customer support and to operate our network centers on a hours a day  seven days a week basis 
we expect the aggregate amount of network and operations expenses to decrease during research and development 
research and development expenses consist of salaries and benefits  outside consultants  recruiting costs of employees  quality assurance  allocated facility  management information systems and depreciation costs and other related costs 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease of 
the decrease was primarily due to engineering personnel reductions following our january restructuring as we focused principally on continued development of our core internet roaming software 
we also reduced costs by expanding the use of our development center in india  where engineering talent may be obtained at more favorable rates than in the san francisco bay area 
we expect the aggregate amount of research and development expenses to continue to decrease during sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries and benefits  commissions earned by sales and marketing personnel  allocated facility  management information systems and depreciation costs  costs for marketing and promotional programs  and costs associated with domestic and international sales offices and other related costs 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in  representing an increase of 
the increase reflects our investment in marketing campaigns and professional services to promote our corporate image and brand identity 
we expect the aggregate amount of sales and marketing expenses to decrease during general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of general corporate and facility costs as well as salary  benefits and related costs for executive  finance  legal  administrative  human resources  investor relations and management information systems functions and provisions for uncollectible receivables 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  representing an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to the write off of all uncollected internet telephony receivables in we expect the aggregate amount of general and administrative expenses to decrease during amortization of stock based compensation 
some stock options previously granted through december  are considered compensatory because the estimated fair value for accounting purposes was greater than the stock option exercise price as determined by the board of directors on the date of grant 
as a result  we have recorded related amortization of deferred compensation expense of  in and as of december   we had an aggregate of  of deferred compensation remaining to be amortized 
deferred compensation is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the options 
we expect amortization of approximately  in and  in restructuring charge 
in connection with our january restructuring we incurred a total charge to operations of million 
restructuring related involuntary employee severance costs resulted in a charge of  pertaining to the expected termination of employees worldwide 
all worldwide employees who were involved in providing  selling or supporting internet telephony services or who performed related functions were considered during the cost cutting plan 
a total of employees were terminated as part of these cost cutting measures 
the termination of lease and facility obligation resulted in a charge of million 
we considered the costs of terminating these commitments to be related to our decision to cease providing internet telephony services 
the net book value of fixed assets retired as part of our restructuring totaled million 
the assets consisted primarily of computer hardware and software previously utilized in our internet telephony business 
during  we sold assets held for sale totaling  for a gain of  at december    representing the remaining recoverable amount of these assets held for sale is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
employee severance costs termination of lease and facility obligations retirement of fixed assets total in thousands q provision    non cash charges   cash payments   accruals at december  interest income and other  net interest income and other  net  represents interest income on cash balances and on short term investments 
interest income and other  net  decreased to  in from million in the decrease was primarily due to the higher cash balances in resulting from our initial public offering in december and subsequent reductions for cash used in operations 
interest expense interest expense consists of interest expense associated with capital leases and amortization of the fair value of warrants issued in connection with our financing activities 
interest expense decreased to  in from  in the decrease was primarily due to the payment of outstanding capital lease obligations 
income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased to  in from  in the provision for income taxes consists of foreign taxes 
sfas statement no 
provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of these assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance and reported cumulative net losses in all prior years  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
we intend to evaluate the ability to realize the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal purposes of approximately million which expire in years through we also have net operating loss carryforwards for state purposes of approximately million which expire in years through we have federal and state research and development tax credits of approximately  which expire in years through and approximately  which carry forward indefinitely 
utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
such an ownership change could occur as a result of future financing activities as well as secondary trading in our securities 
the annual limitation might result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
compared to revenues total revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the primary reason for the growth was increased settlement revenues 
settlement revenues 
settlement revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase primarily reflects higher volumes of both internet telephony and internet roaming minutes 
as a result of our january restructuring  we have ceased providing internet telephony settlement services 
software and other revenues 
software  hardware and maintenance and services revenues decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of 
the decrease was primarily due to lower sales of our prepaid internet telephony software services and discontinued sales of internet telephony hardware  offset by higher sales to license certain components of our internet roaming clearinghouse software 
costs and expenses cost of settlement revenues 
cost of settlement revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase was due to higher sales volumes of our internet telephony services as well as the higher proportion of our total services revenue mix that these lower margin services represented 
cost of software and other revenues 
cost of software  hardware and maintenance and services revenues decreased to  in from  in  a decrease of 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the discontinued sales of hardware and lower maintenance and services costs for internet telephony services 
network and operations 
network and operations expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
this increase was due to higher levels of business activity and higher costs associated with the expansion of our customer support and network operation centers 
research and development 
research and development increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to the costs of engineers engaged in the continued development of our proprietary settlement software and internet roaming software 
to date  all software development costs have been expensed in the period incurred 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase reflects the hiring and recruitment of additional personnel to expand our geographic coverage and to support the growth of our global internet roaming and telephony services 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase reflects the hiring of additional personnel and consultants to provide the infrastructure to support future growth  as well as increases in professional services fees 
amortization of stock based compensation 
we have recorded expenses of  in and  in relating to the amortization of deferred compensation expense 
interest income and other  net interest income and other  net increased to million in from  in this increase was due to higher average cash and investment balances during the year as a result of the company s initial public offering in december interest expense interest expense decreased to  in from million in the decrease was primarily due to no additional warrants being offered in  as well as the conversion of bridge loans to preferred stock in the second quarter of income taxes the provision for income taxes increased to  in from  in liquidity and capital resources in thousands cash and cash equivalents    net cash used in operating activities    net cash used in provided by investing activities   net cash used in provided by financing activities   cash and cash equivalents 
our principal source of liquidity is our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
as of december   in addition to our cash and cash equivalents balance of million  we had a short term investment balance of approximately million 
operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in and million in net cash used in operating activities in  and was primarily a result of net operating losses and our january strategic restructuring charges 
investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in and net cash used in investing activities was million in and million in the net cash provided by investing activities in was primarily the result of proceeds from maturing short term investments to fund net operating activities 
the cash used in investing activities in and was primarily a result of purchases of short term investments that utilized the funds received from the company s initial public offering 
other uses of cash in investing activities consisted of purchases of computer hardware  relating to the network infrastructure  and of computer hardware and software for our increasing employee base 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was  in and net cash provided by financing activities was million in and million in net cash used in financing activities in primarily consisted of payment of debt and treasury stock 
net cash provided by financing activities in primarily consisted of proceeds from sales of common stock through incentive stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
in  we completed our initial public offering  which raised million net of costs 
commitments 
we lease all of our facilities under operating leases that expire at various dates through as of december   we had million in future operating lease commitments and  of capital lease obligations and equipment promissory notes 
approximately million in future operating lease commitments and all of the capital lease obligations are payable during in the future we do not expect to continue to finance the acquisition of computer and network equipment through additional capital lease arrangements 
stock repurchase program 
in september  the board of directors approved a program to expend up to  to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market transactions 
as of december   we purchased  shares for approximately  we have not repurchased any of our shares since late october summary of liquidity 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented on a going concern basis 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december  our january restructuring plan enabled us to reduce our operating expenses in however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining operating expenses at the levels experienced in the quarterly period ended december  or reducing operating expenses in the future 
establishing profitable operations is our ultimate goal  however  we expect to incur losses and negative cash flow from operations in our operating plans call for operations to consume fewer funds in than in because of our plan to increase revenue and related margins in  while holding other operating expenses at levels that approximate the annualized run rate of the fourth quarter of while a forecast of future events is inherently uncertain  we believe that the combination of total available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december   will provide sufficient funding for our planned operations through at least december  given the funding requirements in our operating plan 
we plan to invest in expanding our internet roaming and related services on a global basis 
this will require us to maintain continued favorable market acceptance and growth of our internet roaming and related services offerings in order for us to continue our research and development activities and fund planned operating expenses 
there can be no assurance that our internet roaming product offerings will maintain favorable market acceptance  growth and operating margins 
if we are unable to attain our revenue and margin goals  significant reductions in spending and the delay or cancellation of planned activities or more substantial restructuring may be necessary to enable us to meet our cash requirements through december  these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and prospects 
furthermore  we may need to raise additional funds in future periods through public or private financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements to fund operations and potential acquisitions  if any 
we may never achieve profitability 
any additional financing  if needed  might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
failure to raise capital when needed could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
if additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of ownership of our stockholders would be reduced 
furthermore  these equity securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock 
on january   we entered into a series a preferred stock and warrant purchase agreement with h q asia pacific growth fund iii  lp  vertex technology fund ii ltd and vertex technology fund iii ltd 
under the terms of this agreement  we intend to issue and sell  through a private placement  up to million of a newly created series a preferred stock to these investors  subject to approval of the private placement by our stockholders 
we will seek stockholder approval of this transaction 
additional details concerning this proposed financing will be provided in our definitive proxy statement to be filed with the securities and exchange commission 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective january  sfas supercedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting reporting provisions relating to the disposal of a segment of a business of accounting principles board opinion no we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
factors that may affect future results in addition to the information in this annual report on form k  the following should be considered in evaluating gric and our business 
we have not been profitable to date and we anticipate continued losses during to date  we have not been profitable 
we cannot assure you that we will ever achieve or sustain profitability 
we reported operating losses before income taxes of million for  million for  and million for as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we have also experienced negative cash flows in each year since our inception in we expect to incur operating losses during in particular  we expect to continue to invest in research and development and sales and marketing  and we expect to face pressure to adopt new pricing arrangements  including volume discounts  that may lower our gross margins 
if revenues do not meet levels we anticipate  or if our costs and expenses exceed our expectations  we will continue to sustain losses  and our business and the price of our common stock may be harmed 
our operating history is more limited than that of many other companies  so you may find it difficult to evaluate our business in making an investment decision 
we have limited experience providing clearinghouse services having done so since only and it is only since january that our efforts have been focused primarily on providing services that enable our customers to provide internet roaming services to their end users 
many members of our senior management team and other employees have worked with us for only a short period of time 
consequently  we have not demonstrated that our business can succeed 
we may require additional capital for our operations  which could have a negative effect on your investment 
if we do not close our proposed sale of series a preferred stock  or the funds we raise in that sale prove to be insufficient  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds in the future in order to fund operations or acquisitions 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  our stockholders may experience additional dilution and these new securities may have powers  preferences and rights that are senior to those of the rights of our common stock 
for example  in the proposed sale of our series a preferred stock  the investors would control a significant portion of our outstanding capital stock  and the owners of the series a preferred stock will have claims that are senior to those of holders of the common stock in the event of a bankruptcy or liquidation  and the issuance of the series a preferred stock will substantially dilute your ownership interest 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to fund our business operations  promote our brand identity  take advantage of acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance services or respond to competitive pressures 
any inability to do so could have a negative effect on our business  revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
in  we restructured our business  which makes us primarily dependent on the success of our internet roaming service 
in january  we restructured our business by ceasing to provide internet telephony service and focusing on our internet roaming service 
this concentration makes us more dependent on the growth of the internet roaming market in general  and will increase the negative impact on our business if our internet roaming product offerings do not maintain favorable market acceptance and growth or achieve our revenue and margin targets 
we face significant competition  including competition from larger companies  which could make it more difficult for us to succeed 
our business environment is intensely competitive  highly fragmented and rapidly changing 
competition can come from many sources 
for example  we compete directly with ipass in the market for internet roaming and related settlement services  and ipass has a network that competes with the gric alliance 
large communications service providers such as equant  at t and worldcom uunet also have the ability and resources to compete with us in the internet based mobile office communications services market 
we could also face competition from emerging  wireless based network service providers targeting the traveling business communities 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources  larger customer bases  longer operating histories  greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we have 
any of these competitors may combine or form strategic partnerships  gaining competitive advantages as a result 
our competitors may be able to develop and market products and services that are superior to our own in terms of features  quality  pricing or other factors 
our success depends on our ability to maintain and increase our customer base 
customers are generally free to use competing products and services  so we could face significant customer losses  which could occur at unpredictable times 
our customers are generally not obligated to generate minimum revenues  and some generate very little revenue for us 
these factors make it difficult to anticipate the level of our future revenues from existing customers 
in addition  our success depends on our ability to expand our customer base 
if we lose any significant customer or are unable to expand our customer base and to increase our average revenues per customer  our business will be harmed 
if we fail to attract larger customers  our revenues could fail to increase 
historically  a significant portion of our revenues has been derived from smaller companies in the internet marketplace  but in recent periods we have attempted to focus our sales and marketing efforts on larger corporate and enterprise level customers 
this strategy places new demands on our business  such as the longer sales cycles and higher levels of service and support that larger accounts generally require 
if we fail in this strategy  or if we have underestimated the costs of this strategy  our results of operations would be likely to be harmed 
we depend on our customers to market internet based communications services to their end users  so our revenues depend on the activities of others and on the market acceptance of their services 
our business depends on the efforts and success of our customers in marketing internet based communications services to their end users 
we have little ability to promote our services  or to promote demand for our customers services generally 
if our customers fail to market their internet based communications services effectively  our revenues will be reduced 
similarly  if the market for internet based communications services fails to grow  or expands more slowly than anticipated  our revenues will be lower than expected 
the internet based services we provide are relatively new and have not achieved widespread market acceptance 
network service providers and communication solutions providers may be reluctant to promote or rely upon our services until they gain greater commercial acceptance  which may never occur 
sales in the internet infrastructure market are subject to fluctuation 
although sales to the internet infrastructure market have grown historically  this market is characterized by sporadic purchasing decisions 
in addition  many companies have warned of lower than expected revenue and declines or delays in sales orders from companies in the internet infrastructure market 
sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures  the availability of funding  and the extent that service providers are affected by local regulatory and business conditions 
lower sales in the internet infrastructure market could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we are unable to manage growth  the gric alliance and our product development efforts effectively  our business will be harmed 
in the past  rapid growth strained our network operations resources  product development resources and other managerial  operating and financial resources 
we expect these strains to resume if we resume our growth  and our financial performance and our ability to compete effectively will depend  in part  on our ability to manage any future growth effectively 
if we are not able to manage research and development efforts  network infrastructure  performance and internal controls effectively  our costs will be higher than expected and our business will be harmed 
our operating results fluctuate and are difficult to predict  so we may fail to satisfy the expectations of investors or market analysts and our stock price may decline 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past  and we expect them to fluctuate in the future 
despite our january restructuring  our business may fail to grow rapidly enough to offset operating expenses 
the primary factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  many of which are beyond our control  include changes in global travel patterns due to past and potential future terrorist activities in the us and the military responses to them in southern asia and elsewhere  economic conditions generally  and slowdowns in the specific industries in which our customers operate  the volume of transaction based revenues  the timing of deployment of services by our customers  competitive pricing pressure  the mix of services used by our customers end users  our ability to collect accounts receivable  particularly for customers based outside the us  the domestic and international regulatory environment  and unanticipated increases in operating and marketing expenses 
business models relying on the internet to provide communications services are still evolving 
as a result  you should not rely on the results of any past periods as an indication of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future periods  our operating results may be below expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock is likely to decline 
our customers require a high degree of reliability in the delivery of our services  and if we cannot meet their expectations for any reason  demand for our products and services will suffer 
our success depends in large part on our ability to assure generally error free clearinghouse services  uninterrupted operation of our network and software infrastructure  and a satisfactory experience for our customers end users 
to achieve these objectives  we depend on the quality  performance and scalability of our products and services  the responsiveness of our technical support and the capacity  reliability and security of our network operations 
we also depend on third parties over which we have no control 
for example  our ability to serve approximately countries is based solely on our network access agreement with one service provider and on that service provider s ability to provide reliable internet access points in those countries 
in the past  we have experienced problems due to our inability to detect system malfunctions and due to errors in collecting or processing account usage and settlement data 
due to the high level of performance required for critical communications traffic  any failure to deliver a satisfactory experience to end users  whether or not caused by our own failures  and any failure to provide accurate settlement data in connection with acting as a clearinghouse  could reduce demand for our products and services 
as a clearinghouse  we have greater collection risks than many other companies 
difficulties in collecting accounts receivable will harm our financial results  and this collection risk is inherently greater for us as a clearinghouse service provider because we are obligated to pay amounts owed to each customer whether or not we have collected all the amounts due to us from other customers 
in addition  if end users or unauthorized third parties engage in unauthorized or otherwise fraudulent roaming activity  we may face difficulty collecting the resulting accounts receivable 
if we are not able to manage this problem  our financial results will suffer 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new services  we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we have generated substantially all of our revenue from the sale of remote internet access 
in order to realize our potential  we will need to continue to enhance our existing services and to develop and introduce new and complementary services 
if we do not succeed in introducing  marketing and managing the installation and implementation of new services and distribution channels in a timely manner  our competitive position could be harmed 
even if we succeed in developing and establishing new services  we do not know if they will achieve market acceptance or support adequate pricing levels or generate revenues sufficient for us to become profitable 
further  we do not know whether third party developers of internet communications applications will be willing to develop new applications that can be delivered as part of our mobile office communications solutions  or that we will be able to develop any applications of this type ourselves 
our long sales cycle makes it particularly difficult for us to forecast revenues  requires us to incur high sales costs  and aggravates fluctuations in quarterly financial results 
our business is characterized by a long sales cycle between the time a potential customer is contacted and the time a new customer relationship is established 
in addition  after the new customer relationship is established there may be further significant delays before new users are brought into our system and we begin to realize associated revenues 
as a result  we typically incur substantial sales costs before we recognize any related revenues  this may increase the volatility of our results because we may have high costs without associated offsetting revenues 
recently  our revenues have been adversely affected by the general economic downturn 
if the costs associated with the long sales cycle increase  or if we are unable to generate associated offsetting revenues  our operating results will be harmed 
because much of our business is conducted internationally  we encounter special difficulties  which may impede our progress toward profitability and harm the price of our common stock 
because we generate most of our revenues from business conducted internationally  we are subject to special risks 
it is costly to maintain international facilities and operations  promote our brand internationally and develop localized systems and support centers 
revenues from certain regions may not offset the expense of maintaining operations in these regions 
additional risks faced by our international operations include key members of the senior management of our foreign operations have only recently joined our company  longer payment cycles for foreign customers  including delays due to currency controls and fluctuations  reductions in business activity generally in certain global locations  that could negatively impact overall revenue growth  negative impacts of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  potentially high taxes in foreign countries  difficulties complying with a variety of foreign laws  trade standards and tariffs and of overcoming trade barriers  and difficulties complying with telecommunications and other internet related regulations in many foreign jurisdictions 
we are also exposed to general geopolitical risks  such as political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
any of these factors could negatively impact our business by reducing our profitability and harm the price of our common stock 
we need to hire and retain qualified personnel to sustain the growth of our business  which is particularly difficult for us because we compete with other companies in the san francisco bay area where we are based 
our future success depends  in part  on the continued service of our key executive  management and technical personnel  and our ability to attract new skilled employees 
from time to time we have experienced difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees  and we expect to continue to experience this sort of difficulty 
declines in the market price of our common stock could also hurt employee morale and retention 
if we are not able to retain our key employees or to attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future  our business could be harmed because our growth might be slowed or executive leadership might be disrupted 
it is difficult to hire and retain qualified sales personnel 
highly trained sales personnel are key to our performance 
competition for these individuals is intense  and we may not be able to hire the type and number of sales personnel we need 
moreover  even after we hire salespersons  they require extensive training in our products and services 
if we are unable to continue to retain our current employees and train new sales personnel as rapidly as necessary  we may not be able to increase market awareness and sales of our services  which may prevent us from generating revenue and achieving and maintaining profitability 
litigation arising out of intellectual property infringement or other commercial disputes could be expensive and disrupt our business 
we cannot be certain that our products or services do not  or will not  infringe upon patents  trademarks  copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by third parties 
in addition  since we rely on third parties to help us develop  market and support our product and service offerings  we cannot assure you that litigation will not arise from disputes involving those third parties 
from time to time we have been  and we expect to continue to be  party to disputes with these third parties 
we may incur substantial expenses in defending against these claims  regardless of their merit 
successful claims against us may result in substantial monetary liability  significantly impact our results of operations in one or more quarters or materially disrupt the conduct of our business 
our executive officers and directors hold a significant percentage of our stock and may be able to control matters requiring stockholder approval 
as of december   our executive officers and directors  and their affiliated entities  owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
accordingly  these stockholders may have a substantial influence on all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company 
our charter documents and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a takeover and depress our stock price 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  despite the possible benefit to our stockholders  and this may potentially lower the price of our common stock 
these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws authorize the board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors  limit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for the election of the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
in addition  we have elected to remain subject to the anti takeover provisions of delaware law 
these factors may discourage takeover attempts 
if our common stock price falls below and remains under  or if we otherwise fail to comply with nasdaq rules  our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq national market  which could severely limit the trading market for our common stock 
if we fail to meet the criteria for continued listing on the nasdaq national market  our common stock may be delisted  which could make it more difficult for you to sell your shares 
for example  if the market price for our common stock falls and remains below per share for thirty trading days  we would be subject to delisting

future developments in internet based communications services  which are critical to our success  are uncertain 
for us to increase our revenues  the internet must be validated as an effective medium for the delivery of internet roaming and other internet based communications services 
the infrastructure of the public internet may not be able to support increased demands placed on it  and the performance of the internet may be adversely affected 
our business will be harmed if the internet does not continue to grow as a telecommunications medium  and that growth may be inhibited by factors such as unreliability of the internet infrastructure  emergence of competing technologies and communications paradigms  security concerns  new regulatory requirements  inconsistent quality of service  and lack of availability of cost effective service 
security concerns may deter the use of the internet for internet based communications  which would reduce demand for our products and services 
the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks is a significant barrier to widespread adoption of electronic commerce and communications 
the internet is a public network and information is sent over this network from many sources 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of code breaking or other developments could result in compromised security on our network or the networks of others 
security and authentication concerns with respect to the transmission over the internet of confidential information  such as corporate access passwords  and the ability of unauthorized computer users  so called hackers  to penetrate online security systems may reduce the demand for our services 
if any well publicized compromises of confidential information were to occur  it could reduce demand for internet based communications and our products and services 
government regulations and legal uncertainties regarding the internet could harm our business 
at present  internet based communication services are not subject to fees that the us federal communications commission generally imposes on entities that use the local telephone network to access customers 
internet based communication services also are generally not subject to other federal fees or taxes imposed to support programs such as universal telephone service 
changes in the rules or regulations of the us federal communications commission or in applicable federal communications laws to impose such fees or taxes could add significant new costs to our operations  and we are not certain how those increased costs could affect demand for our services 
any new law or regulation pertaining to internet based communication services  or the application or interpretation of existing laws  could decrease the demand for our services  increase our cost of doing business or otherwise harm our business 
there is  and will likely continue to be  an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet 
these laws or regulations may relate to taxation and the quality of products and services 
furthermore  the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing intellectual property ownership and infringement  copyright  trademark  trade secret  obscenity  libel  employment  personal privacy and other issues is uncertain and developing 
in addition  we are not certain how our business may be affected by the application of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyrights  encryption and other intellectual property issues  taxation  and export or import matters 
the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet 
as a result  they may not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
changes in laws intended to address these issues could create uncertainty in the internet market 
these uncertainties could reduce demand for our services or increase the cost of doing business through litigation costs or increased service delivery costs

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks foreign currency risk 
we have limited exposure to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
although we have foreign operations in europe and asia  to date  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations has not been significant 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio and debt obligations 
interest rate risk occurs when we cannot hold a purchased investment to its maturity 
the weighted average maturity of our investment portfolio  when taking into account the reset feature of floating rate municipal bonds  is limited to days 
we intend to hold our securities until maturity and  therefore  do not expect to recognize an adverse impact on income or cash flows  although there can be no assurance of this 
we have established policies and business practices regarding our investment portfolio to preserve principal while obtaining reasonable rates of return without significantly increasing risk 
we place investments with high credit quality issuers according to our investment policy 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
all investments are carried at fair market value for due to the short term nature of our investments and the immaterial amount of our debt obligation  we believe that there is no material exposure to interest fluctuation 
therefore  no accompanying table has been provided
