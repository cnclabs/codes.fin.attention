as a result of this treatment  the company  as the successor to prep fund  recorded all of the assets and liabilities of prep fund at their book value  but was required to record the assets of prep fund and pension fund at their fair value 
the amount by which the fair value of the company s stock issued to the buc holders of prep fund and pension fund exceeded the fair value of the net assets of prep fund and pension fund was recorded as goodwill by the company

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general america first mortgage investments  inc was incorporated in maryland on july  the company began operations on april  when it merged with the prep funds 
concurrent with the merger  the company entered into the advisory agreement with the advisor and adopted an investment policy that significantly differed from that pursued by the prep funds 
prior to the advisor merger  the advisor provided advisory services to the company in connection with the conduct of the company s business activities and operations 
the company s principal investment strategy provides for leveraged investing in adjustable rate and hybrid mbs 
in addition  the company s investment strategy also provides for the acquisition of multifamily housing properties  reit securities and high yield corporate securities 
the company has elected to be subject to tax as a reit for federal income tax purposes beginning with its taxable year and  as such  the company has distributed  and anticipates in the future distributing  on an annual basis at least prior to january  of its annual taxable net income to its stockholders  subject to certain adjustments 
generally  cash for such distributions is expected to be largely generated from the company s operations  although the company may borrow funds to make distributions 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and supplementary data and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
advisor merger from the time of the merger through december   the company was externally managed by the advisor 
the company had no employees of its own as an externally managed reit and relied on the advisor to conduct its business operations 
as such  the primary components of the company s general and administrative expenses were the base advisory and incentive compensation fees paid to the advisor 
due to the increase in the company s assets and stockholders equity during  the company s board of directors determined that it was in the best interest of the company that it should become a self advised reit 
accordingly  on september   the company entered into the advisor merger agreement pursuant to which the advisor was to be merged with and into the company 
in december  the company s stockholders approved the terms of the advisor merger agreement  which provided for the merger of the advisor into the company effective am on january  as a result  the company became self advised and commencing january  and thereafter will directly incur the cost of all overhead expenses necessary to operate the company and will no longer have any obligation to pay fees to the advisor 
as a result of the advisor merger  the employees of the advisor became employees of the company 
management of the company believes that  under current market conditions  the additional costs incurred in operating the company on a self advised basis will be less than the amount of the fees that would have otherwise been payable to the advisor had the company remained an externally advised reit 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will incur lower expenses as a self advised reit 
in connection with the advisor merger agreement  the company issued  shares of its common stock to the stockholders of the advisor 
these shares represented approximately of the total outstanding shares of common stock immediately following the advisor merger 
as a result  earnings per share on the company s common stock could decrease as a result of the advisor merger  even though the company s costs decline as a result of becoming self advised 
for accounting purposes  the advisor merger is not considered the acquisition of a business for purposes of applying accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 business combinations and  therefore  the market value of the common stock issued  valued as of the consummation of the advisor merger  in excess of the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired was charged to operating income rather than capitalized as goodwill for the year ended december results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  in comparing the results of operations for with  the results are marked by two significant charges and a substantial growth in assets funded by leveraging of the additional equity capital raised during the year 
specifically  the company incurred an expense of approximately million  of which approximately million was non cash  as a one time cost in connection with the advisor merger 
in addition  the company incurred a charge of approximately million taken against the corporate debt securities portfolio for an other than temporary impairment against an investment in corporate debt securities 
total interest and dividend income increased by approximately million  or  to approximately million compared to approximately million earned in the increase is directly attributable to the growth in assets as a result of the investing  on a leveraged basis  the proceeds from the sale of approximately million shares of the company s common stock 
the company s core assets which consist of mbs  generated approximately million of income  reflecting approximately million  or  increase from approximately million for the increase in mbs income reflects the growth in the company s mbs portfolio of approximately billion  or  from approximately million as of december  to billion as of december  lifetime interest rate caps on adjustable rate mbs could limit earnings on the company s assets 
at december   approximately of the company s adjustable rate mbs of the total assets had a periodic generally one year cap annual limit for rate changes on the underlying mortgages with the remainder having a annual cap 
management believes that the impact of periodic caps on the operating results for  if any  would be slight  given that the weighted average coupon on these assets was at december   basis points greater than the one year cmt 
income recognized on short term investments in cash and cash equivalents increased by  as funds generated through the sale of the company s common shares remain in interest earning cash investments until fully invested 
further  significant growth in investments will  in general  due to the reinvestment lag  result in an increase in temporary cash investments 
income from corporate debt securities increased  however losses on sales of such securities and losses recognized for other than temporary impairment on one of the company s corporate debt investments far exceeded the growth in income 
slightly offsetting increases in interest income was a decrease in dividend income on equity securities of  reflecting sales of equity securities 
the yield on the equity security portfolio decreased to for from in the company s interest expense increased by approximately million  or  for the year ended december  the average borrowings under repurchase agreements increased by approximately million  or from approximately million during to approximately million during  while the average cost of borrowings decreased from to for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net interest and dividend income increased by approximately million  or  from approximately million to approximately million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s net interest margin improved by basis points to for from for overall  the significant increase in the company s net interest income can be attributed to the significant balance sheet growth and the increase in the interest rate spread and net interest margin during during  interest rates generally declined  resulting in an expansion ie  increase in interest rate spreads and margins 
should interest rates increase  as management expects to occur during  the company s interest rate spread and net interest margin would compress ie  decline  the amount and timing of such compression will be driven by  among other factors  the interest rate environment and thus cannot be predicted with any uncertainty 
income and gains from other investments decreased approximately million  to million for  from million for this decrease reflects a decline in the performance and resulting net operating income available for distribution to the company on its real estate investments 
as of december   the company had indirect interests in six multi family properties consisting of a total of  rental units  through investments in four limited partnerships and one corporation as a preferred stockholder 
these investments  which had a net carrying value of  at december   comprised less than of the company s total assets 
during both and  the company recognized gains of million related to sales of real estate properties through the company s non consolidated real estate investments 
the company reported a net loss of  on the sale of corporate debt and equity investments during  comprised of  gross gains of approximately million on corporate equity securities and  on corporate debt securities and mbs 
these gains were more than offset by gross losses of approximately million on corporate debt securities and losses of  on the sale of equity securities 
this compares to a net gain of  recognized during the year ended december  resulting from the sale of corporate debt  equity and mortgage backed securities 
during  the company recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of approximately million on its investment in rcn debt securities 
at december   the company held rcn debt securities  which were carried at their estimated fair value of approximately million 
in addition to the rcn debt securities  the corporate debt portfolio included other debt securities designated as held to maturity that were carried at their amortized cost of approximately million  and had estimated gross unrealized losses of approximately million 
the investment in level accounted for approximately million of the million unrealized loss 
management diligently monitors each debt and equity security investment  in order to identify asset credit quality issues on a timely basis 
this enables management to assess and  if necessary  change its position with regard to a particular debt or equity security 
future other than temporary impairment charges against investments  including the debt securities of level  may be recognized as a result of such assessments  the timing and amount of which would be based on the facts and circumstances at the time 
in general  the company s loss exposure due to credit issues related to debt and equity securities is limited  given that these investments comprised less than of the company s assets at december  general and administrative expenses for the company for the year ended december   increased approximately million as compared to such increase is primarily attributable to higher base management and incentive compensation fees earned by the advisor resulting from an increase in the company s stockholders equity and an increase in income generated by the company 
the company incurred costs in acquiring the advisor of approximately million  of which million was a non cash equity issuance  representing the fair value of the company s common stock issued in the advisor merger 
the company and the advisor merged effective am on january  as a result  the company became self advised and commencing january  and  thereafter  will directly incur the cost of all overhead necessary to operate the company 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  during the year ended december   total interest income earned by the company increased million  or  compared to total interest income earned in this increase is primarily attributable to a growth in the company s average interest earning assets from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
also contributing to the increase was a growth in the yield on the company s interest earning assets from per annum in to per annum in the company s interest expense increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to due to a increase in the average repurchase agreement balance from million in to million in  as well as an increase in the average interest cost from in to in the company had outstanding borrowings of million at december  compared to million at december  the company s net interest margin was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  as a result of the narrowing of such margin  net interest and dividend income decreased million  or  from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income from other investments increased from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
included in such income for the year ended december  is a gain of approximately million which resulted from the sale of the underlying real estate of an unconsolidated real estate limited partnership 
included in such income for the year ended december  is approximately million attributable to a gain recognized by a non consolidated subsidiary s sale of its undivided interests in the net assets of four assisted living centers 
excluding such sales  income from other investments increased  due to higher income generated by the company s investments in unconsolidated real estate limited partnerships 
during the year ended december   the company realized a net gain of  on the sale of investments compared to a net gain of  during the year ended december  such gains resulted from the sale of corporate debt and equity securities and the sale and or payoff of several pools of fixed rate mbs 
general and administrative expenses of the company decreased  or  for the year ended december  compared to approximately  of such decrease is due to expenses incurred in by a consolidated whichsubsidiary  which was liquidated in december the remainder of the decrease is primarily attributable to net decreases in various general and administrative expenses  including various servicing fees  filing fees and printing costs 
critical accounting policies management has the obligation to insure that its policies and methodologies are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
during management reviewed and evaluated its critical accounting policies and believes them to be appropriate 
the company s financial statements include the accounts of the company and all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to makes estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgements of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company does not believe that there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgement and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the company s accounting policies are described in note to the company s financial statements  included in item management believes the more significant of these to be as follows revenue recognition the most significant source of the company s revenue is derived from its investments in mbs 
the company reflects income using the effective yield method  which recognizes periodic income over the expected term of the investment on a constant yield basis  as adjusted for actual prepayment activity 
management believes the company s revenue recognition policies are appropriate to reflect the substance of the underlying transactions 
other than temporary impairment of investments the company s accounting policies require that management review its investment portfolio for potential other than temporary declines in vale on an investment by investment basis 
the majority of the company s investments are in mbs which are agency sponsored or credit enhanced and which management considers it unlikely that these securities  because of their nature  will experience substantial declines in value that are due to other than temporary market fluctuations 
for the companies other non real estate investments  management assesses on a quarterly basis significant declines in value which may be considered other than temporary and  if necessary  recognizes and accounting charge to write down the carrying value of such investments 
in making this assessment  management takes into consideration a wide range of objective and subjective information including but not limited to the following the magnitude and duration of historical decline in market prices  credit rating activity  assessments of liquidity and public filings and statements made by the issuer 
actual losses  if any  could ultimately differ from these estimates 
impairment of long lived assets real estate investments held directly or through joint ventures represent long lived assets for accounting purposes 
the company periodically reviews long lived assets to be held and used in operations for impairment in value whenever any events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
in management s opinion  based on this analysis  real estate assets and investments in joint ventures are considered to be held for investment and are not carried at amounts in excess of their estimated recoverable amounts 
income taxes the company s financial results generally do no reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes 
management believes that the company has and intends to continue to operate in a manner that will continue to allow it to be taxed as a real estate investment trust and as a result does not expect to pay substantial corporate level taxes 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
if the company were to fail to meet these requirements  the company would be subject to federal income tax 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
certain provisions of fas were amended by financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities fas in june  these statements provide new accounting and reporting standards for the use of derivative instruments 
prior the adoption of fas  the company did not engage in hedging activities as defined in fas and fas  although it was not precluded from doing so  for the purposes of managing interest rate risk 
as of january   the company had no outstanding derivative hedging instruments nor any imbedded derivatives requiring bifurcation and separate accounting under fas  as amended 
accordingly  there was no cumulative effect upon adoption of fas  as amended  on january  subsequent to the adoption of fas  as amended  the company has applied the provisions of fas  as amended 
in september   the fasb issued fas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities fas 
this statement is applicable for transfers of assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after march  the company adopted the provisions of this statement as required for all transactions entered into on or after april  the adoption of fas did not have a significant impact on the company 
in july   the fasb issued fas no 
 business combinations and fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas which provide guidance on how entities are to account for business combinations and for the goodwill and other intangible assets that arise from those combinations or are acquired otherwise 
these standards became effective for the company on january fas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
as of the date of adoption  the company had unamortized goodwill in the amount of approximately  amortization expense related to such goodwill was approximately  for the years ended december  and and  for the year ended december  the company s adoption of fas effective january   did not have a material effect on the company 
in october   the fasb issued fas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas 
fas provides new guidance on the recognition of impairment losses on long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of  and also broadens the definition of what constitutes a discontinued operation and how the results of a discontinued operation are to be measured and presented 
the provisions of fas are effective for the company on january  the adoption of fas did not have a significant impact on the company 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of liquidity consist of borrowings under repurchase agreements  principal payments received on its portfolio of mbs  cash flows generated by operations and proceeds from capital market transactions 
the company s principal uses of cash include purchases of mbs and  to a lesser extent  may include investments in corporate debt and equity securities and hedge instruments  payments for operating expenses  and the payment of dividends on the company s common stock 
repurchase agreements provided an additional billion to finance asset growth during  this increase in leverage was facilitated by the increase in the company s capital as a result of the public stock offerings completed in at december   borrowings under repurchase agreements were billion  compared to million at december  at december   repurchase agreements had a weighted average borrowing rate of  on loan balances of between  and million 
these agreements generally have original terms to maturity ranging from one month to months and interest rates that are typically based off of libor 
to date  the company has not had any margin calls on its repurchase agreements that it was unable to satisfy with either cash or additional pledged collateral 
during the year ended december   the company completed two public offerings  as detailed below  of its common stock  in which it issued approximately million shares  and raised net proceeds of approximately million 
the company s equity offerings were as follows price per gross offering settlement date number of shares share proceeds expenses net proceeds june   million million million nov 
  million million million include commissions  discounts and other offering expenses 
includes the full exercise of the underwriters option to purchase up to  additional shares to cover over allotments for the june  offering 
net proceeds were fully utilized to acquire additional adjustable rate mbs on a leveraged basis during the year ended december  on september   the company filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec relating to million of its common stock and preferred stock that the company may offer from time to time for cash in a variety of transactions  including underwritten public offerings the shelf registration 
the common stock offering completed by the company in november utilized a portion of the securities registered under this registration 
as of december   the company had million of securities remaining on the shelf registration 
to the extent the company raises additional equity capital from future sales of common and or preferred stock thispursuant to the shelf registration  the company anticipates using the net proceeds primarily to acquire additional adjustable rate mbs 
management may also consider additional interests in multifamily apartment properties and other investments consistent with its operating policies 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to raise additional equity capital at any particular time or on any particular terms 
on january   the company issued  shares of its common stock  generating net proceeds of approximately million in a public offering 
these shares were issued at per share  generating gross offering proceeds  before expenses  of approximately million 
the net proceeds were fully invested and will be fully leveraged to acquire additional mbs during the first quarter of following the completion of the january equity offering  the company had approximately million remaining on the shelf registration 
during  principal payments on mbs  generated cash of approximately million and operations provided a net of approximately million in cash 
in addition  the company also received proceeds of million from the sale of investments in corporate debt and equity securities during as part of its core investing activities  during  the company acquired billion of mbs 
other uses of funds during the year ended december   included million for dividend payments on the company s common stock 
in order to reduce interest rate risk exposure on a portion of the company s libor based repurchase agreements  the company entered into an interest rate cap agreement  costing  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
additional purchases of cap agreements are expected during  which will generate cash if interest rates increase beyond the rate specified in the individual agreement 
in addition  the company invested  in corporate equity securities during the company s restricted cash balance represents cash held on deposit with certain counterparties ie  lenders to satisfy margin calls on repurchase agreements 
the margin calls result from the decline in the value of the mbs securing repurchase agreements  generally due to principal reduction in the mbs from scheduled amortization and prepayments 
at december   the company had approximately of its repurchase agreements scheduled to roll ie  is contractually mature and payable to the counterparty within the first three months of  as reflected in the million increase  comparing restricted cash as of december  to december  at the time a repurchase agreement rolls counterparty  the company will apply the restricted cash against the repurchase agreement  thereby reducing the borrowing 
through december   the primary components of the company s general and administrative expenses were the base advisory and incentive fees paid to the advisor 
effective january   the company became a self advised reit  and thereafter will directly incur all cost associated with conducting the company s business 
management bbelieves that  under current market conditions  the additional costs incurred in operating mfa on a self advised basis will be less than the amount of the fees that would be payable to the advisor had the company remained an externally advised reit 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s expenses will actually be lower as a self advised reit 
the company believes it has adequate financial resources to meet its obligations as they come due and to fund committed dividends as well as to actively pursue its investment policies 
inflation virtually all of the company s assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors drive our performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates and changes in inflation rates 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and our dividends are based upon our net income as calculated for tax purposes  in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation 
other matters the company at all times intends to conduct its business so as to not become regulated as an investment company under the investment act 
if the company were to become regulated as an investment company  then  among other things  the company s ability to use leverage would be substantially reduced 
the investment act exempts entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring qualifying interests 
under the current interpretation of the staff of the sec  in order to qualify for this exemption  the company must maintain at least of its assets directly in qualifying interests 
in addition  unless certain securitiesmbs represent an undivided interest in the entire pool backing such mbs ie  whole pool mbs  such mbs may be treated as securities separate from the underlying mortgage loan and  thus  may not be considered qualifying interests for purposes of the exemption requirement 
accordingly  the company monitors its compliance with this requirement in order to maintain its exempt status 
as of december   the company determined that it is in and has maintained compliance with this requirement 
forward looking statements when used in this annual report on form k  in future sec filings  or in press releases or other written or oral communications  the words or phrases will likely result  are expected to  will continue  is anticipated  estimate  project or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements for purposes of section a if the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended and as such may involve know and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
these forward looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those relating to increases in the prepayment rates on the mortgage loans securing the company s mbs  changes in short term interest rates  the company s ability to use borrowings to finance its assets  risks associated with investing in real estate  including changes in business conditions and the general economy  changes in government regulations affecting the company s business  and the company s ability to maintain its qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
these risks  uncertainties and factors could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements it makes 
all forward looking statements speak only as the date they are made and the company does not undertake  and specifically disclaims  any obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements 
readers are cautioned that the company s actual results could differ materially from those set forth in such forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company seeks to manage the interest rate  market value  liquidity  prepayment and credit risks inherent in all financial institutions in a prudent manner designed to insure the longevity of the company while  at the same time  seeking to provide an opportunity to stockholders to realize attractive total rates of return through stock ownership of the company 
while the company does not seek to avoid risk  it does seek  to the best of its ability  to assume risk that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage such risk  to earn sufficient compensation to justify the taking of such risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks it does undertake 
interest rate risk the company primarily invests in adjustable rate and hybrid mbs 
the hybrid mbs represent fixed rate coupons for a specified period  generally three years  and thereafter converts to a variable rate coupon 
the company s debt obligations are generally repurchase agreements of limited duration  which are periodically refinanced at new market rates 
most of the company s adjustable rate assets are dependent on the one year cmt rate and debt obligations are generally dependent on libor 
these indexes generally move in parallel  but there can be no assurance that this will continue to occur 
the company s adjustable rate investment assets and debt obligations reset on various different dates for the specific asset or obligation 
in general  the repricing of the company s debt obligations occurs more quickly than the repricing of assets 
therefore  on average  the company s cost of funds may rise or fall more quickly than does its earnings rate on the assets 
further  the company s net income may vary somewhat as the yield curve between one month interest rates and six and month interest rate varies 
the following table presents the company s interest rate risk using the static gap methodology 
the table presents the difference between the carrying value of the company s interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at december   based on the earlier of term to repricing or the term to repayment of the asset or liability  scheduled principal amortization is not reflected in the table 
further  the adjustable rate mbs can be prepaid before contractual amortization and or maturity  which is also not reflected in the table 
the table does not include assets and liabilities that are not interest rate sensitive 
as of december   the company s investment assets and debt obligations will prospectively reprice based on the following time frames as of december  two less than three one year years to beyond three months to to two year three months one year years three years total in thousands interest earning assets adjustable rate mbs      fixed rate mbs   debt securities   equity securities   total interest earning assets       interest bearing liabilities repurchase agreements    total interest bearing liabilities    interest sensitivity gap       cumulative interest sensitivity gap      the difference between assets and liabilities repricing or maturing in a given period is one approximate measure of interest rate sensitivity 
when more assets than liabilities reprice during a period  the gap is considered positive and it is anticipated that earnings will increase as interest rates rise and earnings will decrease as interest rates decline 
when more liabilities reprice than assets during a given period  as is the case with respect to the company for periods less than one year  the gap is considered negative 
with a negative gap it is anticipated that income will decline as interest rates increase and income will increase as interest rates decline 
the static gap analysis does not reflect the constraints on the repricing of adjustable rate mbs in a given period resulting from periodic and life time cap features on these securities  nor the behavior of various indexes applicable to the company s assets and liabilities 
to a limited extent  the company uses interest rate cap agreements as part of its interest rate risk management 
the notional amounts of these instruments are not reflected in the company s balance sheet 
the cap agreements that hedge against increases in interest rates on the company s libor based repurchase agreements are not considered in the static gap analysis  as they do not effect the timing of the repricing of the instruments they hedge  but rather to the extent of the notional amount  cap the limit on the amount of interest rate change that can occur relative to the applicable of the hedged liability 
market value risk substantially all of the company s investments are designated as available for sale assets 
as such  they are reflected at their estimated fair value  with the difference between amortized cost and fair value reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
see note to the accompanying financial s statements included in item the market value of the company s mbs assets fluctuate primarily due to changes in interest rates and other factors  however  given that these securities are guaranteed by an agency of the u 
s 
government  such fluctuations are generally not based on the underlying credit worthiness 
to a lesser extent  the company designates certain corporate debt securities as held to maturity 
these debt securities  which are generally carried at amortized cost  comprised less than of the company s total assets at december  and are not considered core investments of the company 
however  any investment which suffers an impairment that is deemed to be other than temporary  whether designated as available for sale or held to maturity  will have its cost basis reduced and a corresponding charge made against earnings for the portion of the impairment that is identified as other than temporary 
see risk factors risks of decline in market value liquidity risk the primary liquidity risk of the company arises from financing long maturity assets with short term debt in the form of repurchase agreements 
the company had no long term debt at december  although the interest rate adjustments of these assets and liabilities are matched within the company s operating policies  maturities are not matched 
the company s assets which are pledged to secure short term borrowings are high quality  liquid assets 
as a result  the company has not had difficulty rolling over ie  renewing its short term debt as it matures 
however  the company cannot give assurances that it will always be able to roll over its short term debt 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million available to meet margin calls on repurchase agreements and for other corporate purposes 
prepayment and reinvestment risk as the company receives repayments of principal on its mbs  premiums on the corresponding securities are amortized and amortization is netted against interest income  discounts on mbs are accreted to income and increase interest income reported 
premiums arise when the company acquires a mbs at a price in excess of the principal value of the mortgages or par value if purchased at the original issue 
conversely  discounts arise when the company acquires a mbs at a price below the principal value of the mortgages  or par  if purchased at original issue 
for financial accounting purposes  the premium is amortized using the effective yield method  which reflects the effect of prepayments on amortization of premium and accretion of discounts 
greater than anticipated prepayments will accelerate the amortization of premiums  thereby reducing interest income 
for tax accounting purposes  the premium is amortized based on the asset yield at the purchase date 
therefore  on a tax basis  amortization of premiums will differ from those reported for financial purposes 
at december   the gross unamortized premium for adjustable rate mbs for financial accounting purposes was million of the adjustable rate mbs compared with million for federal tax purposes 
in general  the company believes it will be able to reinvest proceeds from scheduled principal payments and prepayments at acceptable yields  however  no assurances can be given that  should significant prepayments occur  market conditions would be such that acceptable investments could be identified and the proceeds reinvested 
tabular presentation the information presented in the following table  projects the impact of changes in interest rates on projected net income and net assets based on the investments in the company s portfolio on december   and includes all the company s interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the company acquires interest rate sensitive assets and funds them with interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the company generally plans to retain such assets and the associated interest rate risk to maturity 
change in percentage change percentage change interest rates in net income in net assets many assumptions used to generate this information and there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur as assumed or that other events will not occur that would affect the outcomes and therefore constitutes a forward looking statement 
the table quantifies the potential changes in net income should interest rates go up or down shocked by and basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
the cash flows associated with the adjustable rate assets  which are entirely comprised of adjustable rate mbs  for each rate shock are calculated based on a variety of assumptions  including prepayment vectors  yield on reinvested prepayments and scheduled amortization and growth in the portfolio 
assumptions made on the interest rate sensitive liabilities  which are entirely comprise of repurchase agreements  include anticipated interest rates on repurchase agreements  collateral requirements as a percent of the repurchase agreement and amount of borrowing 
furthermore  future sales  acquisitions  calls  and restructuring could materially change the company s interest rate risk profile 
when interest rates are shocked  these prepayment assumptions are further adjusted based on management s best estimate of the effects of changes on interest rates or prepayment speeds 
for example  under current market conditions  a basis point decline in interest rates is estimated to result in a increase in the prepayment rate of the adjustable rate mbs portfolio 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table
