market risk management the company is exposed to market risk stemming from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and  to a lesser extent  commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
in the normal course of business  exposure to certain of these market risks is managed by entering into hedging transactions authorized under company policies that place controls on these activities 
hedging transactions involve the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments 
derivatives are used only where there is an underlying exposure  not for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign operations the company has significant foreign operations  for which the functional currencies are denominated primarily in euro dollars  swiss francs  japanese yen and canadian dollars 
as the values of the currencies of the foreign countries in which the company has operations increase or decrease relative to the us dollar  the sales  expenses  profits  assets and liabilities of the company s foreign operations  as reported in the company s consolidated financial statements  increase or decrease  accordingly 
the company mitigates a portion of the fluctuations in certain foreign currencies through the purchase of foreign currency swaps  forward contracts and options to hedge known commitments  primarily for purchases of inventory and other assets denominated in foreign currencies 
interest rates the company s debt structure and interest rate risk are managed through the use of fixed and floating rate debt 
the company s primary exposure is to us interest rates 
the company also periodically enters into interest rate swaps  caps or collars to hedge its exposure and lower financing costs 
commodities certain components used in the company s products are exposed to commodity price changes 
the company manages this risk through instruments such as purchase orders and non cancelable supply contracts 
primary commodity price exposures are metals and packaging materials 
sensitivity to changes in value the estimates that follow are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value or earnings the company could lose in one year from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates or market interest rates under normal market conditions 
the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value or earnings that the company expects to incur 
the estimates do not consider favorable changes in market rates 
further  since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure  any loss or gain in the fair value of derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposures 
the positions included in the calculations are foreign exchange forwards  currency swaps and fixed rate debt 
certain instruments are included in both categories of risk exposure calculated below 
the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange positions that are hedged by these market risk sensitive instruments 
the table below presents the estimated maximum potential one year loss in fair value and earnings before income taxes from a movement in foreign currencies and a basis point movement in interest rate market risk sensitive instruments outstanding at september  estimated impact on earnings before income millions fair value taxes foreign exchange rate instruments interest rate instruments other factors the company has not been significantly impacted by inflationary pressures over the last several years 
the company anticipates that changing costs of basic raw materials may impact future operating costs and  accordingly  the prices of its products 
the company is involved in continuing programs to mitigate the impact of cost increases through changes in product design and identification of sourcing and manufacturing efficiencies 
price increases and  in certain situations  price decreases are implemented for individual products  when appropriate 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s management discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related footnote disclosures 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  pensions and other post retirement benefits  and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of ownership have passed to the buyer 
allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated at the individual operating companies based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses  adjusting for current economic conditions and  in some cases  evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
though the company considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which the company operates could have a favorable or unfavorable effect on reserve balances required 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost determined using the first in first out method or market 
management judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because the product is outdated or because the amount on hand is more than can be used to meet future needs 
inventory reserves are estimated at the individual operating companies using standard quantitative measures based on criteria established by the company 
the company also considers current forecast plans  as well as  market and industry conditions in establishing reserve levels 
though the company considers these balances to be adequate  changes in economic conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions could have a favorable or unfavorable effect on reserve balances required 
deferred taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
goodwill and intangible impairment in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangibles the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
on september  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and was required to analyze its goodwill for impairment issues during the first six months of fiscal  and then on a periodic basis thereafter 
as a result of this analysis  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million  net of tax  in the second quarter of fiscal warranties the company accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
the company s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience  expectation of future conditions and known product issues 
to the extent the company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  revisions to the estimated warranty reserve would be required 
the company engages in product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of its suppliers  to help minimize warranty obligations
