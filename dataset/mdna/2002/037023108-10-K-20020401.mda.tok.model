item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands  except per share amounts general the company s primary long term objective is to distribute consistent dividends supported by operating earnings 
the company considers its operating earnings to be net income available to common shareholders as determined under gaap before realized gains losses and fas hedging adjustments 
strong gaap operating earnings are primarily maintained by consistent credit performance on the company s investments and stability of the company s liability structure 
to achieve its objective the company is focused on increasing its size and capital base 
this should lead to increased diversification of credit exposures and improved diversification of financing sources creating a more stable earnings platform 
where increased size can be achieved without diluting common shareholders equity the company will pursue it aggressively 
the company s business focuses on i investing in below investment grade cmbs where the company has the right to control the foreclosure or workout process on the underlying loans  ii originating high yield commercial real estate loans  which includes senior interests in partnerships that own real property and are reported as real estate or joint venture investments  and iii acquiring investment grade real estate related securities  including government guaranteed residential mortgage backed securities to act as a liquidity support for the other two operations 
the company s management believes that this represents an integrated strategy where each asset class supports the others and creates additional value for shareholders over and above operating each in isolation 
the cmbs portfolio provides diversification and high loss adjusted returns over a weighted average life of approximately years  the commercial real estate loans provide high risk adjusted returns for shorter periods of time  and the investment grade securities is an actively managed portfolio that supports the liquidity needs of the company while earning attractive returns 
these strategies are pursued within an aggregate risk management framework that seeks to limit the exposure of the company s equity and earnings to changes in interest rates  capital availability and other factors beyond the company s control 
in the company continued to focus on maintaining liquidity  increasing capital base and reducing risk where feasible 
during  the company issued  shares of common stock for cash at levels that were accretive to shareholder book value 
in addition  of commercial assets were paid off in the first half of the year 
the company deployed most of its new capital and maturity proceeds into government guaranteed residential mortgages 
this strategy was highly effective in an environment in which the us economy was slowing 
the steep yield curve created by the federal reserve board s aggressive reduction of short term rates resulted in significant income opportunities for investments in this sector 
this further served to allow the company to maintain its cautious approach to the commercial real estate sector  yet still increase earnings per share 
this in turn put upward pressure on the dividends resulting in an increase in annualized dividends of per share  a increase 
invested equity in the investment grade portfolio reached a peak of at the end of the third quarter and fell to by the end of the fourth quarter of the company records these assets on its balance sheet in the categories securities available for sale investment grade securities and securities held for trading 
generally  the company has maintained of its invested equity in this sector to act as a liquidity reserve in support of commercial assets 
during the fourth quarter of  signs of improving economic activity in the united states began to appear  according to some sources and indications 
in reaction to this  the company began to hedge short term rates more actively and shifted its investment focus back to commercial real estate assets 
management saw the trend of tightening first mortgage underwriting and wider spreads was creating more favorable risk adjusted returns in the cmbs markets 
additionally  the feasibility of issuing term debt secured by these assets was improving through an increasingly active collateralized debt obligation cdo market 
during the fourth quarter of the company closed on approximately  par value of cmbs 
the focus of these acquisitions has generally been towards office and retail properties throughout the united states with less emphasis on lodging properties 
the company is also aggressively pursuing a matched funding strategy for its cmbs assets as greater liquidity in the capital markets increases the probability of executing a term financing transaction in the cdo market 
reportable earnings also benefited from economies of scale as the company has grown 
effective july  the manager reduced the base management fee payable to the manager under the management agreement by over on investment grade assets 
quarterly base management fees on a per share basis were per share for the quarter ended december   as compared to per share for the quarter ended december  additionally  the manager reduced the incentive fee  payable to the manager under the management agreement  by raising the threshold of its participation in income of the company from basis points over the year treasury for the quarter ended december  to the greater of that amount or 
this threshold is based on the adjusted issue price of the common stock 
at december   the adjusted issue price of the common stock was compared to the gaap book value of 
the increase to a threshold on adjusted issue price increased the earnings threshold from to per share and from to return on equity based upon december  gaap book value 
in aggregate  the fee reductions adopted by the manager increased return on equity by basis points  and increased gaap book value by per share  for the quarter ended december  critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the amounts reported in the company s consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing the financial statements  management is required to make various judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
the following is a summary of the company s accounting policies that are the most affected by management judgments  estimates and assumptions securities available for sale the company has designated its investments in mortgage backed securities  mortgage related securities and certain other securities as available for sale 
securities available for sale are carried at estimated fair value with the net unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
many of these investments are relatively illiquid  and their values must be estimated by management 
in making these estimates  management generally utilizes market prices provided by dealers who make markets in these securities  but may  under certain circumstances  adjust these valuations based on management s judgment 
changes in the valuations do not affect the company s reported income or cash flows  but impact stockholders equity and  accordingly  book value per share 
management must also assess whether unrealized losses on securities reflect a decline in value which is other than temporary  and  accordingly  write the impaired security down to its fair value  through earnings 
significant judgment is required in this analysis 
income on these securities is recognized based upon a number of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies 
examples of these include  among other things  the rate and timing of principal payments including prepayments  repurchases  defaults and liquidations  the pass through or coupon rate and interest rate fluctuations 
additional factors that may affect the company s reported interest income on its mortgage securities include interest payment shortfalls due to delinquencies on the underlying mortgage loans  and the timing and magnitude of credit losses on the mortgage loans underlying the securities that are a result of the general condition of the real estate market including competition for tenants and their related credit quality and changes in market rental rates 
these uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events which may alter the assumptions 
securities held for trading the company has designated certain other securities as held for trading 
securities held for trading are also carried at estimated fair value  but changes in fair value are included in income 
the valuations of these securities and the interest income recognized are subject to the same uncertainties as those discussed above 
mortgage loans the company purchases and originates commercial mortgage loans to be held as long term investments 
the company also has an investment in a private opportunity fund which invests in commercial mortgage loans  and is managed by the same entity that manages the company 
management must periodically evaluate each of these loans for possible impairment 
impairment is indicated when it is deemed probable that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
if a loan is determined to be impaired  the company would establish a reserve for possible losses  and a corresponding charge to earnings 
given the nature of the company s loan portfolio and the underlying commercial real estate collateral  significant judgment is required in determining impairment and the resulting loss allowance 
to date  the company has determined that no loss allowances have been necessary on the loans in its portfolio or held by the opportunity fund 
real estate joint ventures the company makes investments in real estate entities over which the company exercises significant influence  but not control 
the real estate held by such entities must be regularly reviewed for impairment  and would be written down to its estimated fair value  through earnings  if impairment is determined to exist 
this review involves assumptions about the future operating results of the real estate  and market factors  all of which are subjective and difficult to predict 
to date  the company has determined that none of the real estate held by its joint ventures is impaired 
derivative instruments the company utilizes various hedging instruments derivatives to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exposures or to modify the interest rate or foreign currency characteristics of related company investments 
all derivatives are carried at fair value  generally estimated by management based on valuations provided by the counterparty to the derivative contract 
for accounting purposes  company management must decide whether to designate these derivatives as hedging borrowings  securities available for sale  trading securities  or foreign currency exposure 
this designation decision affects the manner in which the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are reported 
market conditions and their effect on company performance the principal performance risks that the company faces are i credit risk on the cmbs and commercial real estate loans it underwrites  ii interest rate risk  which affects the market value of the company s assets and the cost of funds needed to finance these assets and iii liquidity risk  which affects the company s ability to finance itself over the long term 
credit risk and company performance the company s primary risk is commercial real estate credit risk 
these investments take two forms below investment grade cmbs commercial real estate loans 
cmbs are debt instruments with a stated par amount and a fixed or floating rate coupon 
the cash flow used to pay the cmbs comes from a pool of commercial real estate secured by first mortgages 
the credit losses that occur on the underlying mortgages are charged first to the cmbs with the lowest credit rating 
these cmbs are commonly referred to as the first loss securities 
commercial real estate loans are loans made directly to a borrower that are secured by some form of commercial real estate 
these loans may be secured by a subordinated interest in a first mortgage  a second mortgage  or interests in a partnership that owns commercial real estate 
additionally  the company has made preferred equity investments in partnerships that own commercial real estate 
cmbs the company considers delinquency information from the lehman brothers conduit guide for vintage transactions to be the most relevant measure of credit performance market conditions applicable to its below investment grade cmbs holdings 
the broader measure of all transactions tracked in the conduit guide since also provides relevant comparable information 
the delinquency statistics are shown in the table below lehman brothers conduit guide for vintage lehman brothers conduit guide for all transactions transactions date number of collateral number of collateral securitizations balance delinquent securitizations balance delinquent morgan stanley dean witter msdw also tracks cmbs loan delinquencies using a slightly smaller universe 
the msdw index tracks all cmbs transactions with more than  of collateral that have been seasoned for at least one year 
this will generally adjust for the lower delinquencies that occur in newly originated collateral 
as of december  the msdw index indicated that delinquencies on securitizations was 
as of december  this same index tracked securitizations with delinquencies of 
see the section titled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks for a detailed discussion of how delinquencies and loan losses affect the company 
the company s below investment grade cmbs portfolio has a total par amount of  of this amount   is the par of the securities that represent the first loss on the underlying mortgages  and  is the par of the securities that represent the remaining tranches owned by the company when the company owns the first loss security 
there are  underlying loans supporting the company s first loss cmbs with an aggregate principal balance of over billion as of december  the total below investment grade cmbs portfolio represents of invested equity at year end 
the company manages its credit risk through conservative underwriting  diversification  active monitoring of loan performance and exercise of its right to control the workout process as early as possible 
all of these processes are based on the extensive intranet based analytic systems developed by blackrock 
in underwriting loans  the company performs site inspections and or desktop reviews of all loans in the pools 
this process includes detailed analysis of regional economic factors  industry outlooks  project viability and documentation 
unacceptable risks are removed from the pool prior to closing the transaction 
an assumption of expected losses is developed and the securities are priced accordingly 
earnings are reported net of the assumption that credit losses will occur 
the company maintains diversification of credit exposures through its underwriting process and can shift its focus in future investments by adjusting the mix of loans in subsequent acquisitions 
during the company added  of par of first loss cmbs 
the collateral profile of the new investment was specifically underwritten to reduce the company s exposure to the lodging sector 
the comparative profiles of the loans underlying the company s cmbs by property type are exposure exposure property type loan balance of total loan balance of total multifamily   retail   office   lodging   industrial   healthcare   parking   total   active monitoring of loan performance is a critical function that is performed via electronic uploads of information gathered from the loan servicers  pnc bank and external data providers 
this internet based system allows the company to monitor payments  debt service coverage ratios  regional economic statistics  general real estate market trends and other relevant factors 
the company also uses the internet based system to monitor delinquencies 
the company updates this information monthly allowing for more detailed analysis of loans before problems develop 
the following table shows a comparison of these delinquencies number of of number of of principal loans collateral principal loans collateral past due days to days   past due days to days   past due days or more   real estate owned   total delinquent   total loan portfolio     of the delinquent loans as of december   two were delinquent due to technical reasons  one was reo and being marketed for sale  five were in foreclosure  and the remaining loans were in some form of workout negotiations 
aggregate realized losses of  were taken in this brings aggregate losses to  this is in line with the company s loss expectations as realized losses are expected to increase on the vintage loans as they age 
the subordinated cmbs owned by the company has a delinquency experience of  which is slightly better than for directly comparable collateral pursuant to the lehman brothers conduit guide for vintage transactions 
the company expects delinquencies to continue to rise throughout in line with expectations 
during the company also experienced early payoffs of  which represents of the year end pool balance 
these loans were paid off at par with no loss 
the anticipated losses attributable to these loans will be reallocated to the loans remaining in the pools 
subsequent to december   two of the delinquent loans were brought current and loans became delinquent 
additionally  two other loans with a total balance of  were paid off at par with no loss to the company 
the unrealized loss on the company s holdings of cmbs at december  was  this decline in the value of the investment portfolio represents market valuation changes and is not due to credit experience or credit expectations 
the adjusted purchase price of the company s cmbs portfolio as of december  represents approximately of its par amount 
the market value of the company s cmbs portfolio as of december  represents approximately of its par amount 
as the portfolio matures the company expects to recoup the unrealized loss  provided that the credit losses experienced are not greater than the credit losses assumed in the purchase analysis 
the company performs a detailed review of its loss assumptions on a quarterly basis and will adjust them when it believes that credit experience or expectations justify such an adjustment 
as of december  the company concluded that real estate credit fundamentals remain solid  and the company believes there has been no material change in the credit quality of its portfolio 
as the portfolio matures and expected losses occur subordination levels of the lower rated classes of a cmbs investment will be reduced 
this may cause the lower rated classes to be downgraded 
this would negatively affect the market value and liquidity of the portfolio 
commercial real estate markets there is typically a lagged impact of economic conditions on commercial real estate 
the most obvious fundamental impacts have been the precipitous drop in office demand and hence asking rents  a reduction in business travel and hence revpar in the lodging sector  a substantial increase in rent concessions by apartment operators and an increase in tenant bankruptcies  particularly in retail 
these effects will continue to be seen even as the public equity markets reflect economic recovery 
the often noted counterbalance to these negative demand factors is the better managed supply pipeline 
the far greater information availability and transparency of the real estate markets as compared to the s has clearly had a positive effect in aggregate on lender discipline 
aggregate construction starts were down across all property types in with the biggest year over year percentage declines in office and industrial 
the biggest decline by far over the past two years has been in hotel room additions  down 
despite the greater aggregate health of the markets  it is important to note that in new economy submarkets the company finds conditions as bad or worse than they were in the early s 
just as euphoria gripped sectors of the public equity markets  it similarly affected certain sectors of commercial real estate 
with cap rates trending up on softening fundamentals  the bid ask spread between buyers and sellers of property widened in and aggregate transaction volume declined by according to data from granite partners 
the biggest declines were in office and multifamily 
despite negative flows from foreign property funds the company believes there remains substantial liquidity available for us real estate equity investments with unspent allocations from pension funds likely representing the largest single source  and with equity reits prepared to invest as they see accretive opportunities 
commercial real estate loans the company also owns seven loans and two preferred equity interests in partnerships that own office buildings

interest rate risk and company performance the company generally makes investments at long term rates and borrows money to fund those investments at short term rates 
the level of short term rates and their relationship to long term rates directly affects the net investment income of the company 
the value of the company s assets is generally based on market rates for ten year us treasury notes and credit spreads 
the company generally pledges its assets when it borrows funds 
the value of the assets pledged affects the amount of money the company can borrow at a given time 
during the yield on the ten year us treasury note dropped by basis points from to 
during the yield on the ten year note was as low as and as high as 
short term rates decreased steadily throughout the year as one month libor decreased by basis points from to 
see below the section titled  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a detailed discussion of how interest rates and spreads affect the company 
credit spreads represent the premium above the treasury rates required by the market to take credit risk

s treasury securities libor difference december  december  the decrease in libor from december  to december  had a positive impact on the company s financing costs 
the company actively hedges its exposure to both short term and long term rates 
the degree of hedging and the choice of hedging instruments depends on market conditions 
this information is reviewed on a daily basis and changes are made accordingly 
the company uses a combination of interest rate futures contracts and interest rate swap agreements to hedge these exposures 
liquidity risk the company acquires its investments using its capital and borrowed funds 
the availability of funds is a key component of the company s operations 
during times of market uncertainty the availability of this type of financing can be very limited 
the company funds itself mainly through short term secured lending arrangements with various counterparties 
these arrangements are generally for day terms and are rolled over for day periods at the end of each term 
the company also has a committed borrowing facility from deutsche bank in the amount of million 
this facility matures in july of and is currently under negotiation to be extended 
the company s debt to equity ratio has been approximately throughout the three investment operations of the company are all financed on a secured basis at levels that takes into account the specific risks of that asset class 
as of december  the company s cmbs portfolio is financed at a debt to equity ratio of  commercial lending at  and while the high credit quality of the rmbs portfolio allows for financing levels of up to  the company operates this portfolio at much more conservative levels of generally the company maintains debt to equity ratios of on cmbs  on commercial lending and on rmbs 
the company manages this risk by maintaining diverse counterparties  keeping at least of invested equity in liquid assets and seeking matched funding opportunities in secured lending markets such as a cdo 
the investment grade assets portfolio acts as the store of liquidity and would be used to support the financing of the credit sensitive assets at times of impaired liquidity 
these assets can be sold quickly to raise cash in support of the company s main investment operations 
yields on residential mortgage backed securities fell steadily during the third quarter as evidence of a weaker economy  exacerbated by the terrorist attacks of september  continued to accumulate 
typically  yields of mortgage backed securities lag declines in other interest rates due to rising prepayment expectations 
this was generally the case during the quarter as yield spreads widened against both treasuries and interest rate swaps  particularly along the shorter end of the yield curve 
however  during the second half of september  the significant incremental yield of mortgage backed securities over other short and intermediate duration assets attracted sizable demand from financial institutions 
therefore  despite poor prepayment fundamentals and rising supply  demand indicators were exceptionally strong 
this trend reversed dramatically in the fourth quarter as yields were exceptionally volatile 
investors reduced interest rate exposure in anticipation of a reversal in federal reserve board policy 
the sell off was exacerbated by the lengthening durations of mortgage securities  which thereby increased the amount of securities that needed to be sold 
the combination of increased realized volatility and duration uncertainty hurt the sector during the quarter 
while rising interest rates should ultimately improve fundamentals and technicals for the sector  the violent nature of the sell off led to poor relative performance for mortgage backed securities during november and december 
during the company increased the size of the investment grade portfolio significantly 
the capital markets were favorable for issuing stock and the company took advantage of that opportunity 
the proceeds raised were invested immediately into the investment grade portfolio 
investments were generally made in fixed rate year government guaranteed residential mortgage backed securities issued by fnma or fhlmc 
the portfolio is comprised mainly of low coupon mortgages that were acquired at a slight discount to par 
this would serve to protect the company during periods of high pre payment 
the prepayment characteristics of rmbs generally cause the value of these securities to increase less in falling interest rate environments and decrease at a greater rate in rising interest rate environments 
the equity duration of this portfolio is generally hedged to five years using interest rate swaps and futures 
recent events in march the remaining  shares of the series a preferred stock were converted into  shares of company common stock at a price of per share pursuant to its terms 
in february  the company sold the fmact class c bond  resulting in a realized loss of  on march   the management agreement was extended for one year through march   with the unanimous approval of the unaffiliated directors  on terms similar to the prior agreement with the following changes  i the incentive fee calculation would be based on gaap earnings instead of ffo  ii removal of the four year period to value the investment agreement in case of termination  and iii subsequent renewal periods of the management agreement would be for one year instead of two years 
funds from operations ffo most industry analysts  including the company  consider ffo an appropriate supplementary measure of operating performance of a reit 
in general  ffo adjusts net income for non cash charges such as depreciation  certain amortization expenses and gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property 
however  ffo does not represent cash provided by operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the results of the company s performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
the company computes ffo in accordance with the definition recommended by the national association of real estate investment trusts 
the company believes that the exclusion from ffo of gains or losses from sales of property was not intended to address gains or losses from sales of securities as it applies to the company 
accordingly  the company includes gains or losses from sales of securities in its calculation of ffo

net interest margin and net interest spread from the portfolio the company considers its portfolio to consist of its securities available for sale  mortgage loan pools  commercial mortgage loans  and cash and cash equivalents because these assets relate to its core strategy of acquiring and originating high yield loans and securities backed by commercial real estate  while at the same time maintaining a portfolio of liquid investment grade securities to enhance the company s liquidity 
net interest margin from the portfolio is annualized net interest income from the portfolio divided by the average market value of interest earning assets in the portfolio 
net interest income from the portfolio is total interest income from the portfolio less interest expense relating to collateralized borrowings 
net interest spread from the portfolio equals the yield on average assets for the period less the average cost of funds for the period 
the yield on average assets is interest income from the portfolio divided by average amortized cost of interest earning assets in the portfolio 
the average cost of funds is interest expense from the portfolio divided by average outstanding collateralized borrowings

tax basis income was  or diluted per share  for the year ended december   compared to a net income as calculated in accordance with gaap of  or diluted per share 
differences between tax basis net income and gaap net income arise for various reasons 
for example  in computing income from its subordinated cmbs for gaap purposes  the company takes into account estimated credit losses on the underlying loans whereas for tax basis income purposes  only actual credit losses are taken into account 
additionally  in  payments made to gmac mortgage asset management  inc to terminate its management contract with core cap  inc were deducted for tax purposes 
certain general and administrative expenses may differ due to differing treatment of the deductibility of such expenses for tax basis income

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  credit curve spreads  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risks to which the company is exposed are interest rate risk and credit curve risk 
interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
credit risk is highly sensitive to dynamics of the markets for commercial mortgage securities and other loans and securities held by the company 
excessive supply of these assets combined with reduced demand will cause the market to require a higher yield 
this demand for higher yield will cause the market to use a higher spread over the us treasury securities yield curve  or other benchmark interest rates  to value these assets 
changes in the general level of the us treasury yield curve can have significant effects on the market value of the company s portfolio 
the majority of the company s assets are fixed rate securities valued based on a market credit spread to us treasuries 
as us treasury securities are priced to a higher yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the company s assets is increased  the market value of the company s portfolio may decline 
conversely  as us treasury securities are priced to a lower yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the company s assets is decreased  the market value of the company s portfolio may increase 
changes in the market value of the company s portfolio may affect the company s net income or cash flow directly through their impact on unrealized gains or losses on securities held for trading or indirectly through their impact on the company s ability to borrow 
changes in the level of the us treasury yield curve can also affect  among other things  the prepayment assumptions used to value certain of the company s securities and the company s ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets 
in addition  changes in the general level of the libor money market rates can affect the company s net interest income 
the majority of the company s liabilities are floating rate based on a market spread to us libor 
as the level of libor increases or decreases  the company s interest expense will move in the same direction 
the company may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of fluctuations in interest rates on its operations 
the use of these types of derivatives to hedge interest earning assets and or interest bearing liabilities carries certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of securities and  indeed  that such losses may exceed the amount invested in such instruments 
a hedge may not perform its intended purpose of offsetting losses or increased costs 
moreover  with respect to certain of the instruments used as hedges  the company is exposed to the risk that the counterparties with which the company trades may cease making markets and quoting prices in such instruments  which may render the company unable to enter into an offsetting transaction with respect to an open position 
if the company anticipates that the income from any such hedging transaction will not be qualifying income for reit income test purposes  the company may conduct part or all of its hedging activities through a to be formed corporate subsidiary that is fully subject to federal corporate income taxation 
the profitability of the company may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
the following tables quantify the potential changes in the company s net portfolio value and net interest income under various interest rates and credit spread scenarios 
net portfolio value is defined as the value of interest earning assets net of the value of interest bearing liabilities 
it is evaluated using an assumption that interest rates  as defined by the us treasury yield curve  increase or decrease and the assumption that the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
net interest income is defined as interest income earned from interest earning assets net of the interest expense incurred by the interest bearing liabilities 
it is evaluated using the assumptions that interest rates  as defined by the us libor curve  increase or decrease and the assumption that the yield curves of the libor rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
market value in this scenario is calculated using the assumption that the us treasury yield curve remains constant 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the respective values calculated in the scenario labeled as base case 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates as of december  and actual results could differ significantly from these estimates

default rates are subject to a wide variety of factors  including  but not limited to  property performance  property management  supply demand factors  construction trends  consumer behavior  regional economics  interest rates  the strength of the american economy  and other factors beyond the control of the company 
all loans are subject to a certain probability of default 
the nature of the cmbs assets owned are such that all losses experienced by a pool of mortgages will be borne by the company 
changes in the expected default rates of the underlying mortgages will significantly affect the value of the company  the income it accrues and the cash flow it receives 
an increase in default rates will reduce the book value of the company s assets and the company earnings and cash flow available to fund operations and pay dividends 
the company manages credit risk through the underwriting process  establishing loss assumptions  and careful monitoring of loan performance 
before acquiring a security that represents a pool of loans  the company will perform a rigorous analysis of the quality of substantially all of the loans proposed for that security 
as a result of this analysis  loans with unacceptable risk profiles will be removed from the proposed security 
information from this review is then used to establish loss assumptions 
the company will assume that a certain portion of the loans will default and calculate an expected  or loss adjusted yield based on that assumption 
after the securities have been acquired the company monitors the performance of the loans  as well as external factors that may affect their value 
factors that indicate a higher loss severity or timing experience is likely to cause a reduction in the expected yield and therefore reduce the earnings of the company  and may require a significant write down of assets 
for purposes of illustration  a doubling of the losses in the company s credit sensitive portfolio  without a significant acceleration of those losses would reduce the expected yield on adjusted purchase price from to approximately 
this would reduce gaap income going forward by approximately per common share per annum and cause a significant write down in assets at the time the loss assumption is changed to recapture income previously accrued above the revised loss assumption 
asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing and or maturing of assets and liabilities 
it is the objective of the company to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  management s strategy is to match the term of the company s liabilities as closely as possible with the expected holding period of the company s assets 
this is less important for those assets in the company s portfolio considered liquid as there is a very stable market for the financing of these securities 
the company uses interest rate duration as its primary measure of interest rate risk 
this metric  expressed when considering any existing leverage  allows the company s management to approximate changes in the net market value of the company s portfolio given potential changes in the us treasury yield curve 
interest rate duration considers both assets and liabilities 
as of december   and the company s duration on equity was approximately and years  respectively 
this implies that a parallel shift of the us treasury yield curve of basis points would cause the company s net asset value to increase or decrease by approximately and  respectively 
the difference in the value change when rates rise versus fall is attributable to the prepayment characteristics of the company s rmbs portfolio 
because the company s assets  and their markets  have other  more complex sensitivities to interest rates  the company s management believes that this metric represents a good approximation of the change in portfolio net market value in response to changes in interest rates  though actual performance may vary due to changes in prepayments  credit spreads and increased market volatility 
other methods for evaluating interest rate risk  such as interest rate sensitivity gap defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period  are used but are considered of lesser significance in the daily management of the company s portfolio 
the majority of the company s assets pay a fixed coupon and the income from such assets are relatively unaffected by interest rate changes 
the majority of the company s liabilities are borrowings under its line of credit or reverse repurchase agreements that bear interest at variable rates that reset monthly 
given this relationship between assets and liabilities  the company s interest rate sensitivity gap is highly negative 
this implies that a period of falling short term interest rates will tend to increase the company s net interest income while a period of rising short term interest rates will tend to reduce the company s net interest income 
management considers this relationship when reviewing the company s hedging strategies 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect the company s net interest income positively or negatively even if the company were to be perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the company currently has positions in forward currency exchange contracts to hedge currency exposure in connection with its commercial mortgage loan denominated in pounds sterling 
the purpose of the company s foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the company from the risk that the eventual us dollar net cash inflows from the commercial mortgage loan will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
the company s current strategy is to roll these contracts from time to time to hedge the expected cash flows from the loan 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates are not expected to have a material impact on the company s net portfolio value or net interest income
