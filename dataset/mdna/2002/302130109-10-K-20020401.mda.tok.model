beginning in  the company s primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from the far east to the united states and related customs brokerage and import services 
in the mid s  the company began to expand its service capabilities in export airfreight  ocean freight and distribution services 
today the company offers a complete range of global logistics services to a diversified group of customers  both in terms of industry specialization and geographic location 
as opportunities for profitable growth arise  the company plans to create new offices 
while the company has historically expanded through organic growth  the company has also been open to growth through acquisition of  or establishing joint ventures with  existing agents or others within the industry 
airfreight services airfreight services accounted for approximately   and percent of the company s   and consolidated revenues net of freight consolidation expenses net revenues  respectively 
when performing airfreight services  the company typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment 
when acting as a freight consolidator  the company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly from airlines 
when moving shipments between points where the volume of business does not facilitate consolidation  the company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the airline which carries the shipment 
whether acting as an agent or consolidator  the company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing  familiarity with local business practices  knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures  the ability to arrange for ancillary services  and assistance with space availability in periods of peak demand 
in its airfreight forwarding operations  the company procures shipments from its customers  determines the routing  consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point  and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point 
at the distribution point  the company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations 
the company estimates its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately  to  pounds and includes merchandise from several shippers 
because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation  air shipments are generally characterized by a high value to weight ratio  the need for rapid delivery  or both 
the company typically delivers shipments from a company warehouse at the origin to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets 
shipments normally arrive at the destination distribution point within forty eight hours after such delivery 
during peak shipment periods  cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur 
when these conditions exist  the company may charter aircraft to meet customer demand 
the company consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in cost effective combinations 
typically  as the weight or volume of a shipment increases  the cost per pound kilo or cubic inch centimeter charged by the company decreases 
the rates charged by airlines to forwarders and others also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases 
as a result  by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment  the company is able to obtain a lower rate per pound kilo or cubic inch centimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual shipment  while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment 
the company s net airfreight forwarding revenues from a consolidated shipment includes the differential between the rate charged to the company by an airline and the rate which the company charges to its customers  commissions paid to the company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services 
such ancillary services provided by the company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation  packing  crating and insurance services  negotiation of letters of credit  and preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws 
when the company acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment  its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customer 
the company does not own aircraft and does not plan to do so 
management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the company to undue business risks  including large capital outlays  increased fixed operating expenses  problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with airlines 
because the company relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments  changes in carrier policies and practices such as pricing  payment terms  scheduling  and frequency of service may affect its business 
the company also performs breakbulk services which involve receiving and breaking down consolidated airfreight lots and arranging for distribution of the individual shipments 
breakbulk service revenues also include commissions from non exclusive agents for airfreight shipments 
customs brokerage and import services customs brokerage and import services accounted for approximately   and percent of the company s   and consolidated net revenues  respectively 
as a customs broker  the company assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation  calculating and providing for payment of duties on behalf of the importer  arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies  and arranging for delivery 
the company also provides other services at destination including temporary warehousing  inland transportation  inventory manipulation and management  cargo insurance and product distribution 
the company provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles as a freight forwarder 
however  substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competing forwarder 
conversely  shipments handled by the company as a forwarder may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customer 
the company also provides custom clearances for goods moving by rail and truck between the united states  canada and or mexico 
the commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business required the company to make significant modifications to its systems and traditional office structure in order to provide competitive service 
during the company established a subsidiary  expeditors tradewin  llc  to respond to customer driven requests for high end customs consulting services 
the demand for these services was stimulated by the changes made by the us customs service in response to the customs modernization act 
fees for these non transactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed procedures 
there is currently a noticeable trend  prompted by customer demand  to quote rates on a door to door basis 
management foresees the potential  in the medium to long term  for fees normally associated with customs clearance to be de emphasized and included as a component of other services offered by the company 
ocean freight and ocean services ocean freight services accounted for approximately   and percent of the company s   and consolidated net revenues  respectively 
the company s revenues as an ocean freight forwarder are derived from commissions paid by the carrier and revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services which the company may provide  such as preparing documentation  procuring insurance  arranging for packing and crating services  and providing consultation 
the company operates expeditors international ocean eio  a non vessel operating common carrier nvocc specializing in ocean freight consolidation from the far east to the united states 
eio also provides service  on a smaller scale  to and from any location where the company has an office or agent 
as an nvocc  eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate 
eio solicits less than container load lcl freight to fill the containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping lines 
eio also handles full container loads for customers that do not have annual shipping volumes sufficient to negotiate comparable contracts directly with the ocean carriers 
the company does not own vessels and generally does not physically handle the cargo 
expeditors cargo management systems ecms supplies a sophisticated ocean consolidation service 
the company owns and maintains software that allows it to sell ecms to large volume customers that have signed their own service contracts with the ocean carriers 
as an ocean consolidator  ecms may obtain lcl freight from several vendors and consolidate this cargo into full containers 
the company s revenues as an ocean consolidator are derived from handling lcl cargo at origin and from the fees paid by customers for access to data captured during the consolidation process 
marketing and customers the company provides flexible service and seeks to understand the needs of the customers from points of origin to ultimate destinations 
although the domestic importer usually designates the logistics company and the services that will be required  the foreign shipper may also participate in this selection process 
therefore  the company coordinates its marketing program to reach both domestic importers and their overseas suppliers 
the company s marketing efforts are focused primarily on the traffic  shipping and purchasing departments of existing and potential customers 
the district manager of each office is responsible for marketing  sales coordination  and implementation in the area in which he or she is located 
all employees are responsible for customer service and relations 
the company staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics 
marketing and customer service staffs are responsible for marketing the company s services directly to local shippers and traffic managers who may select or influence the selection of the logistics vendor and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient service 
the company believes that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers  its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer service and marketing activities  and the incentives it gives to its managers have been important elements of its success 
the goods handled by the company are generally a function of the products which dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination 
shipments of computer components  other electronic equipment  housewares  sporting goods  machine parts  and toys  comprise a significant percentage of the company s business 
typical import customers include computer retailers and distributors of consumer electronics  department store chains  clothing and shoe wholesalers  manufacturers and catalogue stores 
historically  no single customer has accounted for five percent or more of the company s revenues 
competition the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future 
there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry  but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited 
depending on the location of the shipper and the importer  the company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities 
while there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into larger firms striving for immediate multinational and multi service networks  the regional and local competitors maintain a strong market presence 
historically  the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry have been price and quality of service  including reliability  responsiveness  expertise  convenience  and scope of operations 
the company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry 
recently  larger customers have exhibited a trend toward more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as just in time inventory management 
this trend has made computerized customer service capabilities a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers 
these computerized customer service capabilities include customized electronic data interchange  edi  and on line freight tracing and tracking applications 
the customized edi applications allow the transfer of key information between the customers systems and the company s systems 
freight tracing and tracking applications allow customers to know the location  transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transit 
management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the ongoing success of the company 
accordingly  the company has devoted a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that will meet these customer demands 
management believes that the company s existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competes 
developing these systems has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers 
small and middle tier competitors  in general  do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems 
as a result  there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry 
management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to medium term 
historically  growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant goodwill 
as a result  the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions 
the company s ability to attract  retain  and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential  if not the most important  element of its ability to compete in the industry 
to this end  the company has adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of branch revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel 
the company believes that these incentive compensation programs  combined with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts  provide it with a distinct competitive advantage and account for historical growth that competitors have matched only through acquisition 
currency and other risk factors the nature of the company s worldwide operations necessitate the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar 
this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference 
many of the countries where the company maintains offices and or agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure 
the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among these offices or agents 
in addition  the company s ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines  steamship lines and governmental agencies 
the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be good 
however  changes in space allotments available from carriers  governmental deregulation efforts  modernization of the regulations governing customs clearance  and or changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the company s business in unpredictable ways 
seasonality historically  the company s operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis 
the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest 
this pattern has been the result of  or influenced by  numerous factors including climate  national holidays  consumer demand  economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces 
in addition  this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company s international network and service offerings 
the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors  nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and  as a result  there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods 
a significant portion of the company s revenues are derived from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon just in time production schedules 
therefore  the timing of the company s revenues are  to a large degree  impacted by factors out of the company s control  such as shifting consumer demand for retail goods and manufacturing production delays 
additionally  many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter  and therefore  the company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter 
to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts  any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s stock 
environmental in the united states  the company is subject to federal  state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment 
similar laws apply in many foreign jurisdictions in which the company operates 
although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws  governments are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues  and the company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business 
the company does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during the remainder of the current or succeeding fiscal years 
employees at february   the company employed approximately  people   in the united states and in the balance of north america  in south america   in europe   in the far east australasia  in the near middle east and in africa 
approximately of the company s employees are engaged principally in sales and marketing and customer service   in operations and  in finance and administration 
the company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory 
in order to retain the services of highly qualified  experienced  and motivated employees  the company places considerable emphasis on its incentive compensation programs and stock option plans

lynch was elected corporate controller in january and vice president corporate controller in january regulation with respect to the company s activities in the air transportation industry in the united states  it is subject to regulation by the department of transportation dot as an indirect air carrier 
the company s overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation 
the company is licensed in each of its offices or in the case of its newer offices  has made application for a license  as an airfreight forwarder by the international air transport association iata 
iata is a voluntary association of airlines which prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members 
the majority of the company s airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines which are iata members 
the company is licensed as a customs broker by the customs service of the department of the treasury in each us customs district in which it does business 
all us customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by the customs service 
in other jurisdictions in which the company performs clearance services  the company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority 
the company is registered as an ocean transportation intermediary by the federal maritime commission fmc 
the fmc has established certain qualifications for shipping agents  including certain surety bonding requirements 
the fmc also is responsible for the economic regulation of nvocc activity originating or terminating in the united states 
to comply with these economic regulations  vessel operators and nvoccs  such as eio  are required to file tariffs electronically which establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the us the fmc has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties 
the company does not believe that current us and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations 
in general  the company conducts its business activities in each country through a majority owned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country 
however  the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to the company s ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a wholly or majority us owned subsidiary 
for example  foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding and or freight consolidation is restricted to local entities 
when the company encounters this sort of governmental restriction  it works to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the company the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation 
this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license 
in cases where the company has unilateral control over the assets and operations of the local entity  notwithstanding the lack of technical majority ownership of common stock  the company consolidates the accounts of the local entity 
in such cases  consolidation is necessary to fairly present the financial position and results of operations of the company because of the existence of the parent subsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting common stock 
cargo liability when acting as an airfreight consolidator  the company assumes a carrier s liability for lost or damaged shipments 
this legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value per pound unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge  except if the loss or damage is caused by willful misconduct or in the absence of an appropriate airway bill 
the airline which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent 
when acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper  the company does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline 
when acting as an ocean freight consolidator  the company assumes a carrier s liability for lost or damaged shipments 
this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge 
the steamship line which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent 
in its ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations  the company does not assume cargo liability 
when providing warehouse and distribution services  the company limits its legal liability by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or fifty cents per pound with a maximum of fifty dollars per lot which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track 
upon payment of a surcharge for warehouse and distribution services  the company will assume additional liability 
the company maintains marine cargo insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which it is legally liable 
the company also maintains insurance coverage for the property of others which is stored in company warehouse facilities 
item properties the company owns a  square foot office building in downtown seattle  a  square foot warehouse industrial office facility in nassau county  new york  a  square foot office facility near seattle tacoma international airport  an  square foot office and warehouse facility on a ten acre parcel near o hare international airport in chicago  a  square foot office facility in the tsim sha tsui east district of kowloon  hong kong  and a  square foot office facility in taipei  taiwan 
the company also owns a  square foot office and warehouse facility on a long term renewable land lease at the brussels cargo facility in brussels  belgium  and recently completed an  square foot office and warehouse facility in dublin  ireland 
the company leases and maintains additional offices and satellite locations in the united states and offices throughout the world  each located close to an airport  ocean port  or on an important border crossing 
the majority of these facilities contain warehouse facilities 
lease terms are either on a month to month basis or terminate at various times through as an office matures  the company will investigate the possibility of building or buying suitable facilities 
lease payments currently aggregate to approximately  per month 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that current leases can be extended and that suitable alternative facilities are available in the vicinity of each present facility should extensions be unavailable at the conclusion of current leases 
item legal proceedings the company is ordinarily involved in claims and lawsuits which arise in the normal course of business  none of which currently  in management s opinion  will have a significant effect on the company s financial position

such forward looking statements may be included in  but not limited to  press releases  oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer or in various filings made by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
the words or phrases will likely result  are expected to  will continue  is anticipated  estimate  project or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities litigation reform act 
such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to and are accompanied by the following discussion of certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements 
the risks included here are not exhaustive 
furthermore  reference is also made to other sections of this report which include additional factors which could adversely impact the company s business and financial performance 
moreover  the company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all of such risk factors  nor can it assess the impact of all of such risk factors on the company s business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
accordingly  forward looking statements cannot be relied upon as a guarantee of actual results 
shareholders should be aware that while the company does  from time to time  communicate with securities analysts  it is against the company s policy to disclose to such analysts any material non public information or other confidential commercial information 
accordingly  shareholders should not assume that the company agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of such statement or report 
furthermore  the company has a policy against issuing financial forecasts or projections or confirming the accuracy of forecasts or projections issued by others 
accordingly  to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections  forecasts or opinions  such reports are not the responsibility of the company 
risk factors discussion and potential significance international trade the company primarily provides services to customers engaged in international commerce 
everything that affects international trade has the potential to expand or contract the company s primary market 
for example  international trade is influenced by currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations  changes in governmental policies  changes in international and domestic customs regulations  wars  acts of terrorism  and other conflicts  natural disasters  changes in consumer attitudes regarding goods made in countries other than their own  and changes in the price and readily available quantities of oil and other petroleum related products 
third party vendors the company is a non asset based supplier of global logistics services 
as a result  the company depends on a variety of asset based third party vendors 
the quality and profitability of the company s services depend upon effective selection  management and discipline of third party vendors 
predictability of results the company is not aware of any accurate means of forecasting short term customer requirements 
however  long term customer satisfaction depends upon the company s ability to meet these unpredictable short term customer requirements 
personnel costs  the company s single largest variable expense  are always less flexible in the very near term as the company must staff to meet uncertain demand 
as a result  short term operating results could be disproportionately affected 
foreign operations the majority of the company s revenues and operating income come from operations conducted outside the united states 
to maintain a global service network  the company may be required to operate in hostile locations and in dangerous situations 
key personnel the company is a service business 
the quality of this service is directly related to the quality of the company s employees 
identifying  training and retaining key employees is essential to continued growth and future profitability 
continued loyalty to the company will not be assured by contract 
technology increasingly  the company must compete based upon the flexibility and sophistication of the technologies utilized in performing its core businesses 
future results depend upon the company s success in the cost effective development and integration of communication and information systems technologies 
growth to date  the company has relied primarily upon organic growth and has tended to avoid growth through acquisition 
future results will depend upon the company s ability to continue to grow internally or to demonstrate the ability to successfully identify and integrate non dilutive acquisitions 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general expeditors international of washington  inc is engaged in the business of global logistics management  including international freight forwarding and consolidation  for both air and ocean freight 
the company acts as a customs broker in all domestic offices  and in many of its international offices 
the company also provides additional services for its customers including value added distribution  purchase order management  vendor consolidation and other logistics solutions 
the company offers domestic forwarding services only in conjunction with international shipments 
the company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business 
the company does not own or operate aircraft or steamships 
international trade is influenced by many factors  including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad  currency exchange rates  and united states and foreign laws and policies relating to tariffs  trade restrictions  foreign investments and taxation 
periodically  governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions 
the company cannot predict which  if any  of these proposals may be adopted  nor can the company predict the effects adoption of any such proposal will have on the company s business 
doing business in foreign locations also subjects the company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises 
in addition to being affected by governmental policies concerning international trade  the company s business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies in the nations in which it does business 
the company s ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines  ocean steamship lines  and governmental agencies 
the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory 
however  changes in space allotments available from carriers  governmental deregulation efforts  modernization of the regulations governing customs brokerage  and or changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the company s business in unpredictable ways 
historically  the company s operating results have been subject to a seasonal trend when measured on a quarterly basis 
the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest 
this pattern is the result of  or is influenced by  numerous factors including climate  national holidays  consumer demand  economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces 
in addition  this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company s international network and service offerings 
the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and  as a result  there can be no assurance that historical patterns  if any  will continue in future periods 
a significant portion of the company s revenues are derived from customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand  and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon just in time production schedules 
therefore  the timing of the company s revenues are  to a large degree  impacted by factors out of the company s control  such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods and or manufacturing production delays 
additionally  many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter  and therefore  the company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter 
to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts  any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates management believes that the nature of the company s business is such that there are few  if any  complex challenges in accounting for operations 
while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting  the company s use of estimates is limited primarily to the areas of accounts receivable valuation  the useful lives of long term assets and the accrual of costs related to ancillary services the company provides areas that in the aggregate are not a major component of the company s statement of earnings 
management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are non aggressive in approach and consistent in application 
management believes that there are limited  if any  alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to the company s transactions 
while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates  the company believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reported 
results of operations the following table shows the consolidated net revenues revenues less transportation expenses attributable to the company s principal services and the company s expenses for  and  expressed as percentages of net revenues 
with respect to the company s services other than freight consolidation  net revenues are identical to revenues 
management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues of the relative importance of the company s principal services since total revenues earned by the company as a freight consolidator include the carriers charges to the company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the company in its other capacities include only the commissions and fees actually earned by the company

expeditors cargo management systems ecms  a pc based ocean freight consolidation management and purchase order tracking service  continued to be instrumental in attracting new business 
the company s north american export ocean freight net revenues increased in compared to this increase was a result of the company handling more ocean shipments moving from north america to the far east and  to a lesser extent  from north america to europe 
ocean freight net revenues from the far east and from europe increased and  respectively  for compared with customs brokerage and import services revenues increased in as compared with as a result of the company s growing reputation for providing high quality service  consolidation within the customs brokerage market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program  and the growing importance of distribution services as a separate and distinct service offered to existing and potential customers 
distribution services accounted for nearly of the increase in customs brokerage and import services revenues for compared with salaries and related costs increased in compared to as a result of the company s increased hiring of sales  operations  and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and increased compensation levels 
salaries and related costs increased as a percentage of net revenues 
the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee 
using this compensation model  changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company profits 
management believes that the growth in revenues  net revenues and net earnings for are a result of the incentives inherent in the company s compensation program 
other operating expenses increased in as compared with as rent expense  communications expense  quality and training expenses  and other costs expanded to accommodate the company s growing operations 
other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased in as compared with management believes that this decrease was significant as it reflects the successful achievement of cost containment objectives initiated at the branch level 
the ability to sustain these savings into future periods is contingent upon branch level management s ability to adhere to these objectives 
other income  net  increased in as compared to primarily due to interest income earned on higher cash balances and short term investments in management attributes higher cash balances  in large part  to the success of cash management and billing improvement initiatives 
the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions  as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations 
the company s consolidated effective income tax rate in was  down marginally from the rate experienced in the prior year 
the 
decrease was caused primarily by a reduction in state tax expense required to be paid by the company

salaries and related costs decreased as a percentage of net revenues 
management believes that this decrease is due to the company s ability to service larger freight volumes with a relatively smaller group of people 
management attributes this to technological enhancement and operational process improvement initiatives

the company s consolidated effective income tax rate remained relatively constant in at 
currency and other risk factors international air ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future 
there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry  however  the company s primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group 
while there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into large firms with multinational offices and agency networks  regional and local broker forwarders remain a competitive force 
historically  the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry have been price and quality of service  including reliability  responsiveness  expertise  convenience  and scope of operations 
the company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry 
customers have exhibited a trend towards more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as just in time inventory management 
accordingly  sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers 
developing these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers 
smaller and middle tier competitors  in general  do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network 
as a result  there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry 
management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to medium term 
the nature of the company s worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar 
this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference 
some of the countries where the company maintains offices and or agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure 
the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents 
the company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the company s ability to move money freely around the world or the short term financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most time sensitive way to avoid short term exchange losses 
any such hedging activity during  and was insignificant 
net foreign currency losses realized in were  net foreign currency gains realized during and were  and  respectively 
the current year losses were recognized primarily as a result of intercompany obligations with the company s subsidiaries in brazil  taiwan  indonesia and turkey 
the company has traditionally generated revenues from airfreight  ocean freight and customs brokerage and import services 
in light of the customer driven trend to provide customer rates on a door to door basis  management foresees the potential  in the medium to long term  for fees normally associated with customs house brokerage to be de emphasized and included as a component of other services offered by the company 
on january   eleven of fifteen member countries of the european union  later joined by greece in january  established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legacy currencies and a new common currency the euro 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions 
the conversion to the euro eliminates currency exchange rate risk between the member countries 
beginning in january  new euro denominated bills and coins were issued and legacy currencies began to be withdrawn from circulation 
the company has worked diligently to address the issues raised by the euro currency conversion including the need to adapt computer systems and business processes to accommodate euro denominated transactions 
the conversion costs were not material 
due to numerous uncertainties  the company is evaluating the effects one common european currency will have on pricing 
the company is unable to predict the resulting impact  if any  on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has not experienced any significant disruption as a result of this phased conversion 
sources of growth historically  growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant goodwill  the value of which can be realized in large measure only by retaining the customers and profit margins of the acquired business 
as a result  the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions  where future economic benefit significantly exceeds the goodwill recorded in the transaction 
office additions the company opened start up offices and one office through an acquisition during the office added through an acquisition is followed by an asterisk 
europe south america africa north america united kingdom brazil madagascar usa belfast  northern ireland curitiba antananarivo nashville  tennessee bristol  england germany venezuela nuremberg caracas switzerland chiasso internal growth management believes that a comparison of same store growth is critical in the evaluation of the quality and extent of the company s internally generated growth 
this same store analysis isolates the financial contributions from offices that have been included in the company s operating results for at least one full year 
the table below presents same store comparisons on a year over year basis for the years ended december   and same store comparisons for the years ended december  net revenues operating income liquidity and capital resources the company s principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was approximately million  as compared with million for this million increase is principally due to increased net earnings  decreased accounts receivable and increased accounts payable  accrued expenses and taxes payable 
the company s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality 
historically  the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings 
this results in positive cash flow 
the increased activity associated with peak season typically commencing late second or early third quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections 
this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash 
in the past  the company has utilized short term borrowings to satisfy normal operating expenditures when temporary cash outflows exceed cash inflows 
these short term borrowings have been repaid when the trend reverses and customer collections exceed customer billings 
during  short term borrowings were not required in the united states  the market where cash flow pressures are most intense due to funds advanced in association with customs brokerage activity 
as a customs broker  the company can make significant business day cash advances for the payment of duties and freight 
these advances are made as an accommodation for a select group of credit worthy customers 
cash advances are a pass through and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense  but are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable 
as a result of these pass through billings  the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  as compared with million during the same period of the largest use of cash in investing activities is cash paid for capital expenditures 
for the year ended december   the company made capital expenditures of million as compared with million for the same period in capital expenditures in and in related primarily to investments in technology and office furniture and equipment 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million as compared with cash used in financing activities of million for the same period in in  the company paid down million on short term debt  as compared with million for the same period of the company uses the proceeds from stock option exercises to repurchase the company s stock on the open market 
the differences shown at year end of and between proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the amounts paid to repurchase common stock represent a timing difference in the receipt of proceeds and the subsequent repurchase of outstanding shares 
during the third quarter of  the board of directors authorized management to repurchase  shares of the company s common stock 
the difference shown at the end of between proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the amounts paid to repurchase common stock is primarily due to the repurchase of stock under the discretionary plan authorized by the board of directors in september the repurchase of all  shares was completed on october  at an average price of per share 
in november  the board of directors expanded the company s discretionary stock repurchase program to allow for the repurchase of such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to  shares of common stock 
as of december   no shares had been repurchased under the amended discretionary plan 
at december   working capital was million  including cash and short term investments of million 
the company had no long term debt at december  while the nature of its business does not require an extensive investment in property and equipment  the company cannot eliminate the possibility that it could acquire an equity interest in property in certain geographic locations 
the company currently expects to spend approximately million on property and equipment in in addition to normal capital expenditures for leasehold improvements  warehouse equipment  computer hardware and furniture and fixtures  this total includes estimates for a building project in egypt 
the company expects to finance capital expenditures in  with cash 
the company borrows internationally under unsecured bank lines of credit 
the international bank lines of credit totaled million 
in addition  the company maintains a bank facility with its uk bank for million 
at december   the company was directly liable for million drawn on these lines of credit and was contingently liable for an additional million from standby letters of credit and guarantees related to these lines of credit and other obligations 
at december   the company s contractual obligations and other commitments are as follows payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years contractual obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other obligations see note c total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands total amounts committed less than year years years over years other commitments lines of credit credit facility standby letters of credit guarantees total commitments the company has a non discretionary stock repurchase plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises 
as of december   the company had repurchased and retired  shares of common stock at an average price of per share over the period from through the company also has a discretionary stock repurchase plan under which it retired  shares of common stock as of october   at an average price of per share 
in november  this plan was expanded to allow for the repurchase of such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to  shares of common stock 
as of december   no shares had been repurchased under the amended discretionary plan 
management believes that the company s current cash position  bank financing arrangements  and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
in some cases  the company s ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls 
at december   cash and cash equivalent balances of million were held by the company s non us subsidiaries  of which million was held in banks in the united states 
in addition  certain undistributed earnings of the company s subsidiaries accumulated through december  would  under most circumstances  be subject to some additional united states income tax if distributed to the company 
the company has not provided for this additional tax because the company intends to reinvest such earnings to fund the expansion of its foreign activities  or to distribute them in a manner in which no significant additional taxes would be incurred 
impact of inflation to date  the company s business has not been adversely affected by inflation  nor has the company experienced significant difficulty in passing carrier rate increases on to its customers by means of price increases 
direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to medium term period 
due to the high degree of competition in the market place  these rate increases might lead to an erosion in the company s margins 
however  as the company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest rate sensitive indebtedness  the company currently has no direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates 
the forward looking statements contained in this document involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements include  but are not limited to risks associated with foreign operations  elimination of intercompany transactions  matching of expenses with the associated revenue  seasonality  shifts in consumer demand  the effect that the implementation of the euro as the primary currency of member states of the european union might have on the global economy and the company s international and domestic customers  other accounting estimates and other risk factors disclosed from time to time in the company s public reports 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business 
these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in short term interest rates 
the potential impact of the company s exposure to these risks is presented below foreign exchange risk the company conducts business in many different countries and currencies 
the company s business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred 
in the ordinary course of business  the company creates numerous intercompany transactions 
this brings a market risk to the company s earnings 
foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the company s earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar  the company s functional currency  relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business 
all other things being equal  an average weakening of the us dollar  throughout the year ended december   would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately million 
an average strengthening of the us dollar  for the same period  would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately million 
the company has approximately million of intercompany transactions unsettled at any one point in time 
the company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the company s ability to move money freely around the world 
any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december   was insignificant 
the company instead follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings 
the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within days and intercompany billings arising in the normal course of business are fully settled within days 
interest rate risk at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million and short term borrowings of million  all subject to variable short term interest rates 
a hypothetical change in the interest rate of would have an insignificant impact on the company s earnings 
in management s opinion  there has been no material change in the company s market risk exposure between and
