at brite line technologies  gross margin decreased to in from in as a result of product mix and lower sales margins to foreign markets  partially offset by improved manufacturing overhead absorption resulting from increased production volumes 
selling  general and administrative expenses are incurred and recorded in both plymouth tapes and brite line technologies 
certain of the selling  general and administrative expenses recorded in plymouth tapes could be considered as incurred for the benefit of brite line  but are currently not allocated to that segment

selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  decreased to in from in at plymouth tapes  selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  decreased to in from in  and total selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to  from  in the decrease in expenses included  of lower freight and  of decreased external warehouse expenses  due to lower volumes and a reduction in the number of warehouses  a  decrease in environmental expenses  a  reduction in salaries and fringe due to headcount and salary reductions   of reduced commissions due to lower sales levels   of lower professional fees   of reduced advertising   lower travel expenses  and  of lower foreign selling expenses 
these reductions were partially offset by a  bad debt increase from  which benefited from a reversal of  in february   km logistics  a third party freight audit and payment service  filed for chapter bankruptcy protection  while holding approximately  of company funds intended to reimburse the company s freight carriers for normal services 
approximately  of these payments were made to km logistics prior to fiscal year end 
due to the bankruptcy filing  the company provided a reserve for the full amount of the funds held by km logistics at november  this charge is included as a selling  general and administrative expense at plymouth tapes in the fourth quarter of fiscal a loss of approximately  will be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal for the funds remitted to km logistics after november  the company intends to pursue all legal means of recovery of the  balance 
at brite line  selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  decreased to in from in the largest factors were a  decrease in professional fees  a  reduction in travel expenses  a  reduction in field equipment expenses  and a  reduction in accrued commissions  partially offset by a  increase in freight expense and a  increase in product license fees

in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  a full valuation allowance was recorded for this benefit as it could not be carried back to recover taxes paid and will not be offset by the reversal of future taxable differences 
the company s liquidity situation at november  also provides significant negative evidence regarding its ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to realize this benefit 
the us dollar is the functional currency for the company s us operations 
for these operations  all gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in income currently 
the company operates a wholly owned subsidiary in spain  which accounted for of the company s revenues in fiscal the functional currency of this subsidiary has been the peseta and will be the euro in changes in the peseta euro dollar exchange rate could affect the reporting of the subsidiary s earnings in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company occasionally enters into purchase or sales contracts in currencies other than the functional currency  and hedges only those transactions that are of significant size 
the company did not enter into any foreign currency forward contracts in and and did not have any forward contracts outstanding at the end of and fiscal year compared with fiscal year sales decreased to  weeks from  weeks in plymouth tapes sales of  were down from sales in the automotive market decreased approximately  largely due to weak fourth quarter sales 
sales in all other markets combined increased  partially offsetting the automotive decrease 
sales at brite line technologies decreased to  from  in  largely due to lower than expected reorder business  unacceptable pricing in europe due to currency exchange rates  and unfavorable spring weather conditions in certain key market regions 
gross margin decreased to from in plymouth tapes gross margin decreased to from in the major factor driving this decrease was rising raw material purchase prices during fiscal  primarily for pvc resins  which increased product costs significantly compared to  and which the company was largely unable to pass along to customers 
the resultant margin decrease was estimated to be  for the year 
another factor was extensive time during july and early august that was necessary to install and debug capital equipment additions and improvements 
the resultant low production output produced a large overhead absorption variance  estimated at approximately  lower direct labor utilization  and lower sales due to the temporary inability to produce certain products 
overall processing yields were also significantly unfavorable compared to  and were a significant contributor to the lower gross margin 
one large component of the lower processing yields was the installation and startup costs for certain coating equipment 
in addition  manufacturing costs were higher for certain automotive products  due to product development activities 
increases were also experienced in indirect labor  equipment repair  healthcare  and utility costs 
lower contractual selling prices  mainly to a major automotive customer  also contributed approximately  to the margin decrease  as did unfavorable european pricing caused by currency exchange rates 
slightly offsetting this was the gross margin at brite line technologies  which increased to from in selling  general and administrative expenses were incurred and recorded in both plymouth tapes and brite line technologies 
certain of the selling  general and administrative expenses recorded in plymouth tapes could be considered as incurred for the benefit of brite line  but were not allocated to that segment 
these expenses included certain management  accounting  personnel and sales services  and a limited amount of travel  insurance  directors fees and other expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  decreased to from in the major source of the decrease was brite line technologies  where selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  decreased to from in the major factor was a decrease in professional fees to  from  in  due largely to costs in associated with a patent infringement lawsuit 
salaries in brite line technologies also decreased by approximately  due in large part to a reduction in accrued bonuses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  in plymouth tapes decreased slightly to from in the major factor reducing expenses was a  decrease in bonus and profit sharing 
there was also a  decrease in professional fees and a  decrease in advertising 
these decreases were largely offset by a  increase in environmental expenses  an increase in salary and fringe of  a freight expense increase of  and a bad debt expense increase of  operating income for included an insurance settlement with one of the company s previous liability insurance carriers 
under the terms of the agreement  the insurance carrier made a one time payment of  in exchange for a release of all past  present  and future environmental claims 
interest expense increased to  from  in the increase occurred because of both higher average loan balances approximately  higher and higher interest rates approximately higher on the revolving line of credit in compared to this was partially offset by slightly lower average balances for term debt 
as a result of the above factors  income before taxes in decreased to a loss of  compared to a profit of  in fiscal results benefited from a one time insurance recovery of  and were adversely affected by  in expense connected with patent litigation 
in accordance with the statement of financial accounting no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  management performed an analysis of the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
fas requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company increased the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets by  such an increase was deemed necessary as the net deferred tax asset balance at december  could not be carried back to recover taxes paid in previous years and will not be offset by the reversal of future taxable differences 
also  the company s liquidity situation at december  provides significant negative evidence regarding the ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to recover these assets 
the increase in the valuation allowance resulted in a  tax expense for fiscal  compared to a  tax expense in net income for fiscal decreased to a loss of  compared to a profit of  in liquidity and capital resources the company s term debt agreements contain various covenants which specify that the company meet certain financial requirements  including minimum tangible net worth  fixed charge coverage ratio and working capital and maximum ratio of total liabilities to net worth 
in addition  the revolving working capital credit facility and the real estate term loan contain an acceleration provision  which can be triggered if the lender subjectively determines that an event of default has occurred 
the company has been in default of certain covenants of its term debt facility as of each quarter end since september   and therefore  due to a cross default provision  the company was also not in compliance with a covenant under its revolving working capital credit facility and real estate term loan 
as of november   the company was not in compliance with the minimum working capital  fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum ratio of total liabilities to net worth covenants under its term debt agreements  resulting in the working capital  real estate term loan and term debt facilities being payable on demand  although no such demand has been made to date 
as a result  all of the company s term loans except for that of its spanish subsidiary remain classified as current liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheet at november  and december   respectively 
as of november   the company had delayed  in principal payments on its term debt and capital lease facilities 
as of november   the company had approximately  of unused borrowing capacity under its million line of credit with its primary working capital lender  after consideration of collateral limitations and a letter of credit related to a guarantee of million pesetas approximately million on a term loan agreement with a spanish bank syndicate 
the company s working capital position decreased from a negative  at december  to a negative  at november   due to a  increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  a  reduction in inventory  a  increase in short term debt  and a  of other working capital decreases  partially offset by a  decrease in the current portion of long term debt  and a  increase in accounts receivable 
the company is obligated to contribute  to its defined benefit plan for the plan year ending november  based upon cash flow projections for fiscal and the lack of available borrowing capacity under its debt facilities  the company will not have sufficient funds to satisfy this obligation 
the company has filed for a funding waiver from the internal revenue service for the  payments due for the plan year ending november  the company has generated net losses of  and  during the years ended november  and december   respectively 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the negative working capital position of  the demand status of the term debt facilities  the lack of significant borrowing capacity under the line of credit  available at november   the funding requirement for the defined benefit plan and the recurring losses generated from operations during fiscal and  may indicate that the company will be unable to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainity 
since september   the company has been negotiating with its lenders to defer principal payments and modify the financial covenants under its existing debt facilities 
in december   the company reached an agreement with its primary term debt lender to defer principal payments from august   through march   and to modify the financial covenants 
in january   an agreement also was reached with the company s working capital lender to defer certain principal payments on the real estate term loan from december  through march  however  these two agreements will not be deemed effective until all other lenders have agreed to similar terms  interest payments are current  and several other conditions are met 
the company anticipates that it will be able to negotiate similar agreements with the remaining lenders 
beyond march   the company plans to continue to pursue restructured debt facilities and or deferred principal payments at least through the end of fiscal it is management s belief that if payments of interest and principal on the company s debt facilities can be deferred and the internal revenue service grants a pension funding waiver for the plan year ending november   as described above  cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity needs during fiscal although management expects to be able to accomplish its business and financing plans  there is no assurance that it will be able to do so 
the company s plans depend upon many factors  including those outlined in the safe harbor statement below 
failure to accomplish these plans could have an adverse impact on the company s liquidity  financial position  and ability to continue operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at november   the carrying value of company s debt totaled million which approximated its fair value 
this debt includes amounts at both fixed and variable interest rates 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at november   the company had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million 
holding other variables constant such as foreign exchange rates and debt levels a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the unrealized fair market value of fixed rate debt by approximately  the earnings and cash flows impact for the next year resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be approximately  holding other variables constant
