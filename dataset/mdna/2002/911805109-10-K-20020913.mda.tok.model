item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of significant factors which have affected our liquidity  capital resources and results of operations during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements 
the discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
due to uncertainties in our business  actual results may differ materially from the discussion below 
critical accounting policies oil and gas producing activities we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
accordingly  all costs associated with acquisition  exploration  and development of oil and gas reserves  including directly related overhead costs  are capitalized 
once we begin production  all capitalized costs of oil and gas properties including the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves  will be amortized on the unit of production method using estimates of proved reserves 
investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
such assessments could cause the company to reduce the carrying values of the properties 
in addition  the capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test  which basically limits such costs to the aggregate of the estimated present value  discounted at a percent interest rate of future net revenues from proved reserves  based on current economic and operating conditions  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
sales of proved and unproved properties are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas  in which case the gain or loss is recognized in income 
abandonments of properties are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs with no loss recognized 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  our cash position increased by  over the prior balance at may  to a cash balance of  this increase came as a result of  and  being generated in investing activities and financing activities  respectively 
this increase in cash of  was offset by a reduction of  which was consumed in operations 
operations for the fiscal year ended may   resulted in a net loss of  the major noncash components of the net loss for the year were depreciation of  impairment of goodwill of  services which were paid for with our common stock  gain on the sale of assets of  provision for bad debts of  noncash compensation of  and the net change in assets and liabilities of  during december  we purchased equity in rocky mountain gas  inc rmg from certain minority shareholders under the terms of their initial investment which allowed for a conversion to shares of our common stock if certain conditions were not met 
subject to those conversion terms  we purchased  shares of rmg stock adding to our original consolidated ownership an additional ownership interest in rmg  by issuing a total of  shares of our common stock at per share 
an impairment of  was taken on this investment in rmg during the third quarter of fiscal as rmg had no production and to bring the total investment in rmg carried on our books in line with the fair market value of rmg assets  the impairment was taken 
during fiscal  there were shares of our common stock and warrants issued to our outside directors and consultants  which were valued at a total of  in a noncash payment for services rendered 
our directors received  shares of our common stock valued at  for annual director s fees  consultants received  shares of our common stock in exchange for  in consulting services and other consultants and investors received warrants valued at  the  in noncash compensation was through the funding of our esop with  shares of our common stock valued at  and the amortization of various company stock bonus plans in the amount of  we sold our controlling interest in ruby mining company ruby to admiralty corporation admiralty of atlanta  georgia in fiscal admiralty has developed technology that differentiates ferrous from non ferrous metals in sea water 
this technology is used to explore for and recover sunken treasures 
admiralty paid us  and signed a promissory note for  for the purchase of ruby 
admiralty defaulted on the payment of the promissory note 
as a result  we recorded a provision for doubtful accounts for the balance due under the admiralty note of  investing activities provided  during fiscal the primary components of this source of cash was the sale of an interest in rmg s coalbed methane properties to ccbm  inc ccbm of houston  texas for  proceeds of  from the sale of various surplus equipment  and a net change of  in the investment we have in affiliated companies 
uses of cash in investing activities were the expenses incurred in the development of rmg s coalbed methane properties of  increased value of restricted investments of  through the reinvestment of interest earned on those investments  and the purchase of  of equipment 
rmg assigned ccbm an undivided interest in all of rmg s existing coalbed methane properties with the exception of castle rock of which only a working interest was assigned for the purchase price of  by a promissory note payable in principal amounts of  per month plus interest at per annum over months starting on july  with a balloon payment due on the forty second month 
the note is secured by a pledge of ccbm s interest in the properties of rmg being purchased by ccbm 
all payments on the promissory note principal   were taken against our full cost pool of coalbed methane gas properties 
ccbm has made all payments due under the terms of the promissory note 
ccbm also agreed to pay  to drill and complete coalbed methane wells on rmg s properties 
one half of this amount   will be credited against any drilling or property development costs that are the obligation of rmg 
as of may   the total amount expended by ccbm towards this work commitment was  leaving a balance under the work commitment of  approximately half of which will be spent to cover rmg s commitments in the development of the joint properties 
rmg did expend  in the development of coalbed methane properties during fiscal  which were outside the work commitment of ccbm 
we maintain cash investments in the amount of  that are dedicated to reclamation liabilities and cannot be used for operations of the company 
these investments earn interest annually which is used to pay licensing fees on our uranium mill in southern utah 
any unused earned interest proceeds are reinvested into the restricted investments 
during fiscal  restricted investments increased by financing activities during fiscal provided  these proceeds were generated from the sale of common stock of the company and its subsidiary rmg in the amount of  and proceeds from long term debt   these cash proceeds from financing activities were partially offset by repayments of the company s line of credit and other long term debt in the amounts of  and  respectively 
the company sold  shares of it common stock in private placements for a total of  employees of the company also exercised options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock for  rmg sold  shares of its common stock in a private placement to outside investors for  these shares of rmg stock were converted to common shares of the company s common stock as discussed above 
on may   the company entered into a debt financing agreement with an independent company 
the company secured  in debt through this transaction which bears interest of per annum and is due quarterly commencing on september  collateral for the loan is a junior security interest in the assets of the company 
the entire debt is due on or before may  at the option of the lending company  all or any portion of the debt may be repaid with the common stock of the company or rmg  at the rate of per share for company shares  or per share for rmg shares 
in addition  the lending company received detached warrants to purchase  shares of the company and  shares of rmg s common stock at and per share  respectively and a beneficial conversion provision 
the company therefore recognized a discount on the  loan in the total amount of  the balance of the increase in long term debt was for the financing of prepaid insurance and the financing of miscellaneous assets 
working capital increased by  from  at may  to working capital of  at may  this increase in working capital was primarily as a result of the increased cash receipts discussed above 
capital resources the primary sources of our capital resources are cash on hand  collection of receivables  receipt of monthly payments from ccbm for the purchase of an interest in rmg s coalbed methane properties  ccbm funding of drilling and development programs  projected production from rmg s coalbed methane properties  sale of excess mine  construction and drilling equipment  sale of real estate properties which are no longer needed in the core business of the company  sale of partial ownership interest in mineral properties  proceeds under the line of credit  equity financing of the company s subsidiaries  and the final determination of the sheep mountain partners smp arbitration litigation 
we will also continue to receive revenues from our commercial operations in southern utah 
drilling and development capital requirements will be satisfied for the majority of fiscal from the ccbm work commitment of which there is  remaining as of may  approximately one half of this amount will be paid by ccbm on behalf of rmg for its obligations for drilling and property development of coalbed methane properties 
there is also a balance of  due from ccbm under its purchase agreement 
under the terms of the promissory note  this amount will continue to be paid at the rate of  per month plus interest until november at which time a balloon payment of  is due 
ccbm s interest in rmg s coalbed methane properties is pledged as security for the note to rmg 
after ccbm has paid  of the principal amount of the promissory note  rmg will release of the undivided interest in the coalbed methane properties purchased by ccbm  another when  of the principal is paid  and the balance of the total undivided interest when all of the principal amount of  of the purchase price has been paid 
under the agreement with ccbm  ccbm also agreed to use its best efforts to obtain financing to raise no less than million to be used by rmg to acquire more coalbed methane properties 
ccbm has not been successful in raising these funds within the terms of the agreement due to market conditions for coalbed methane gas 
rmg has extended the time for ccbm to raise the funds to june  if ccbm is unsuccessful in raising the funds to purchase additional coalbed methane properties or for any reason determines to discontinue participation in the development of rmg s coalbed methane properties  rmg will continue to seek equity or industry funding to develop its properties 
the company has shut down it mines and has discontinued its mining and construction operations 
it therefore has surplus equipment and buildings from these operations 
during fiscal and  the company sold the majority of its surplus equipment 
in addition  the company owns various raw land which is held as investment property or were intended to be used in mining operations 
these properties are no longer needed for the core business of the company and will be sold 
the company currently has an offer to sell a piece of property in california which was previously held for the development of a mill tailings site for its subsidiary sutter gold mining company  sgmc 
this property was never developed for a tailings site so has no reclamation liability 
the company continues to market home and mobile home lots in southern utah 
these fully developed properties are not important to the operations of the company 
the lots were a portion of the assets that the company acquired when it purchased the shootaring uranium mill and ticaboo townsite 
the company has also listed the commercial operations at ticaboo for sale 
it is the intention of management of the company to sell this commercial property 
the company also has determined to sell the shootaring uranium mill 
it is the goal of the company s management to sell the mill as a unit but proposals to sell the mill parts have also been considered 
no firm proposal is currently being considered on the mill 
to assist in financing the holding costs of the sutter gold properties which are shut down  the company developed a mine tour business 
after operating the mine tour business for approximately one year  it was determined to lease out the tour business 
proceeds under the lease agreement partially defray the holding costs of the mine property 
the company is currently discussing the potential of either a sale of the property to an industry partner or a possible joint venture agreement to operate the property 
equity financing will be required to develop the mine and mill complex 
a decision to further develop the property at sutter is contingent on the price of gold 
we currently have a  line of credit with a commercial bank 
as of may   this line of credit has been drawn down by  the line of credit will be renewed in september of due to the sale of mining equipment  which was held as collateral for the line of credit  the limit of the line of credit may be reduced 
we also have a  line of credit through our affiliate plateau resources 
this line of credit is for the development of the ticaboo townsite in southern utah 
plateau has drawn down  of this financing facility which is repayable over years 
all payments on these lines of credit are current as of the filing date of this report 
we have been involved in litigation with nukem  inc involving smp for the past eleven years 
the us district court of colorado has appointed a special master to determine the value of the purchase rights  the pounds of uranium and the profits under certain contracts nukem entered into with cis republics  which contracts have been placed in a constructive trust 
the special master is currently performing the accounting 
the federal court has ordered that the accounting be completed and filed with the court by december  with a further status hearing to be held on december  the ultimate outcome of this litigation cannot be determined but management of the company believes that it will be beneficial to the company 
we believe that these cash resources will be sufficient to sustain operations during fiscal capital requirements the primary capital requirements during fiscal are expected to be development of coalbed methane properties  the cost of maintaining our uranium properties that are shut down  the sgmc gold properties holding costs  and general and administrative costs 
estimated capital requirements for fiscal are  for the development and holding costs of coalbed methane properties  costs to maintain uranium properties and associated real estate assets in the amount of  gold properties holding costs of  and general and administrative costs of  these allocations and estimates may vary depending on the level of acquisition and drilling rmg participates in during the year 
development of coalbed methane properties the majority of the fiscal development costs associated with the coalbed methane properties of rmg has been funded through the ccbm agreement 
under the ccbm purchase and sale agreement  if properties are drilled that are owned by rmg  we may be required to fund the drilling costs for the interest ownership of the remaining non participating parties 
should we be required to fund any non participating entities portion of the development programs  there is a back in provision on each property which gives rmg a disproportionate amount of the production revenues until our cost and additional amounts are recovered before the non participating parties begin to receive production funds 
maintaining mineral properties smp uranium properties the care and maintenance costs associated with the uranium mineral properties formerly owned by sheep mountain partners smp  are approximately  per month 
we continue to implement cost cutting measures to reduce the holding cost while at the same time preserving the assets 
we have begun the process of reclamation on certain of these mine properties and will continue to do work during fiscal it is estimated that  in reclamation work will be completed on the smp mine properties during fiscal the company is seeking final approval from the regulatory agencies of the reclamation work completed on the gmix water treatment plant during fiscal plateau resources uranium properties plateau owns the ticaboo townsite  which includes a motel  convenience store  boat storage  restaurant and lounge 
prior to fiscal  we operated all of these entities 
a decision was made to lease out all but the motel operations during fiscal this decision relieved us of the obligation and expense of employees  inventory and risk of loss from the business operations 
additionally  plateau owns and maintains the tony m uranium mine and shootaring canyon uranium mill 
we are pursuing alternative uses for these properties including the potential sale of the uranium mill 
there are no major reclamation projects anticipated on the mill or mine properties during fiscal sutter gold mining company gold properties due to the depressed market price of gold  the development of the gold properties has been deferred until the price of gold improves 
in the meantime  sgmc developed a tourism business to cover the holding costs of the properties 
a decision was made to lease out the tourism business to a third party 
the revenues received from the lease cover a majority of our holding costs associated with the mine  shop and mineral leases 
we have one employee at the sgmc properties to preserve the core assets and properties 
sgmc is in the process of evaluating the potential of selling certain of the nom essential land positions that it has acquired in developing a mine plan 
sgmc is also considering other alternatives such as equity financing or obtain industry partners to develop the property in the event that market prices reach to the level to warrant placing the properties into production 
carrying values for the sgmc properties  as of may   are lower than the fair market value of the properties 
these assets consist primarily of raw land that was purchased for a mill tailings cell but is no longer needed under the new mine development plan 
the land is in the path of a proposed highway development project by the state of california 
debt payments debt to non related parties at may  was  as compared with  at may  the increase in debt to non related parties of  consists of debt incurred to finance annual insurance premiums of  purchase of equipment of  and the convertible debt in the amount of  from an independent company which was discounted by  for detached warrants and a beneficial conversion provision  which will be amortized over the life of the debt 
during fiscal the company made payments on outstanding debt in the amount of  payment requirements on this debt during fiscal is  of interest on the convertible debt and  in principal payments on the balance of the debt 
principal requirements of long term debt are      and  for fiscal through  respectively 
at may   the company borrowed  under its  line of credit with a commercial bank 
the line of credit is to be renewed in september of federal income tax issues during fiscal  the internal revenue service irs audited our books and records for the fiscal years ended may  and the audits have been completed and all issues agreed to 
there were no changes in the amount of taxes due as a result of these audits 
all issues through may  are now settled and the years through then are closed 
reclamation costs the reclamation obligations are long term and are either bonded through the use of cash bonds or the pledge of assets 
it is anticipated that only  of reclamation work will be performed during fiscal the reserves to pay the reclamation obligations are either real estate holdings of the company that are pledged or restricted cash investments 
the reclamation liability on the plateau uranium mining and milling properties in utah is  which is reflected on the balance sheet as a reclamation liability 
this liability is fully funded by cash investments that are recorded as long term restricted assets 
the reclamation costs of the sheep mountain uranium properties in wyoming are  and are covered by a reclamation bond which is secured by a pledge of certain of our real estate assets 
the reclamation requirements for the sgmc gold properties is approximately  this reclamation obligation is bonded with a cash bond 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues revenues from operations decreased by  to  during fiscal from the  recognized during fiscal components of this decrease are reductions of  in motel  real estate and airport operations  mineral sales of  mineral royalties of  and management fees of  mineral sales during fiscal resulted from purchase of uranium oxide on the open market to fill uranium sales contracts and the sale of a uranium contract to a third party 
we did not supply any of the uranium sold under the contracts from production out of our mines 
we have not produced any minerals from mines for several years 
the uranium contracts expired and no molybdenum advance royalties have been received since the reduction of motel  real estate and airport operations of  was primarily as a result of reduced revenues at our ticaboo motel in southern utah 
the reduction in revenues in the tourism business is attributed to the general decline in the economy as well as the negative effect that the terrorist attacks have had on people s desire to travel 
there were no mineral sales during fiscal while there was one delivery under a uranium contract as well as the sale of one of the company s uranium contracts to a third party during fiscal currently the company does not have any delivery contracts for uranium or any other mineral 
depending on the outcome of the smp litigation  the company may well have cis pounds of uranium for which it will need to obtain delivery contracts 
the company holds a royalty on the mt 
emmons molybdenum deposit near crested butte  co 
under the provisions of the royalty agreement  the company and crested are to receive  pounds of molybdenum or its cash equivalent annually as an advance royalty 
the royalty agreement was originally made with amax  inc  which was purchased by cyprus minerals company in and changed its name to cyprus amax minerals company cyprus amax 
in  cyprus amax was purchased by phelps dodge corporation 
amax and cyprus had made the advance royalty payments to usecc on a timely basis 
phelps dodge made one advance royalty payment and ceased making payments in fiscal phelps dodge has suspended payments under the advance royalty agreement and has sued the company 
the company has filed counter claims against phelps dodge requesting that the advance royalty and other issues be reinstated 
it is not known what the outcome of this litigation will be 
management fees were reduced by  in fiscal from the prior period due to reduced activity in the entities from which management fees are collected 
costs and expenses during fiscal  costs and expenses were reduced by  this reduction was as a result of reduced activity in our commercial operations in southern utah because some of the operations were leased to third parties  and the general economy turned down as a result of terrorist attacks 
this reduced both revenues as discussed above and costs and expenses of  the holding costs of mineral properties were reduced by  as a result of the company reducing costs associated with mineral properties that are shut down 
the general and administrative costs were reduced by  in addition to these reductions in costs and expenses  the company recognized an expense of  in abandonment of mining equipment during fiscal there was no abandonment expense in fiscal these reductions in costs and expenses were offset by increases in impairment of goodwill of  provision for doubtful accounts of  and other expenses of  the impairment of goodwill came as a result of the company purchasing an additional of rmg equity or  shares of rmg stock by issuing  shares of the company s common stock 
the shares of the company s common stock were valued at per share 
an impairment of  was taken on this investment in rmg as rmg had no gas production and the impairment brought the total investment in rmg in line with the fair market value of the rmg assets 
a provision for doubtful accounts was provided on the balance of a note receivable that the company held for the sale of ruby mining company to admiralty corporation 
the note was in the original amount of  and had been reduced to  the note went in default during fiscal at which time the company began negotiations with admiralty to resolve the issue of the outstanding balance 
terms were reached which required admiralty to pay interest on the note  plus accrued interest  through august  at which time the entire note balance would come due 
due to the financial condition of admiralty  it is not known if that company will be able to pay off the balance of the note 
the entire amount of the note was therefore reserved 
other income and expenses gain on sale of assets income decreased by  during fiscal to  this decrease was as a result of the sale of a majority of the surplus mining equipment that the company had for sale during the prior year 
during fiscal  there was no income from litigation settlements while during fiscal there was  in litigation settlement as a result of the company settling all issues appertaining to the kennecott litigation 
interest income increased by  during fiscal over fiscal as did interest expense which increased by  for the same period 
these increases were as a result of larger amounts invested in interest bearing accounts and increased debt 
operations for the twelve months ended may  resulted in a net loss of  or per share as compared to net income of  or per share for the previous year 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues operating revenues during fiscal decreased  from revenues for the previous year to  this decrease was primarily as a result of a decrease in revenues from motel  real estate and airport operations 
this decrease was offset by increases in mineral sales and management fees 
during fiscal  we recorded  in revenues from mineral sales compared with no mineral sales revenue during the previous year 
the increase was the result of the sale of a uranium delivery contract to a non affiliated company  and a delivery of uranium made under that market related contract before the sale of the contract 
there were no similar sales of uranium during the same period of the prior year 
the company purchased the uranium necessary to deliver to its contract 
the company has not produced uranium for several years 
revenues from motel  real estate and airport operations decreased from  at may  to  at may  this decrease is as result of the mine tour at sgmc and the boat storage  restaurant and convenience store operations being leased to third parties by plateau during fiscal management fees increased  to  during fiscal this increase was due to rmg operations on which we receive a management fee 
costs and expenses costs and expenses decreased by  during fiscal to  from  during the previous year 
this reduction in costs and expenses came as a result of reduced motel  real estate and airport operations expense of  and general and administrative costs and expenses of  these reductions in costs and expenses were offset by increases in mineral holding costs and expenses of  and abandonment of mining equipment of  general and administrative costs during fiscal were significantly higher than those experienced during fiscal due to a noncash charge to operations of  as a result of the issuance of common shares of rmg stock below the market 
other reductions in general and administrative costs and expenses during fiscal were related to a reduction of staff 
other income and expenses as a result of the settlement of the kennecott litigation   was recorded as revenue during fiscal this revenue has two components noncash revenues as a result of the recognition of  of a deferred gmmv purchase option payment that was received in and the receipt of cash from kennecott as a result of the settlement   net of accounts receivable from gmmv 
during the fiscal  we recognized a gain of  from the sale of equipment that was determined to be surplus 
one component of this amount was the sale of certain gmmv assets that were distributed to the company from the gmmv upon the resolution of the kennecott litigation 
the other main components of this increase are the final royalty payment received from the sale of the brunton company of  and the sale of a real estate property in colorado of  operations for the fiscal year ended may   resulted in earnings of  or per share fully diluted as compared to a loss of  or per share fully diluted for the fiscal year ended may  future operations we have generated operating losses in each of the last three years as a result of costs associated with shut down mineral properties 
we have maintained some of our investments in gold and uranium properties that have not generated operating revenues 
these properties require expenditures for items such as permitting  care and maintenance  holding fees  corporate overhead and administrative expenses 
success in the minerals industry is dependent on the price that a producer can receive for its minerals 
we cannot predict what the long term price for gold and uranium will be and therefore cannot predict when  or if  we will generate net income from these operations 
at may  we are committed to be in the coalbed methane business well into the future 
uranium prices and market projections are being evaluated 
decisions to liquidate part or all of the company s uranium holdings are being considered 
we are also evaluating its commitment to the gold business depending on the price for gold recovering 
effects of changes in prices mineral operations are significantly affected by changes in commodity prices 
as prices for a particular mineral increase  prices for prospects for that mineral also increase  making acquisitions of such properties costly  and sales advantageous 
conversely  a price decline facilitates acquisitions of properties containing that mineral  but makes sales of such properties more difficult 
operational impacts of changes in mineral commodity prices are common in the mining industry 
natural gas 
our decision to expand into the coalbed methane gas industry were predicated on the projections for natural gas demand and prices 
uranium and gold 
changes in the prices of uranium and gold will affect our operational decisions in the future 
currently  both gold and uranium are at low prices 
we continually evaluate market trends and data 
we do not plan to go forward with any work on our uranium and gold properties until the market price for these metals increase and remain at profitable levels 
molybdenum and oil 
changes in prices of molybdenum and petroleum are not expected to materially affect our operations during fiscal
