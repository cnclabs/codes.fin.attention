an acquisition of two small distribution systems accounted for  of the  increase in customers 
usage per residential customer has been steadily declining for the past several years in large part as a result of higher energy prices and more energy efficient appliances and home construction 
usage  calculated on a temperature adjusted basis  has decreased by  and in  and  respectively 
temperatures in were near normal  however  temperatures have been warmer than normal for nine of the last ten years 
the financial impact of actual weather variations from normal are minimized by a weather normalization adjustment in rates 
industrial deliveries were flat in and higher in an increase in natural gas volumes used to generate electricity offset lower deliveries to a steel producer 
in  the steel producer announced plans to reorganize under protection of bankruptcy laws 
margins from gas delivered to industrial customers are substantially lower than margins from gas delivered to residential and commercial customers 
a significant increase in purchased gas costs in the second half of and the first quarter of resulted in higher charges to customers but did not directly affect the margin 
the recovery of gas costs is authorized through rate regulation in utah and wyoming 
gas costs in utah rates  which peaked at per dth in a january  filing  have subsided to per dth in a january  gas cost filing 
in  of questar gas supplies came from company owned reserves  which cost less than gas purchased from third party suppliers 
operating expenses operating and maintenance expenses were higher in due largely to a million increase in bad debt expenses that more than offset labor savings from a fourth quarter early retirement program 
an economic recession  increased number of bankruptcies and higher energy costs resulted in more frequent collection problems

critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
management believes the following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment 
successful efforts accounting for gas and oil operations under the successful efforts method of accounting  the company capitalizes the costs of acquiring leaseholds  drilling development wells and successful exploratory wells and purchasing related support equipment and facilities 
the costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells are charged to expense when it is determined that such wells have not located proved reserves 
unproved leaseholds costs are periodically reviewed for impairment 
costs related to impaired prospects are charged to expense 
costs of geological and geophysical studies and other exploratory activities are expensed as incurred 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
the company recognizes gain or loss on the sale of properties on a field basis 
capitalized proved leasehold costs are depleted on the unit of production method based on proved reserves on a field basis 
all other capitalized costs associated with oil and gas properties are depreciated on the unit of production method based on proved developed reserves on a field basis 
the company engages independent consultants to calculate gas and oil reserves 
reserve estimates are based on a complex and highly interpretive process that is subject to continuous revision as additional production and development drilling information becomes available 
wexpro settlement agreement wexpro s operations are subject to the terms of the wexpro settlement agreement 
the agreement was effective august   and sets forth the rights of questar gas utility operations to share in the results of wexpro s operations and the rate of return that wexpro will earn for managing questar gas reserves 
the agreement was approved by the pscu and pscw in and affirmed by the supreme court of utah in accounting for derivatives on january   the company adopted the accounting provisions of sfas  as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas addresses the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
under the standard  the company is required to carry all derivative instruments in the balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in fair value  which result in gains or losses  of a derivative instrument depends on whether such instrument has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and  if so  depends on the reason for holding it 
the company structured virtually all of its energy derivative instruments as cash flow hedges 
any changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet until the underlying gas or oil is produced 
the cumulative effect of this accounting change decreased other comprehensive income by million after tax and did not have a material effect on income at adoption 
of the cumulative effect recorded in other comprehensive income  million after tax was reclassified into the consolidated income statement during revenue recognition revenues are recognized in the period that services are provided or products are delivered 
the company s exploration and production operations use the sales method of accounting for gas revenues  whereby revenue is recognized on all gas sold to purchasers 
a liability is recorded to the extent that the company has an imbalance in excess of its share of remaining reserves in an underlying property 
rate regulation rate regulatory agencies establish rates for the storage  transportation and sale of natural gas 
the regulatory agencies also regulate  among other things  the extension and enlargement or abandonment of jurisdictional natural gas facilities 
regulation is intended to permit the recovery  through rates  of the cost of service  including a return on investment 
the financial statements of rate regulated businesses are presented in accordance with regulatory requirements 
methods of allocating costs to time periods  in order to match revenues and expenses  may differ from those of other businesses because of cost allocation methods used in establishing rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk questar s primary market risk exposures arise from commodity price changes for natural gas  oil and other hydrocarbons and changes in long term interest rates 
the company has an investment in a foreign operation that may subject it to exchange rate risk 
a market resources subsidiary has long term contracts for pipeline capacity for the next several years and is obligated to pay for transportation services with no guarantee that is will be able to recover the full cost of these transportation commitments 
hedging policy the company has established policies and procedures for managing commodity price risks through the use of commodity based derivative arrangements 
primary objectives of these hedging transactions are to support the company s earnings targets and to protect earnings from falling commodity prices 
the company will target between and of the current year s production to be hedged at or above budget levels by the end of march in the current year 
the company will ladder in these hedges  to reach forward beyond the current year when price levels are attractive 
the volume of production hedged and the mix of derivative instruments employed are regularly evaluated and adjusted by management in response to changing market conditions and reviewed periodically by the board of directors 
additionally  under the terms of the market resources revolving credit facility  not more than of market resources production quantities can be committed to hedge arrangements 
the company does not enter into derivative arrangements for speculative purposes 
energy price risk management oil and natural gas prices fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand 
market resources bears a majority of the risk associated with commodity price changes and uses hedge arrangements in the normal course of business to limit the risk of adverse price movements 
however  these same arrangements usually limit future gains from favorable price movements 
market resources held hedge contracts covering the price exposure for about million dth of gas and million bbl of oil at december  a year earlier the contracts covered million dth of natural gas and million bbl of oil 
the hedging contracts exist for a significant share of equity gas and oil production and for a portion of gas marketing transactions 
the contracts at december   had terms extending through december  with about of those contracts expiring by the end of the undiscounted mark to market adjustment of financial gas and oil price hedging contracts at december  was a positive million 
a decline in gas and oil prices would add million to the mark to market calculation  while a increase in prices would deduct million 
the mark to market adjustment of gas and oil price hedging contracts at december  was a negative million 
a decline in gas and oil prices at that time would decrease the mark to market adjustment by million to million 
conversely  a increase in prices would have resulted in an million negative mark to market adjustment to a negative million balance at that date 
the calculations reflect energy prices posted on the nymex  various into the pipe postings  and fixed prices on the indicated dates 
these sensitivity calculations do not consider changes in the fair value of the corresponding scheduled physical transactions ie  the correlation between the index price and the price to be realized for the physical delivery of gas or oil production  which should largely offset the change in value of the hedge contracts 
also  the sensitivity measures exclude mark to market calculations on physical hedge contracts  where settlement is achieved through delivery of the gas or oil as opposed to cash settlements with a counterparty 
questar gas energy price risk management questar gas will continue to pursue hedging activities to mitigate energy price fluctuations for gas distribution customers 
the pscu has agreed that the benefits and the costs of hedging are to be included in the purchased gas adjustment account 
the stipulation allows questar gas to record mark to market adjustments for hedging contracts in the purchased gas adjustment account 
the pscw also allows the inclusion of hedging activities in the purchase gas adjustment account 
liquidity accelerators qmr has entered into commodity price hedging contracts with several counterparties 
the counterparties are banks and energy trading firms 
in some contracts the amount of credit allowed before qmr must post collateral for out of the money hedges varies depending on the credit rating of qmr s debt 
in cases where this arrangement exists  if qmr s credit ratings fall below investment grade bbb by standard poor s or baa by moody s counterparty credit generally falls to zero 
questar sold a parking lot in and as a condition of the sale  indemnified the buyer for parking rents  costs of restoration of the parking lot and disposal expenses required by any applicable government agency as the result of an environmental study  if contamination exists 
the drilling of several test holes  in a phase ii environmental study  did not locate any hazardous wastes or toxic substances in concentrations requiring remediation 
there are no financial limitations on questar s guaranty 
interest rate risk management the company owed million of long term debt at december   of which million was fixed rate debt 
the fair value of fixed rate debt is subject to change as interest rates fluctuate 
the fair value of questar s long term debt amounted to  million at december  the company owed million of long term debt at december   of which million was fixed rate debt 
the fair value of questar s long term debt amounted to million at december  the fair value calculation was based upon quoted market prices and the discounted present value of cash flows using the company s current borrowing rates 
if interest rates declined by  fair value would increase to  million in and million in and interest costs paid on variable rate long term debt would decrease about 
million 
the sensitivity calculations do not represent the cost to retire the debt securities 
the book value of variable rate debt approximates fair value 
securities available for sale securities available for sale represent equity instruments  primarily of communications and technology companies  traded on national exchanges 
the value of these investments is subject to day to day market volatility 
a change in prices would result in a change in value of million based on prices in and million in based on prices in a majority of the shares held by the company are trading near cost basis 
the sec has determined that trading below cost basis for two consecutive quarters constitutes an impairment that must be recognized in earnings 
foreign currency risk management the company does not hedge the foreign currency exposure of its foreign operation s net assets and long term debt 
long term debt held by the foreign operation amounting to million us is expected to be repaid from future operations of the foreign company
