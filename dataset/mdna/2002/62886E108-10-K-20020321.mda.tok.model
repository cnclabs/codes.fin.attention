the following table outlines our commitments at december  total less than over in millions amounts year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases non cancelable short term borrowings total contractual unused lines of credit standby letters of credit and surety bonds corporate guarantees other commitments total commerical includes unused bank overdraft and other uncommitted funds of million 
in  we entered into a million five year  unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions which was scheduled to mature in november in october  we terminated the million credit facility and entered into a million day unsecured revolving credit facility with a one year term out option and a million five year unsecured revolving credit facility  both with a syndicate of financial institutions 
the credit facilities contain certain representations and warranties  conditions  affirmative  negative and financial covenants  and events of default customary for such facilities 
interest rates charged on borrowings outstanding under the credit facilities are based on prevailing market rates 
no amounts were outstanding under the facilities at december   or we believe that cash flows from operations  the credit facilities existing or future arrangements and other short and long term debt financings  if any  will be sufficient to satisfy our future working capital  research and development  capital expenditures and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future 
our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations is dependent on general economic conditions  competitive pressures  and other business and risk factors described below in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations  or otherwise comply with the terms of our credit facilities  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or seek additional financing alternatives 
factors that may affect future results this annual report on form k  ncr s annual report to stockholders including the chairman s letter  and other documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission sec  as well as other oral or written statements we may make from time to time  contain information based on management s beliefs and include forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of that involve a number of known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
these forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance  and there are a number of factors including  but not limited to  those listed below  which could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from the results contemplated by such forward looking statements 
we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
competition our ability to compete effectively within the technology industry is critical to our future success 
we operate in the intensely competitive information technology industry 
this industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  price and cost reductions  and increasingly greater commoditization of products  making differentiation difficult 
in addition  this intense competition increases pressure on gross margins that could impact our business and operating results 
our competitors include other large  successful companies in the technology industry such as international business machines corporation ibm  oracle corporation  unisys corporation  diebold  inc and wincor nixdorf gmbh co  some of which have widespread penetration of their platforms and service offerings 
in addition  we compete with companies in niche markets such as advanced retail solutions and entry level atms 
if we are unable to compete successfully  the demand for our solutions  including products and services would decrease 
any reduction in demand could lead to fewer customer orders  a decrease in the prices of our products and services  reduced revenues  reduced margins  operating inefficiencies  reduced levels of profitability and loss of market share 
our future competitive performance depends on a number of factors  including our ability to rapidly and continually design  develop and market  or otherwise maintain and introduce solutions and related products and services for our customers that are competitive in the marketplace  offer a wide range of solutions from web enabled kiosks to enterprise data warehouses  offer solutions to customers that operate effectively within a computing environment which includes the integration of hardware and software from multiple vendors  offer products that are reliable and that ensure the security of data and information  offer high quality  high availability network services  market and sell all of our solutions effectively  and produce and deliver solutions at competitive operating margins 
introduction of new solutions the solutions we sell are very complex  and we need to rapidly and successfully develop and introduce new solutions 
we operate in a very competitive  rapidly changing environment  and our future success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new solutions that our customers choose to buy 
if we are unable to develop new solutions  our business and operating results would be impacted 
this includes our efforts to rapidly develop and introduce data warehousing software applications 
the development process for our complex solutions  including our software application development programs  requires high levels of innovation from both our developers and our suppliers of the components embedded in our solutions 
in addition  the development process can be lengthy and costly 
it requires us to commit a significant amount of resources to bring our business solutions to market 
if we are unable to anticipate our customers needs and technological trends accurately  or are otherwise unable to complete development efficiently  we would be unable to introduce new solutions into the market on a timely basis  if at all  and our business and operating results would be impacted 
in addition  if we are unable to successfully market and sell both existing and newly developed solutions  such as our self checkout technologies  electronic shelf labels and full function atms and outsourcing solutions  our operating results would be impacted 
our solutions  which contain both hardware and software products  may contain known as well as undetected errors which may be found after the products introduction and shipment 
while we attempt to remedy errors that we believe would be considered critical by our customers prior to shipment  we may not be able to detect or remedy all such errors  and this could result in lost revenues  delays in customer acceptance and incremental costs  which would all impact our operating results 
reliance on third parties third party suppliers provide important elements to our solutions 
we rely on many suppliers for necessary parts and components to complete our solutions 
in most cases  there are a number of vendors producing the parts and components that we utilize 
however  there are some components that are purchased from single sources due to price  quality  technology or other reasons 
for example  we depend on chips and microprocessors from intel corporation and operating systems from unix r and microsoft windows nt r 
certain parts and components used in the manufacture of our atms and the delivery of some of our retail store automation solutions are also supplied by single sources 
if we were unable to purchase the necessary parts and components from a particular vendor and we had to find an alternative supplier for such parts and components  our new and existing product shipments and solutions deliveries could be delayed  impacting our business and operating results 
we have  from time to time  formed alliances with third parties that have complementary products  services and skills 
many different relationships are formed by these alliances such as outsourcing arrangements to manufacture hardware and subcontract agreements with third parties to perform services and provide products to our customers in connection with our solutions 
these alliances introduce risks that we cannot control such as non performance by third parties and difficulties with or delays in integrating elements provided by third parties into our solutions 
the failure of third parties to provide high quality products or services that conform to the required specifications or contractual arrangements could impair the delivery of our solutions on a timely basis and impact our business and operating results 
acquisitions and alliances our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions or effectively manage alliance activities will help drive future growth 
as part of our overall solutions strategy  we intend to continue to make investments in companies  products  services and technologies  either through acquisitions  joint ventures or strategic alliances 
acquisitions and alliance activities inherently involve risks 
the risks we may encounter include those associated with assimilating and integrating different business operations  corporate cultures  personnel  infrastructures and technologies or products acquired or licensed  retaining key employees and the potential for unknown liabilities within the acquired or combined business 
the investment or alliance may also disrupt our ongoing business  or we may not be able to successfully incorporate acquired products  services or technologies into our solutions and maintain quality 
further  we may not achieve the projected synergies once we have integrated the business into our operations 
it is our policy not to discuss or comment upon negotiations regarding such business combinations or divestitures until a definitive agreement is signed or circumstances indicate a high degree of probability that a material transaction will be consummated  unless the law requires otherwise 
operating result fluctuations our revenues and operating results could fluctuate for a number of reasons 
future operating results could continue to be subject to fluctuations based on a variety of factors  including seasonality 
our sales are historically seasonal  with revenue higher in the fourth quarter of each year 
during the three quarters ending in march  june and september  we have historically experienced less favorable results than in the quarter ending in december 
such seasonality also causes our working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on the variability in the volume  timing and mix of product sales 
in addition  revenue in the third month of each quarter is typically higher than in the first and second months 
these factors  among other things  make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect our ability to predict financial results accurately 
acquisitions and alliances 
as part of our solutions strategy  we intend to continue to acquire technologies  products and businesses as well as form strategic alliances and joint ventures 
as these activities take place and we begin to include the financial results related to these investments  our operating results will fluctuate 
cost expense reductions 
we are actively working to manage our costs and expenses to continue to improve operating profitability without jeopardizing the quality of our products 
we are also striving to become the leading  low cost provider of certain financial self service and retail store automation solutions 
our success in achieving targeted cost and expense reductions depends on a number of factors  including our ability to achieve infrastructure rationalizations  implement six sigma r practices  improve accounts receivable collections  and reduce inventory overhead  among other things 
if we do not successfully complete our cost reduction initiatives  our results of operation or financial condition could be adversely affected 
multinational operations continuing to generate substantial revenues from our multinational operations helps to balance our risks and meet our strategic goals 
currently  approximately of our revenues come from our international operations 
we believe that our geographic diversity may help to mitigate some risks associated with geographic concentrations of operations eg  adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or business disruptions due to economic or political uncertainties 
however  our ability to sell our solutions domestically in the united states and internationally is subject to the following risks  among others general economic and political conditions in each country which could adversely affect demand for our solutions in these markets  as evidenced by the recent economic slowing in the us retail and global telecommunications industries  currency exchange rate fluctuations which could result in lower demand for our products as well as generate currency translation losses  changes to and compliance with a variety of local laws and regulations which may increase our cost of doing business in these markets or otherwise prevent us from effectively competing in these markets  and the impact of terrorist activity on the economy or markets in general  or on our ability  or that of our suppliers  to meet commitments  or on the timing of purchases by our customers 
employees hiring and retaining highly qualified employees helps us to achieve our business objectives 
our employees are vital to our success  and our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  sales  consulting and other key personnel is critical  as these key employees are difficult to replace 
if we are not able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future  our business and operating results could be impacted 
intellectual property as a technology company  our intellectual property portfolio is key to our future success 
our intellectual property portfolio is a key component of our ability to be a leading technology and services solutions provider 
to that end  we aggressively protect and work to enhance our proprietary rights in our intellectual property through patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  and if our efforts fail  our business could be impacted 
in addition  many of our offerings rely on technologies developed by others  and if we are not able to continue to obtain licenses for such technologies  our business would be impacted 
moreover  from time to time  we receive notices from third parties regarding patent and other intellectual property claims 
whether such claims are with or without merit  they may require significant resources to defend and  if an infringement claim is successful  in the event we are unable to license the infringed technology or to substitute similar non infringing technology  our business could be adversely affected 
environmental our historical and ongoing manufacturing activities subject us to environmental exposures 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party in connection with the fox river matter as further described in environmental matters under note of notes to consolidated financial statements  and we incorporate such discussion in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations by reference and make it a part of this risk factor 
contingencies like other technology companies  we face uncertainties with regard to regulations  lawsuits and other related matters 
we are subject to regulations  proceedings  lawsuits  claims and other matters  including those that relate to the environment  health and safety  and intellectual property 
such matters are subject to the resolution of many uncertainties  thus  outcomes are not predictable with assurance 
while we believe that amounts provided in our financial statements are currently adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities  there can be no assurances that the amounts required to discharge alleged liabilities from lawsuits  claims and other legal proceedings and environmental matters  and to comply with applicable environmental laws  will not impact future operating results 
key accounting policies revenue recognition we are a solutions company that provides our customers with hardware  software  professional consulting services and customer support services 
consistent with other companies that provide similar solution offerings  revenue recognition is often complex and subject to multiple accounting pronouncements including staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop and related interpretations 
we have described below our policy for revenue recognition which we believe is consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in general  we consider revenue realized  or realizable  and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the products or services have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for our solutions  hardware and software revenue is recognized upon shipment  delivery  installation or customer acceptance of the product  as defined in the customer contract 
revenue is not recognized until the customer has use of the products  including both the hardware and software components 
other than a few small software businesses we operate  which generate approximately of our annual revenue  we do not sell our software products without the related hardware as our software products are embedded in the hardware we sell 
our typical solution requires no significant production  modification or customization of the software or hardware that is essential to the functionality of the products other than installation for our more complex solutions 
for these complex solutions  revenue is deferred until the installation is complete 
as a solutions provider  our sales arrangements often include services in addition to hardware and software 
these services could include hardware maintenance  upgrade rights  customer support and professional consulting services 
for sales arrangements that include bundled hardware  software and services  we account for any undelivered service offering as a separate element of a multiple element arrangement 
these services are typically not essential to the functionality of the hardware and software 
revenue amounts deferred for services are determined based upon vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the elements as prescribed in sop for these services  revenue is typically recognized ratably over the period benefited or when the services are complete 
if the services are essential to the functionality of the hardware and software  revenue from the hardware and software components is deferred until the essential services are complete 
use of estimates as a result of our complex business  global scope and size  we are required to make significant estimates in preparing our financial statements 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  actual results could differ from the amounts estimated and recorded in such statements 
a description of each of our more significant estimates follows provisions for doubtful accounts 
we establish provisions for doubtful accounts using percentages of our accounts receivable balance as an overall proxy to reflect historical average credit losses and specifically provision for known issues 
given our experience  we believe that the reserves for potential losses are adequate  but if one or more of our larger customers were to default in its obligations under applicable contractual arrangements  we could be exposed to potentially significant losses in excess of the provisions established 
inventory reserves 
we maintain inventory at the lower of average cost or net realizable value 
excess and obsolete reserves are established based on forecasted usage  orders  technological obsolescence and inventory aging 
if our estimates related to forecasted usage are inaccurate  if orders are canceled or if changes in technology impact demand for our products in an unforeseen manner  we could be exposed to potentially significant losses in excess of the reserves established 
warranty reserves 
we accrue warranty reserves using percentages of revenue as an overall proxy to reflect our historical average warranty claims 
given our experience  we believe that the reserves for potential warranty claims are adequate  but if one or more of our larger customers were to make unexpected warranty claims  we could be exposed to potential losses in excess of the provisions established 
investments in marketable securities 
we classify our marketable securities as available for sale and account for them at fair value with net unrealized gains or losses reported  net of tax  within stockholders equity 
if a decline in the fair value of a marketable security is deemed by us to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the investment is written down to estimated fair value  and the amount of the write down is included in the determination of income 
if our estimates of fair value are inaccurate  we could be exposed to potentially significant losses up to the cost basis of the marketable equity securities 
long lived assets 
long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment  goodwill  software and investments are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
if our estimates about future undiscounted cash flows or useful lives were to change  we could be exposed to potentially significant losses 
pension  postemployment and postretirement 
we estimate the expected return on plan assets  discount rate  involuntary turnover rate  rate of compensation increase and future health care costs  among other things  and rely on actuarial estimates  to assess the future potential liability and funding requirements of our pension  postemployment and postretirement plans 
these estimates  if incorrect  could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
environmental and legal contingencies 
we accrue legal and environmental provisions when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount or range of the liability is reasonably estimable 
if we are able to determine that the amount of the liability is likely to fall into a range and no amount within that range can be determined to be the better estimate  we accrue at the minimum amount of the range 
our ultimate liability could be significantly greater than the amounts currently reserved for in the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
we estimate our tax liabilities based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which we operate 
our estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes  as well as judgments regarding the realization of deferred tax assets 
if our provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate  if we are unable to realize certain deferred tax assets or if the tax laws change unfavorably  we could experience potentially significant losses in excess of the established provisions 
likewise  if our provisions for current and deferred taxes are in excess of those eventually needed  if we are able to realize additional deferred tax assets or if tax laws change favorably  we could experience potentially significant gains see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
basis of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ncr and our majority owned subsidiaries 
long term investments in affiliated companies in which we own between and  and therefore exercise significant influence  but which we do not control  are accounted for using the equity method 
investments in which we do not exercise significant influence generally  when we have an investment of less than and no representation on the company s board of directors are accounted for using the cost method 
we eliminate all significant intercompany transactions and accounts 
we do not have any special purpose entities whose financial results are not included in the consolidated financial statements 
during the year  we did not participate in any material transactions with a related party  including members of the board of directors  executive officers  key employees or former employees

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  on january  sfas and sfas require that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction  and if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
for fair value hedge transactions in which we are hedging changes in the fair value of an asset  liability or firm commitment  changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument will be offset in the income statement by changes in the hedged item s fair value 
for cash flow hedge transactions in which we are hedging the variability of cash flows related to a variable rate asset  liability or a forecasted transaction  changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument will generally be reported in other comprehensive income 
the gains and losses on the derivative instrument that are reported in other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings in the periods in which earnings are impacted by the variability of the cash flows of the underlying hedged item 
to the extent that a qualifying hedge is terminated or ceases to be effective as a hedge  any deferred gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income to that point continue to be deferred and are included in the basis of the underlying transaction 
to the extent anticipated transactions are no longer likely to occur  the related hedges are closed with gains or losses recognized in earnings in the current period 
on january   we recorded net of tax  cumulative effect type losses of million and million  in accumulated other comprehensive income and net income  respectively  to recognize at fair value all derivative instruments that were designated as hedging instruments

 intangible assets  defines new accounting treatment for goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard eliminates the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives 
it establishes a requirement that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives be tested at least annually for impairment  provides specific guidance on such testing  and requires disclosures of information about goodwill and other intangible assets in the years subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   however  consistent with the requirements of the standard  goodwill and other intangible assets acquired after june  will be immediately subject to the new provisions 
in  we expect to recognize annual amortization expense savings of approximately million  of which less than million would have been recognized in other expense 
we are currently evaluating the goodwill asset under the sfas transitional impairment test and has not yet determined whether there will be an impairment loss 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as a change in accounting principle

the retirement obligations included within the scope of this project are those that an entity cannot avoid as a result of either acquisition  construction or normal operation of a long lived asset

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we use a variety of measures to monitor and manage these risks  including derivative financial instruments 
since a substantial portion of our operations and revenue occur outside the us  and in currencies other than the us dollar  our results can be significantly impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to manage our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates  we enter into various derivative financial instruments such as forward contracts and options 
these instruments generally mature within months 
at inception  select derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges of inventory purchases and sales  and of certain financing transactions that are firmly committed or forecasted 
gains and losses on qualifying cash flow hedge transactions are deferred and recognized in the determination of income when the underlying transactions are realized  canceled or otherwise terminated 
when hedging certain foreign currency transactions of a long term investment nature  gains and losses are recorded in the currency translation adjustment component of stockholders equity 
gains and losses on other foreign exchange contracts are recognized in other income or expense as exchange rates change 
for purposes of potential risk analysis  we use sensitivity analysis to quantify potential impacts that market rate changes may have on the fair values of our hedge portfolio related to firmly committed or forecasted transactions 
the sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the related gain or loss on the forecasted underlying transaction 
due to the adoption of sfas on january   the sensitivity data has been restated to conform to the presentation 
as of december  and  a appreciation in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies from the prevailing market rates would result in a million increase or a million increase in the fair value of the hedge portfolio  respectively 
conversely  a depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies from the prevailing market rates would result in a million decrease or an million decrease in the fair value of the hedge portfolio as of december  and  respectively 
the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities at december  was not material in relation to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we generally do not use derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments 
the only financial instruments that we utilize that are not exchange traded are foreign exchange forward contracts and options that we purchase exclusively from large financial institutions 
we record these contracts on our balance sheet at fair market value based upon market price quotations from the financial institutions 
accordingly  we do not enter into non exchange traded contracts that require the use of fair value estimation techniques  and that would have a material impact on our financial results 
we are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk on accounts receivable and financial instruments such as hedging instruments  short term investments  and cash and cash equivalents 
credit risk includes the risk of nonperformance by counterparties 
the maximum potential loss may exceed the amount recognized on the balance sheet 
exposure to credit risk is managed through credit approvals  credit limits  selecting major international financial institutions as counterparties to hedging transactions and monitoring procedures 
our business often involves large transactions with customers  and if one or more of those customers were to default in its obligations under applicable contractual arrangements  we could be exposed to potentially significant losses 
moreover  the recent downturn in the us economy could have an adverse impact on the ability of our customers to pay their obligations on a timely basis 
however  we believe that the reserves for potential losses are adequate 
at december  and  we did not have any major concentration of credit risk related to financial instruments
