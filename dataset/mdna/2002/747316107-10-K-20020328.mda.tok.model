item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates quaker s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon quaker s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires quaker to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  quaker evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer sales incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  property  plant  and equipment  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  restructuring  accrued incentive compensation plans  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
quaker bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
quaker believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements accounts receivable and inventory reserves and exposures quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of quaker s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
downturns in the overall economic climate may also tend to exacerbate specific customer financial issues 
a significant portion of quaker s revenues is derived from sales to customers in the us steel industry  where a number of bankruptcies occurred during recent years 
in and  quaker recorded additional provisions for doubtful accounts primarily related to bankruptcies in the us steel industry  including the december decision by ltv corporation  a major customer  to cease operations 
when a bankruptcy occurs  quaker must judge the amount of proceeds  if any  that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process 
as part of its terms of trade  quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and or may ship product on a consignment basis 
these practices may increase the company s exposure should a bankruptcy occur  and may require writedown or disposal of certain inventory due to its estimated obsolescence or limited marketability 
customer returns of products or disputes may also result in similar issues related to the realizability of recorded accounts receivable or returned inventory 
environmental and litigation reserves accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
accrued liabilities are exclusive of claims against third parties and are not discounted 
environmental costs and remediation costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life  increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of the property from the date acquired or constructed  and or mitigate or prevent contamination in the future 
estimates for accruals for environmental matters are based on a variety of potential technical solutions  governmental regulations and other factors  and are subject to a large range of potential costs for remediation and other actions 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in determining the most likely estimate within the range  and the factors determining this judgment may vary over time 
similarly  reserves for litigation and similar matters are based on a range of potential outcomes and require considerable judgment in determining the most probable outcome 
if no amount within the range is considered more probable than any other amount  the company accrues the lowest amount in the range in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
realizability of equity investments quaker holds equity investments in various domestic and foreign companies  whereby it has the ability to influence  but not control  the operations of the entity and its future results 
quaker records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions  poor operating results of underlying investments  or devaluation of foreign currencies could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value 
these factors may result in an impairment charge in the future 
tax exposures and valuation allowances quaker records expenses and liabilities for taxes based on estimates of amounts that will be ultimately determined to be deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions 
the filed tax returns are subject to audit  often several years subsequent to the date of the financial statements 
disputes or disagreements may arise during audits over the timing or validity of certain items or deductions  which may not be resolved for extended periods of time 
quaker establishes reserves for potential tax audit and other exposures as transactions occur and reviews these reserves on a regular basis  however  actual exposures and audit adjustments may vary from these estimates 
quaker also records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while quaker has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event quaker were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should quaker determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
restructuring reserves restructuring charges may consist of charges for employee severance  rationalization of manufacturing facilities and other items 
quaker records restructuring and other exit costs  including involuntary termination of certain employees  in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
certain of these items  particularly those involving impairment charges for assets to be sold or closed  require significant estimates and assumptions in terms of estimated sale proceeds  date of sale  transaction costs and other matters  and these estimates can change based on market conditions and other factors 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets consist of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from acquisitions which are being amortized on a straight line basis 
the realizability and period of benefit of goodwill is evaluated periodically to assess recoverability and  if necessary  impairment or adjustment of the period benefited would be recognized 
quaker is required to adopt statement of accounting standards sfas no

also  the sale of the us pulp and paper business in may unfavorably impacted the sales comparison by 
the shortfall for the year was mainly attributable to metalworking process chemicals sales declines in the us  europe  and asia pacific regions  primarily due to weak demand from the steel industry  as indicated by bankruptcy filings of two of the company s major us customers 
brazil sales increased in this segment on a local currency basis  but declined as well due to the weakening of the brazilian real against the us dollar 
these declines were partially offset by higher coatings segment revenues despite weakening aircraft production in the fourth quarter of sales from the company s new joint venture q technologies also helped offset the sales decline with its strong performance in sales of its sulfur removal technology to industrial customers 
operating income as reported was million in compared to million reported in excluding special items  operating income decreased to million in from million in the decline was primarily due to a lower gross profit margin related to the overall sales decline in gross profit as a percentage of sales also declined for compared to for primarily as a result of lower sales volumes and higher raw material costs in addition to product mix changes

excluding special items and adjusting for the us pulp and paper sale in  overall sg a costs declined compared to the decline in sg a is primarily due to continued cost containment efforts as well as foreign exchange impacts 
other income variance primarily reflects lower license fee revenue in in addition to gains on fixed asset disposals in versus losses in net interest expense was lower in reflecting increased interest income and lower overall short term borrowings in addition to lower interest rates in equity income was lower in compared to  reflecting lower income from the company s joint ventures in mexico  japan  and venezuela  as well as losses incurred by the venture 
minority interest was higher in  primarily due to higher net income from joint ventures in brazil and q technologies 
the company s effective tax rate was in both and the company has been assessed approximately million of additional taxes based on an audit of certain subsidiaries for prior years 
the company has initiated an appeal process related to this assessment and currently believes its reserves are adequate

comparison of with consolidated net sales for increased million over the sales growth was the net result of a increase in volume and a improvement in price mix  offset by a negative impact from foreign currency translation 
also  the sale of the us pulp and paper business in may unfavorably impacted the sales comparison by 
the improvement for the year was mainly attributable to metalworking process chemicals sales growth in brazil and the asia pacific region  primarily due to strong demand from the steel industry  offset by reductions in the european region due to foreign currency translation and lower coatings segment revenues 
coatings segment revenues declined as a result of lower aircraft production 
operating income as reported was million in compared to million reported in operating income decreased to million in from million excluding the impacts of the restructuring and integration credit adjustments in the decline was primarily due to a lower gross profit margin as a percentage of sales for compared to for 
this decrease is mainly a result of higher raw material costs 
selling  general  and administrative costs in decreased approximately million or from  reflecting the company s continued cost containment programs and a positive foreign exchange impact 
this decrease was offset by a million additional reserve for doubtful accounts related to two us steel customers that filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter minority interest was significantly higher in  primarily due to higher net income from joint ventures in brazil and china 
net interest expense was lower in reflecting increased interest income and lower overall short term borrowings 
other income variance reflects lower license revenue and gains on fixed asset disposals 
the company s effective tax rate in was compared with in the decrease in effective tax rate is primarily due to the implementation of several global tax planning initiatives  the most significant of which is related to the company s net operating loss carryforward position in brazil 
the impact of the tax planning initiatives in brazil is being magnified as these operations become more profitable

employee separation benefits under each plan varied depending on local regulations within certain foreign countries and included severance and other benefits 
as of december   quaker had completed of the planned employee separations under the plans 
quaker expects to substantially complete the initiatives contemplated under the restructuring plans by september  upon conclusion of its restructuring and other cost savings initiatives  quaker expects to achieve annualized savings of approximately million in cost of sales and operating expenses 
these estimated cost savings were calculated based upon expected cost reductions primarily related to employee separations as well as lower operating and depreciation expense resulting from factory rationalizations 
however  quaker cannot give any assurance whether the entire estimated cost savings will be realized 
components of accrued restructuring costs and amounts charged against the plans as of december  were as follows dollars in thousands currency restructuring asset translation december  charges impairment payments and other ending balance employee separations   facility rationalization    abandoned acquisitions total    in the fourth quarter of  the company announced and implemented a restructuring and integration plan to better align its organizational structure with market demands  improve operational performance  and reduce costs

at the end of  the company had substantially implemented these initiatives and reversed approximately  of the original charge 
the remaining restructuring and integration liability at december  of  was paid in january see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the liabilities for early pension and postemployment benefits are included in the company s pension and postretirement benefits obligations see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
environmental clean up activities the company is involved in environmental clean up activities and litigation in connection with an existing plant location and former waste disposal sites see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the second quarter of  it was discovered during an internal environmental audit that ac products  inc acp  a wholly owned subsidiary  had failed to properly report its air emissions 
in response  an internal investigation of all environmental  health  and safety matters at acp was conducted

in addition  acp is involved in certain soil and groundwater remediation activities identified in prior years 
in connection with these activities  the company recorded pre tax charges totaling million and million in and  respectively 
the company believes that the potential known liabilities associated with these matters range from approximately million to million  for which the company has sufficient reserves 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the company cannot be certain that liabilities in the form of remediation expenses  fines  penalties  and damages will not be incurred in excess of the amount reserved

forward looking and cautionary statements except for historical information and discussions  statements contained in this annual report may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties  and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such statements 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  significant increases in raw material costs  worldwide economic and political conditions  and foreign currency fluctuations that may affect worldwide results of operations 
furthermore  the company is subject to the same business cycles as those experienced by steel  automobile  aircraft  appliance  or durable goods manufacturers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quaker is exposed to the impact of interest rates  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in commodity prices  and credit risk 
interest rate risk 
quaker s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short and long term debt 
most of quaker s long term debt has a fixed interest rate  while its short term debt is negotiated at market rates which can be either fixed or variable 
accordingly  if interest rates rise significantly  the cost of short term debt to quaker will increase 
this can have a material adverse effect on quaker depending on the extent of quaker s short term borrowings 
as of december   quaker had  in short term borrowings 
foreign exchange risk 
a significant portion of quaker s revenues and earnings is generated by its foreign operations 
all such operations use the local currency as their functional currency 
accordingly  quaker s financial results are affected by risks typical of international business such as currency fluctuations  particularly between the us dollar  the brazilian real and the eu euro 
as exchange rates vary  quaker s results can be materially adversely affected 
in the past  quaker has used  on a limited basis  forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions and foreign exchange options to reduce exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates 
the amount of any gain or loss on these derivative financial instruments was immaterial  and there are no contracts or options outstanding at december  commodity price risk 
many of the raw materials used by quaker are commodity chemicals  and  therefore  quaker s earnings can be materially adversely affected by market changes in raw material prices 
in certain cases  quaker has entered into fixed price purchase contracts having a term of up to one year 
these contracts provide for protection to quaker if the price for the contracted raw materials rises  however  in certain limited circumstances  quaker will not realize the benefit if such prices decline 
quaker has not been  nor is it currently a party to  any derivative financial instrument relative to commodities 
credit risk 
quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of quaker s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
downturns in the overall economic climate may also tend to exacerbate specific customer financial issues 
a significant portion of quaker s revenues is derived from sales to customers in the us steel industry  where a number of bankruptcies occurred during recent years 
in and  quaker recorded additional provisions for doubtful accounts primarily related to bankruptcies in the us steel industry 
when a bankruptcy occurs  quaker must judge the amount of proceeds  if any  that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process 
as part of its terms of trade  quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and or may ship product on a consignment basis 
these practices may increase the company s exposure should a bankruptcy occur  and may require writedown or disposal of certain inventory due to its estimated obsolescence or limited marketability 
customer returns of products or disputes may also result in similar issues related to the realizability of recorded accounts receivable or returned inventory
