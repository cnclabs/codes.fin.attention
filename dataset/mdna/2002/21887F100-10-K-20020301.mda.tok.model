item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report and contains forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed in important factors that may affect our business  our results of operations and our stock price below 
overview our goal is to be a leader in the development and commercialization of products to prevent  treat or diagnose autoimmune diseases  cancer and infectious diseases 
our strategy consists of integrating our core antigen  monoclonal antibody  adjuvant  antigen delivery and tumor activated  or tap pro drug technologies into a strong product pipeline 
to implement this strategy  we develop select technologies and potential products ourselves and establish corporate collaborations for other select technologies at various stages in the research and development process  including partnerships for discovery  clinical development  manufacturing and marketing 
we believe that this development and partner driven approach will create significant scientific  operational and financial advantages and accelerate the commercial development of new therapeutic and prophylactic immunotherapeutic products 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our revenue resulted from collaborative agreements  and approximately  and  of our revenue resulted from funds awarded through government grants 
as of december   we had total stockholders equity of million 
we have entered into  and intend to continue to enter into  collaborative agreements at various stages in the research and development process 
we believe that this active corporate partnering strategy provides four distinct advantages it focuses on our fundamental strength in immunotherapeutic product discovery and selected product development  it capitalizes on our corporate partners strengths in product development  manufacturing and commercialization  it may enable us to retain significant downstream participation in product sales  and it reduces our financing requirements 
when entering into corporate partnering relationships  we seek to cover our research and development expenses through research funding  milestone payments  collaborative agreement credit lines  and technology and license fees 
we also endeavor to retain significant downstream participation in product sales through either profit sharing or product royalties paid on annual net sales 
we generate revenue from technology licenses  collaborative research and development arrangements  and cost reimbursement contracts 
revenue under technology licenses and collaborative agreements typically consists of nonrefundable and or guaranteed technology license fees  collaborative research funding  technology access fees  and various milestone and future product royalty or profit sharing payments 
we recognize revenue associated with up front license  technology access and research and development funding payments under collaborative agreements ratably over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research and development period 
revenue from substantive at risk milestones and future product royalties is recognized as earned based on the completion of the milestones and product sales  as defined in the respective agreements 
revenue under cost reimbursement contracts is recognized as the related costs are incurred 
payments received in advance of recognition as revenue are recorded as deferred revenue 
our material collaborative agreements include the following amersham health 
in october  we entered into an agreement whereby amersham health will market bexxar in europe 
we and amersham health will cooperate to register bexxar in 
table of contents europe 
we will be responsible for the generation of clinical trial data to support registration in europe 
amersham health will be responsible for manufacture and sale of bexxar in europe 
under the terms of a stock purchase agreement with amersham health  at our option  we may choose to sell up to million of additional shares of corixa common stock to amersham health at fair market value  which is determined according to the average of the closing prices of our common stock over a specified period surrounding the date of issuance 
upon execution of the agreement amersham health purchased  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  which represented a forty percent premium of approximately million to the then current market value of our common stock 
the premium has been accounted for as a nonrefundable license payment and was deferred and will be recognized as revenue ratably over the applicable term of the agreement  consistent with our revenue recognition policy 
in addition  amersham health will pay us multi million dollar milestone payments upon regulatory approval in europe as well as million dollar milestone payments based on achievement of certain sales volume targets 
amersham health will pay us royalties on all future product sales in europe 
amersham health has the right to terminate our agreement for corixa s material breach  insolvency  after october or if commercialization of bexxar in europe is blocked because another product is given orphan drug status or if the emea does not validate our maa because the emea determines that the maa is not sufficient

in addition  medicis has the right to terminate our agreement if we fail to meet development milestones as a result of force majuere 
medicis also has the right to terminate our supply agreement if we fail to supply two or more times in any five year period or three times during the term of the agreement or if  after a failure to supply  we cannot resume supply within months 
if medicis terminates our supply agreement for any of these reasons  our royalty from medicis would materially decease 
zenyaku kogyo has the right to terminate our agreement after receipt of the final report from our next pvac phase ii clinical trial  if we and zenyaku kogyo decide not to proceed with pvac phase iii clinical trials or after commercial launch of pvac  if pvac is not sufficiently profitable or the sale of pvac is barred by the japanese government 
zambon group and the pharmaceutical division of japan tobacco 
during may and june  we entered into corporate partnerships with zambon group  or zambon and the pharmaceutical division of japan tobacco  respectively  for the research  development and commercialization of vaccine products aimed at preventing and or treating lung cancer

infectious disease research institute 
in march  we entered into a research agreement with the idri  to research and develop ex vivo therapies for treating cancer 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  idri committed million of research funding over a three year term 
the agreement provides us with exclusive rights to all resulting intellectual property and product rights 
idri will receive a percentage of our proceeds related to ex vivo therapy products resulting from research and development funded by idri 
idri has the right to terminate our agreement upon our material default or insolvency or for any reason after march  glaxosmithkline 
during  we entered into a broad corporate partnership with gsk s wholly owned subsidiary  smithkline beecham plc  for vaccine discovery for breast  prostate  ovarian and colon cancer  tuberculosis vaccine discovery and development programs  and vaccine discovery programs for two chronic infectious pathogens  chlamydia trachomatis and chlamydia pneumoniae 
we also granted gsk an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture and sell vaccine products resulting from our clinical program based on her neu for treating breast and ovarian cancer  as well as our preclinical program based on mammaglobin  a novel gene product associated with breast cancer 
for certain of these disease areas  we granted gsk rights to develop  manufacture and sell passive immunotherapy products 
these products include t cell  dendritic cell and antibody therapeutics and therapeutic drug monitoring products 
gsk has committed million to fund work in these discovery programs during a four year research term  which is due to expire in september extended research and development programs beyond the initial four year term may be agreed upon by gsk and us 
gsk has the right to terminate our agreement for our material default or insolvency or for any reason after september an acquisition of corixa would constitute a material default of our agreement with gsk  entitling gsk to terminate the agreement 
we and our employees are precluded from working in any of the disease fields covered by our agreement with gsk for two years after the termination 
in addition  gsk purchased million of our common stock in at a premium to our fair market value 
under a collaborative agreement with gsk  we have an outstanding loan in the amount of million  which amount  together with all accrued unpaid interest is due on september  at gsk s option  gsk may choose to receive the outstanding principal and accrued unpaid interest in cash or shares of our common stock at an undisclosed premium to the then current fair market value of our common stock 
we have several license and supply agreements with gsk  granting gsk licenses to certain adjuvants for use in vaccines for infectious diseases  cancer and allergy that gsk is developing 
these agreements grant gsk exclusive and co exclusive license rights depending on the disease field and territory 
under the terms of the agreements  gsk pays annual license fees  milestones  transfer payments and future royalty payments 
as a result of our acquisition of coulter  we acquired the collaboration agreement between coulter and gsk s wholly owned subsidiary  smithkline beecham corporation  for developing and commercializing bexxar  which has completed phase iii clinical trials in the united states and is 
table of contents the subject of a bla currently under review by the fda  for treating non hodgkin s lymphoma  or nhl 
the agreement was amended in april to reduce gsk s territory under the agreement to the united states 
under the terms of the amended agreement  we and gsk will jointly market and sell bexxar in the united states following regulatory approval  and we and gsk will share profits and losses equally 
the agreement provides for the sharing of certain costs related to clinical and manufacturing development activities 
the agreement also provides for a million credit line  which was fully drawn in december terms and conditions of the credit line are discussed further in footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
under the terms of the agreement  gsk will reimburse us for certain development costs and pay us for the achievement of certain defined clinical development  regulatory and sales milestones 
in  we recognized milestone revenue of million upon institutional review board approval of two clinical protocols and million for the reimbursement of clinical and other development cost 
we and gsk will co market bexxar in the united states and will share revenue  cost of goods sold  sales and marketing costs and other costs associated with bexxar related activities 
currently  we share the pre launch cost of marketing associated with preparation of the potential commercialization of bexxar 
for  our share of these expenses was million and has been classified as sales  general and administrative expense 
amounts receivable from gsk at december  and were million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and of our revenue resulted from collaborative agreements with gsk 
we have acquired the following companies since coulter 
on december   we acquired coulter  a biopharmaceutical company engaged in developing novel drugs and therapies for treating cancer and autoimmune diseases 
we purchased coulter for approximately million  which consideration consisted of approximately  shares of our common stock valued at million  assumed coulter stock options valued at million  less million associated with the intrinsic value of unvested options  and transaction costs of approximately million 
the million was recorded as deferred compensation and is being amortized as compensation expense over the remaining vesting periods of up to four years 
as a result of the acquisition  we recorded an acquired in process research and development charge of million and acquisition related intangibles of million  which includes goodwill of million  an assumed lease arrangement of million and an assembled workforce of million 
the fda accepted the bla filing for coulter s lead product  bexxar  in november if we do not receive fda approval for bexxar  a significant portion of the value assigned to acquired in process research and development will not be realized and the value assigned to the intangible assets related to this acquisition will be impaired 
ribi 
on october   we completed the acquisition of ribi  a pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel agents that modulate the human immune response to prevent or treat certain diseases  including cancer  infectious diseases and cardiovascular injury 
we purchased ribi for approximately million  which consideration consisted of  shares of our common stock and stock options valued at million  cash of million paid by us to ribi for the redemption of ribi series a preferred stock and transaction costs of approximately million 
as a result of the acquisition  we recorded an in process research and development charge of million and acquisition related intangibles of million  which includes goodwill of million  adjuvant know how of million and assembled workforce of million 
anergen 
on february   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of anergen  a biotechnology company focused on treating autoimmune diseases through the discovery and development of proprietary therapeutics that selectively interrupt the disease process 
we purchased anergen for approximately million  which consideration consisted of  shares 
table of contents of our common stock with a market value of approximately million  approximately  in cash and approximately  in transaction costs 
we recorded an acquired in process research and development charge of million as a result of the acquisition 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million  of which million is attributable to the write off of acquired in process research and development costs associated with our acquisitions 
we may incur substantial additional operating losses over the next several years 
such losses have been and may continue to be principally the result of various costs associated with our discovery  research and development programs and the purchase of technology 
substantially all of our revenue to date has resulted from corporate partnerships  other research  development and licensing arrangements  and research grants 
our ability to achieve a consistent  profitable level of operations depends in large part on entering into corporate partnerships for product discovery  research  development and commercialization  obtaining regulatory approvals for our products and successfully manufacturing and marketing commercial products 
we may be unable to achieve consistent profitability 
in addition  payments under corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements are subject to significant fluctuations in both timing and amount 
therefore  our operating results for any period may fluctuate significantly and may not be comparable to the operating results for any other period 
results of operations fiscal years ended december   and revenue our revenue increased to million for  from million in and from million in revenue includes milestone payments of million  million and  in    respectively 
the increase is primarily the result of revenue recognized under collaborative agreements with gsk  medicis  purdue pharma and zenyaku kogyo 
the million milestone revenue in resulted from the achievement of certain clinical trial related milestones in connection with bexxar 
the increase  as compared with  resulted from revenue recognized from collaborative agreements with gsk  the pharmaceutical division of japan tobacco  medicis and purdue pharma 
the milestone revenue of million resulted from the completion of our initial phase i phase ii clinical trial related to anergix 
ra and acceptance of the investigational new drug ind application related to pvac for psoriasis 
the milestone revenue of  resulted from the approval of melacine in canada 
revenue under government grants and contracts in was million  up from million in and million in we expect revenue to fluctuate in the future depending on our ability to enter into new collaboration agreements  timing and amounts of payments under our existing collaboration agreements and our ability to commercialize our potential products 
effective january   we changed our method of accounting for nonrefundable up front license fees 
revenue for was recognized under our previous method of accounting 
see change in accounting principle below 
expenses research and development expenses our research and development expenses increased to million for  up from million in and from million in the increase was primarily the result of increased payroll and personnel expenses  legal fees  outside manufacturing  rent  outside services  consulting  lab supplies and travel due in part to our acquisition of coulter in december  as well as increased clinical and drug fees associated with bexxar and the expense of raw material purchased in anticipation of regulatory approval in in accordance with our accounting policy regarding research and development expenses  we do not capitalize such costs prior to product approval 
the increase compared with was primarily the result of increased payroll and personnel expenses attributable in part to our acquisitions  new technology acquisition expenses  increased clinical trial expenses related to pvac treatment  melacine and anergix and 
table of contents increased preclinical research activities 
we expect research and development expenses to increase or remain stable in the future as we continue to pursue our clinical and preclinical activities 
our research and development activities can be divided into research and preclinical programs and clinical development programs to treat autoimmune disease  cancer and infectious disease 
we estimate the costs associated with research and preclinical programs and clinical development programs approximate the following in millions research and preclinical programs clinical development programs total research and development because of the large number of research projects we have ongoing at any one time  and the ability to utilize resources across several projects  the majority of our research and development costs are not directly tied to any individual project and are allocated among multiple projects 
our project management is based primarily on scientific data and supplemented by these cost allocations  which are based primarily on human resource time incurred on each project 
the costs allocated to a project as a result do not necessarily reflect the actual costs of the project 
accordingly  we do not maintain actual cost incurred information for our projects on a project by project basis 
costs attributed to research and preclinical projects largely represent our pipeline generating activities 
costs associated with clinical development programs represent the advancement of these activities into project candidates 
the increase in our total research and development costs in compared to and represents the growth in our product pipeline  primarily due to our acquisition of coulter in december  and the advancement of existing programs from early stage research into preclinical and clinical development 
generally  the cost of a program increases as it advances from research to preclinical to clinical stage development 
most of our product development programs are at an early stage and may not result in any approved products 
product candidates that may appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
product candidates may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to pass through clinical trials than had been anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals and may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost and with acceptable quality 
furthermore  as part of our business strategy  we may enter into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates and it is uncertain which of our product candidates would be subject to future collaborative arrangements 
the participation of a collaborative partner may accelerate the time to completion and reduce the cost to us of a product candidate or it may delay the time and increase the cost to us due to the alteration of our existing strategy 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in the section of this report titled important factors that may affect our business  our results of operations and our stock price 
because of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully complete the development of our product candidates or the ultimate product development cost 
we recorded deferred compensation of million associated with the coulter acquisition in  which represents the value of the unearned options of coulter employees existing at the date of acquisition 
deferred compensation is being amortized over the remaining vesting period of the options 
we amortized million of deferred compensation to research and development expense in we expect deferred compensation expense to decrease in and future years due to employee termination  employee stock options vesting and the use of the multiple option approach for calculating deferred compensation 

table of contents sales  general and administrative expenses our sales  general and administrative expenses increased to million for  from million in and from million in the increase was primarily the result of increased payroll and personnel expenses attributable to our acquisition of coulter in december  specifically as it relates to the acquired sales and marketing functions and legal fees 
we have also recognized expense of million for our portion of the pre launch marketing costs associated with bexxar 
we expect sales  general and administrative expenses to increase in the future to support the expansion of our business activities as we expand our sales and marketing capabilities 
we amortized million of deferred compensation to sales  general and administrative expense in we expect deferred compensation expense to decrease in and future years due to employee termination  employee stock options vesting and the use of the multiple option approach for calculating deferred compensation 
amortization our intangible amortization increased to million for  from million in and  in the intangible amortization for consisted of million associated with the coulter acquisition and million associated with the ribi acquisition 
in july the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  which requires use of a nonamortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles  effective january  under this nonamortization approach  goodwill and certain intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead will be reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its fair value 
assembled workforce will be reclassified to goodwill in accordance with the statement and will be evaluated accordingly 
we will continue to amortize the acquired lease and adjuvant know how over their estimated remaining useful life 
we expect adoption of this accounting standard to substantially reduce our amortization of goodwill and intangibles commencing january  acquired in process research and development for  acquired in process research and development ipr d expense was zero compared to million in and million in the million reflects the amount allocated to ipr d that we acquired in the coulter acquisition compared with million in the ribi and anergen acquisitions in acquired ipr d for each of the above acquisitions represents the present value of the estimated after tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased technology  which  at the acquisition dates  had not yet reached technological feasibility 
the cash flow projections for revenues were based on estimates of growth rates and the aggregate size of the respective markets for each product  probability of technical success given the stage of development at the time of acquisition  royalty rates based on prior licensing agreements  product sales cycles  and the estimated life of a product s underlying technology 
estimated operating expenses and income taxes were deducted from estimated revenue projections to arrive at estimated after tax cash flows 
projected operating expenses include general and administrative expenses  and research and development costs 
the rate utilized to discount projected cash flows ranged from to for in process technologies and was based primarily on venture capital rates of return and the weighted average cost of capital for us at the time of acquisition 
at the acquisition date  coulter s ipr d projects consisted of bexxar  a radioisotope  iodine  or i  combined with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes and binds to the cd antigen  an antigen commonly expressed on the surface of b cells primarily during that stage of their life cycle when nhl arises  g  a monoclonal antibody that binds to sub unit one of the type i interferon receptor and neutralizes the activity of all type i interferons and may provide therapeutic benefit in a number of autoimmune diseases  including rheumatoid arthritis  systemic lupus erythematosus  crohn s disease  graft versus host disease and 
table of contents solid organ transplantation rejection and cpi  a tumor activated peptide  or tap  a proprietary molecule based on a peptide of four amino acids that is linked to doxorubicin 
cpi is designed to deliver significantly higher levels of doxorubicin to a tumor site relative to normal tissues 
doxorubicin  is an off patent chemotherapeutic drug that currently is used in treating a number of solid tumor cancers 
at the acquisition date  ribi s ipr d projects consisted of mpl  an adjuvant immunostimulant for potential application in improving the efficacy of a variety of vaccines that are at various stages of preclinical and clinical development  rc  a next generation synthetic adjuvant  melacine  a therapeutic vaccine to treat melanoma  enhanzyn tm  which is being developed by biomira for use in melacine vaccine and in theratope  as a therapeutic vaccine for breast  lung  gastrointestinal and colon cancer  and rc  a synthetic compound that is being developed for use in protecting against reperfusion injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgery or angioplasty 
in november  we received approval of melacine for treating stage iv malignant melanoma in canada 
in march  we also received data from us phase iii clinical trials for melacine for treating stage ii and stage iv malignant melanoma 
on january   we received notification from the fda that the oncologic drugs advisory committee  or odac  will discuss appropriate study design and control for a proposed second phase iii trial of melacine on february  at the acquisition date  anergen s ipr d projects were potential therapies for treating autoimmune diseases that focus on destroying or inactivating t cells without affecting the protective functions of the immune system and or stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies that may interfere with the presentation of auto antigens to destructive t cells 
anergix 
ra  under development in partnership with organon  is the most advanced product 
anergix 
ra is a soluble version of the human leucocyte antigen hla class ii containing an autoantigenic peptide known to interact with t cells involved in the development of arthritis 
anergix 
ra is designed to inactivate t cells responsible for developing arthritic lesions 
anergix 
ra completed a randomized  double blinded  controlled phase i ii clinical trial in anervax 
ra is a synthetic peptide vaccine consisting of a small portion of the hla class ii molecule 
anervax 
ra has completed a patient randomized phase ii double blinded clinical trial 
we continue to evaluate future opportunities for anervax 
ra 
we are reformulating this peptide vaccine to incorporate our novel adjuvant technology and are seeking to partner this program before entering into additional clinical trials 
we based all of the estimates and projections related to the ipr d projects for coulter  ribi  and anergen on assumptions we believed to be reasonable at the time of each acquisition but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
if we do not successfully develop these projects  our business  operating results  and financial condition may be adversely affected 
as of the date of each acquisition  we concluded that once completed  the technologies under development can only be economically used for their specific and intended purposes and that such in process technologies have no alternative future use after taking into consideration the overall objectives of the project  progress toward the objectives  and uniqueness of developments to these objectives 
if the projects fail  the economic contribution expected to be made by the in process research and development will not materialize 
the risk of untimely completion includes the risk that competitors will develop alternative products 
interest income our interest income increased to million for  from million in and from million in the change in interest income is based on increased average investment balances during the year 
interest expense our interest expense increased to million for the year ended december   from  for the same period in and from  in the increase was primarily attributable to higher loan and capital lease financing balances 

table of contents other income our other income was million for compared with  in and  in the increase in other income for is primarily attributable to a gain of million on the sale of our investment in abgenix 
other income for includes a gain of  on the partial sale of our investment in abgenix and  in sublease rental receipts 
other income for includes  and  in proceeds from the recovery of a collaboration receivable that was previously charged to expense and sublease rental receipts  respectively 
change in accounting principle effective january   we changed our method of accounting for nonrefundable up front license fees to recognize such fees over the term of the related research and development collaboration arrangement on a straight line basis  as this method best matches the effort provided 
the million cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  calculated as of january   was reported as a charge in the year ended december  the cumulative effect was initially recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized as revenue over the remaining term of the research and development collaboration agreements 
for the year ended december   the impact of the change in accounting was to increase net loss by million  or per share  comprised of the million cumulative effect of the change as described above per share less million of the deferred revenue related to the cumulative effect adjustment that was recognized as revenue during the year per share 
had the change in accounting been in effect retroactively as of january   net loss for the year ended december  would have been million  or per share 
revenue for both and includes million of revenue previously recognized and included in the cumulative effect adjustment 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through funding from collaborative agreements and the issuance of equity securities and debt instruments 
for the previous three years  we have received cash of approximately million from collaborative research agreements and grants  million from the issuance of series a and series b preferred stock under an equity line of credit and million from a bank loan 
during  and we received total research and development funding of million under our vaccine discovery collaboration with gsk 
we will receive million under this agreement in prior to the expiration of the research term on august  we will continue to develop certain technologies related to these vaccine programs 
as of december   future funding under terms of our existing agreements is approximately million excluding milestone payments  which are contingent upon the success of the research 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale 
working capital decreased to million at december  from million in at december   noncurrent securities available for sale includes certificate of deposits of million that secure a financing agreement and million that secure letters of credit related to our leased properties 
the following are contractual commitments at december  associated with debt obligations  lease obligations and credit lines in thousands payments due by period contractual commitment total year years years thereafter long term obligations capital lease obligations operating leases bi pharma other total contractual commitments 
table of contents we are also required to pay dividends on our preferred stock 
the dividend can be paid in cash or common stock  at our option 
the maximum amount of cash that would be paid in a year would be million and the maximum number of shares of common stock that would be issued is  during  we used million of cash in our operations  compared with million in and million in this increase in cash used in operations is due to increased research and development activities and the addition of sales and marketing functions 
our investing activities provided cash of million in  compared with cash used of million in and million in the increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to the sale of available for sale securities 
our financing activities provided cash of million in compared with million in and million in cash received from financing activities decreased in due primarily to proceeds of million from our follow on public offering of common stock and our issuance of series b preferred stock of that did not occur in under our equity line facility with cmi  we may  subject to certain conditions  sell to cmi up to million of our common stock from time to time over a period of two years beginning december  the number of shares and price per share will depend on the market price and trading volume of the shares during the applicable one to twenty day draw down period for any sale 
although we may have funds available under the cmi equity line facility after the registration statement with respect to the facility is declared effective by the sec  cmi is not obligated to purchase shares of our common stock unless a number of conditions have been satisfied 
first  it generally has no obligation to purchase shares to the extent that the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the specified valuation period following the exercise of our right to sell shares to cmi under the equity line facility is below per share 
there can be no assurance that the price of our common stock will meet this minimum trading price condition to enable us to draw down funds under the equity line facility 
second  cmi is only obligated at any given request to purchase shares in a minimum aggregate amount of  and in a maximum aggregate amount of million 
furthermore  cmi has no obligation to purchase shares on a given day if our daily trading volume falls below a specified minimum 
finally  on trading days where the common stock is not listed and approved for trading on the principal trading exchange of our common stock or where trading is restricted  we might not have the right to sell any shares to cmi 
for  and  we invested million  million and million  respectively  in property and equipment 
we believe that our existing capital resources  committed payments under our existing corporate partnerships  bank credit agreements  the cmi equity line facility  equipment financing and interest income will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations over at least the next months 
however  a substantial number of the payments to be made by our corporate partners and other licensors depend on us achieving development and regulatory milestones 
failure to achieve these milestones may reduce the period which we are able to fund operations without additional capital resources 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  among others continued scientific progress in our discovery  research and product development programs  progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  the magnitude and scope of our discovery  research and development programs  our ability to maintain existing  and establish additional  corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the time and costs involved in expanding and maintaining our manufacturing facilities  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims  the potential need to develop  acquire or license new technologies and products  and 
table of contents other factors not within our control 
we are currently negotiating to obtain a lease financing in the amount of approximately million to be secured by lab equipment 
in addition  we intend to seek additional funding through corporate partnerships  and also may seek additional funding through public or private equity financings  which could result in significant dilution to our stockholders  public or private debt financings  and additional capital lease transactions 
however  additional financing may be unavailable on acceptable terms  if at all 
if sufficient capital is not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  eliminate or divest one or more of our discovery  research  preclinical or clinical programs or manufacturing efforts

the fasb s new rules on asset impairment supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and provide a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we will evaluate the implementation of the impairment rules  if any on the earnings and financial position of the company 
recent developments although we have been preparing for a february panel review of the safety and efficacy of bexxar  the fda has advised us that review of bexxar by odac will not occur at its february meeting 
as a result of the extensive amount of material that we submitted in response to the complete review letter we received on march   and our subsequent discussions with the fda  the fda has concluded that odac would not be prepared to review bexxar in february the next odac meeting is tentatively scheduled for june  although we can provide no assurances  we are hopeful that the safety and efficacy of bexxar will be reviewed at the next odac meeting 
market risk disclosures interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt 
all of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available for sale and  accordingly  are presented at fair value on our balance sheets 
we generally invest our excess cash in a rated or higher short to intermediate term fixed income securities and money market mutual funds 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates  
table of contents and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
at december   we had long term obligations outstanding of approximately million 
our payment commitments associated with these debt instruments are fixed during the corresponding terms and are comprised of interest payments  principal payments  or a combination thereof 
the market value of our long term debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates  increasing in periods of declining rates of interest  and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest 
the table below summarizes the estimated effects on certain assets and liabilities based on hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates 
it is assumed the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks 
significant variations in market interest rates could produce changes in the timing of repayments due to available prepayment options 
the fair value of such instruments could be affected and  therefore  actual results might differ from those reflected in the following table estimated hypothetical fair value after hypothetical change in hypothetical percentage fair value at interest rate change in decrease in december  bp basis points interest rate stockholders equity in thousands assets us government agencies and corporate obligations  bp decrease  bp increase  bp increase  bp increase  liabilities long term obligations  bp decrease  bp increase  bp increase  bp increase  less than important factors that may affect our business  our results of operations and our stock price 
we are at an early stage of development and may be unable to successfully commercialize our product candidates 
we are at an early stage in the development of the majority of our therapeutic  prophylactic and diagnostic product candidates 
the development of safe and effective therapies for treating people with autoimmune diseases  cancer or infectious diseases is highly uncertain and subject to numerous risks 
product candidates that may appear to be promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
product candidates may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to progress through clinical trials than had been anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost and with acceptable quality or may fail to achieve market acceptance 
we have not commercialized any products  other than melacine  which is approved for sale in canada  and an immunotherapeutic product that has been approved on a named patient basis in germany  which product incorporates our mpl adjuvant  our proprietary adjuvant added to the product to heighten the immune response to the antigens in the product 
we receive payments from schering plough limited for supply of melacine for commercial sale 
the fda has up to six months from september   to provide a regulatory decision on our most advanced product candidate  bexxar 
however  we may not be 
table of contents successful in obtaining regulatory approval for bexxar or any of our other product candidates  or in commercializing these product candidates if approval is obtained 
our product candidates are subject to a government regulatory approval process that is uncertain  time consuming and expensive and may not result in any approved products 
any products that we develop are subject to regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities in the united states  including the fda  and by similar agencies in other countries 
any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances before it may be marketed in a particular country 
the regulatory process  which includes extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials of each product candidate in order to study its safety and efficacy  is uncertain  can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
clinical trials of our product candidates may not demonstrate safety and efficacy to the extent necessary to obtain regulatory approvals for the indications being studied  if at all 
companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after obtaining promising results in earlier trials 
the failure to demonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of any of the product candidates by us could delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product candidate 
the timing and completion of current and planned clinical trials of our product candidates depend on  among other factors  the rate at which patients are enrolled  which is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to the clinical sites  the number of clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the study  and the existence of competing clinical trials 
delays in patient enrollment in clinical trials may occur  which may result in increased costs  program delays or both 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
data from a phase iii clinical trial of melacine  our melanoma vaccine  with the primary endpoint being the comparison of disease free survival between patients with stage ii melanoma who  following surgical removal  received melacine vaccine versus observation only  showed no statistically significant difference in disease free survival of the eligible patient population 
recent discussions with the fda regarding the outcome of this trial have determined that approval of melacine in the united states will require an additional clinical trial 
we may not perform an additional trial and  even if we do  melacine may not be approved by the fda 
in addition  we may encounter delays or the fda may reject our product candidates  based on changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development  extension of the period of review of any application for regulatory approval or other factors beyond our control 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals would adversely affect the marketing of any products we develop  could impose significant additional costs on us  would diminish any competitive advantages that we may attain  and could adversely affect our ability to receive royalties and generate revenues and profits 
for example  we filed a bla for bexxar in june in august  the fda sent us a refusal to file letter 
we resubmitted the bexxar bla in september and in march we received a complete review letter from the fda following the agency s six month review of the bexxar bla 
in response to the complete review letter  on september   we submitted additional clinical and manufacturing 
table of contents information 
as a result of the extensive amount of material that we submitted and our subsequent discussions with the fda  the fda has concluded that odac would not be prepared to review bexxar at its february meeting 
the next odac meeting is tentatively scheduled for june the fda may conclude  however  that it needs additional time to review the materials that we submitted in response to the complete review letter which would further delay fda review of bexxar 
regulatory approval  if granted  may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which the approved product may be marketed 
these limitations could reduce the size of the potential market for the product 
product approvals  once granted  may be withdrawn if problems occur after initial marketing 
further  manufacturers of approved products are subject to ongoing regulation  including compliance with fda regulations governing gmp 
failure to comply with manufacturing regulations can result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to renew marketing applications and criminal prosecution 
we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market  which could harm sales of the affected products 
if we or others identify side effects after any of our products are on the market  or if manufacturing problems occur  regulatory approval may be withdrawn  reformulation of our products  additional clinical trials  changes in labeling of our products or changes to or re approvals of our manufacturing facilities may be required  sales of the affected products may drop significantly  our reputation in the marketplace may suffer  and lawsuits  including class action suits  may be brought against us 
any of the above occurrences could harm or prevent sales of the affected products or could increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing these products 
acceptance of bexxar in the marketplace is uncertain and failure to achieve market acceptance will limit our potential revenue from sales of bexxar 
if our most advanced product candidate  bexxar  is approved  it would represent a significant departure from currently approved methods of treatment for non hodgkin s lymphoma  or nhl  because it would require medical personnel to handle radioactive materials 
as with any new drug  doctors may be inclined to continue to treat nhl patients with conventional therapies  in this case chemotherapy and biologics 
further  oncologists and hematologists are not typically licensed to administer radioimmunotherapies such as bexxar and will need to engage a nuclear medicine physician or receive specialty training to administer bexxar 
nuclear regulatory commission regulations permit bexxar to be administered on an outpatient basis in most cases that we currently contemplate 
however  market acceptance could be adversely affected to the extent hospitals are required under applicable state  local or individual hospital regulations to administer the therapeutic dose of bexxar on an in patient basis 
because we have limited sources of revenue  our results of operations are uncertain and may fluctuate significantly  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease 
to date  almost all of our revenue has resulted from payments made under agreements with our corporate partners  and we expect that most of our revenue will continue to result from corporate partnerships until approval and commercialization of significant products 
payments under corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements are subject to significant fluctuations in both timing and amount 
we may not receive anticipated revenue under existing corporate partnerships  and we may be unable to enter into any additional corporate partnerships 

table of contents since our inception  we have generated only minimal revenue from diagnostic product sales and no significant revenue from therapeutic or prophylactic product sales 
with the exception of mpl adjuvant  which has been approved for sale on a named patient basis in germany  and melacine  which is available for sale in canada  we cannot predict when  if ever  our research and development programs will result in commercially available immunotherapeutic products 
we do not know when  if ever  we will receive any significant revenue from commercial sales of these products 
as a result of our limited sources of revenue  our results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate 
because of these fluctuations  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful 
in addition  our results of operations for a particular quarter or year may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could result in a decrease in our stock price 
we expect to incur future operating losses and may never achieve profitability 
we have experienced significant operating losses in each year since our inception on september  as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million  of which million is attributable to the write off of in process research and development costs associated with the acquisitions of four companies 
we may incur substantial additional operating losses over at least the next several years 
these losses have been and may continue to be principally the result of the various costs associated with our acquisition activities  including the expenses associated with the write off of in process research and development  research and development programs  preclinical studies and clinical activities 
we may never achieve profitability  and our ability to achieve a consistent  profitable level of operations depends in large part on our entering into agreements with corporate partners for product discovery  research  development and commercialization  obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates  and successfully manufacturing and marketing our products once they are approved for sale 
even if we are successful in the above activities  our operations may not be profitable 
we will need additional capital and our ability to implement our existing financing plans and secure additional funding is uncertain 
we may be unable to raise on acceptable terms  if at all  the substantial capital resources necessary to conduct our operations 
if we are unable to raise the required capital  we may be forced to limit some or all of our research and development programs and related operations  curtail commercialization of our product candidates and  ultimately  cease operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in our discovery and research programs  progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  the magnitude and scope of our discovery  research and development programs  our ability to maintain existing  and establish additional  corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the time and costs involved in expanding and maintaining our manufacturing facilities  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims  the potential need to develop  acquire or license new technologies and products  and other factors beyond our control 

table of contents although we may have funds available under the cmi equity line facility  cmi is not obligated to purchase shares of our common stock unless a number of conditions have been satisfied 
first  it generally has no obligation to purchase shares to the extent that the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the specified valuation period following the exercise of our right to sell shares to cmi under the equity line facility is below per share 
there can be no assurance that the price of our common stock will meet this minimum trading price condition to enable us to draw down funds under the equity line facility 
second  cmi is only obligated at any given request to purchase shares in a minimum aggregate amount of  and in a maximum aggregate amount of million 
furthermore  cmi has no obligation to purchase shares on a given day if our daily trading volume falls below a specified minimum 
finally  on trading days where the common stock is not listed and approved for trading on the principal trading exchange of our common stock or where trading is restricted  we might not have the right to sell any shares to cmi 
in addition to any funds available under the cmi equity line facility  we intend to seek additional funding through corporate partnerships  and also may seek additional funding through public or private equity financings  which could result in significant dilution to our stockholders  public or private debt financings  and capital lease transactions 
we believe that our existing capital resources  committed payments under existing corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  bank credit arrangements  the cmi equity line facility  equipment financing and interest income will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations over at least the next months 
however  a substantial number of the payments to be made by our corporate partners and other licensors depend on us achieving development and regulatory milestones 
failure to achieve these milestones may reduce the period during which we will be able to fund operations without additional capital resources 
if our corporate partnerships are unsuccessful or if we are unable to establish corporate partnerships in the future  our revenue growth and product development may be limited 
the success of our business strategy largely depends on our ability to enter into multiple corporate partnerships and to manage effectively the numerous relationships that may result from this strategy 
we derived  and of our revenue for the years ended december   and from research and development and other funding under our existing corporate partnerships 
we have established relationships with various corporate partners  including medicis pharmaceutical corporation  glaxosmithkline biologicals  sa  a subsidiary of glaxosmithkline plc  japan tobacco  inc  inpharzam international sa  a wholly owned subsidiary of zambon group  spa  zenyaku kogyo co  ltd  schering corporation  schering plough  ltd  nv organon  and wyeth lederle  among others 
the process of establishing corporate partnerships is difficult and time consuming 
our discussions with potential partners may not lead to the establishment of new corporate partnerships on favorable terms  if at all 
if we successfully establish new corporate partnerships  such partnerships may never result in the successful development of our product candidates or the generation of significant revenue 
management of our relationships with our corporate partners requires significant time and effort from our management team  coordination of our research with the research priorities of our corporate partners  effective allocation of our resources to multiple projects  and an ability to attract and retain key management  scientific and other personnel 
some of our corporate partners have options to license aspects of our technology 
any of these corporate partners may not exercise its option to license this technology 
we have also entered into corporate partnerships with several companies for the development  commercialization and sale of diagnostic products 
table of contents incorporating our proprietary antigen technology 
these diagnostic corporate partnerships may never generate significant revenue 
because we generally enter into research and development collaborations with corporate partners at an early stage of product development  our success largely depends on the performance of our corporate partners 
we do not directly control the amount or timing of resources devoted by our corporate partners to collaborative activities 
our corporate partners may not commit sufficient resources to our research and development programs or the commercialization of our products and product candidates 
if any corporate partner fails to commit sufficient resources  our preclinical or clinical development related to the corporate partnership could be delayed or terminated 
also  our current corporate partners or future corporate partners  if any  may pursue existing or other development stage products or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us 
finally  our corporate partners may terminate any of our current partnerships  and we may be unable to establish additional corporate partnerships in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
our inability to license technology from third parties or our inability to maintain exclusive licenses may impair our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
our success also depends on our ability to enter into and maintain licensing arrangements with commercial or academic entities to obtain technology that is advantageous or necessary to developing and commercializing our product candidates 
if we cannot obtain or maintain licenses to technologies advantageous or necessary to develop and commercialize our product candidates  we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or in license similar technology 
if we are unable to do so  we may be prevented from commercializing our product candidates 
we currently have various license agreements that provide us rights to use technologies owned or licensed by third parties in research  development and commercialization activities 
many of these agreements contain milestone based termination provisions  in which case our failure to meet any agreed milestones may allow the licensor to terminate an agreement 
in addition  some of these agreements grant us exclusive licenses to the underlying technologies 
if we are unable to maintain the exclusivity of our exclusive licenses  our competitive position may be harmed 
further  we may be unable to negotiate additional license agreements in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to protect and enforce our patent rights  we may be unable to effectively protect or exploit our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain  protect and enforce commercially valuable patents 
if we fail to obtain and maintain patent protection for our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements  our competitors could develop and commercialize products that would otherwise infringe on our patents 
we try to protect our proprietary positions by filing us and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements that are important to developing our business 
our patent position is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions 
legal standards relating to the validity and scope of claims in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical fields are still evolving 
accordingly  the degree of future protection for our patent rights is uncertain 
the risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our patents include the following the pending patent applications we have filed or to which we have exclusive rights may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents  the claims of any patents that issue may not provide meaningful protection  we may be unable to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable  the patents licensed or issued to us may not provide a competitive advantage  other companies may challenge patents licensed or issued to us  
table of contents disputes may arise regarding the invention and corresponding ownership rights in inventions and know how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us  our licensors  corporate partners and other scientific collaborators  and other companies may design around our patented technologies 
we have licensed several patent applications from southern research institute  or sri  related to our microsphere encapsulation technology 
two of these patent applications are currently the subject of opposition proceedings before the european patent office 
in one of the oppositions  the european patent office has revoked a previously issued european patent 
although sri has appealed this decision  it is uncertain whether sri will prevail in this or any other opposition proceeding 
as a result  these patents may not issue in europe 
idec has challenged the validity of several of our patents related to bexxar by seeking declaratory judgment of invalidity of these patents 
idec is also seeking a declaratory judgment that its zevalin product for the treatment of non hodgkin s lymphoma is not infringing the patents 
we  gsk  our collaboration partner for bexxar  and the regents of the university of michigan  our licensor of the patents at issue  have filed a lawsuit against idec alleging patent infringement of certain of our patents by zevalin and seeking monetary damages and permanent injunctive relief 
claims in the patents at issue in the litigation cover imaging  composition of matter and methods of use in the treatment of non hodgkin s lymphoma 
if idec is successful in these proceedings  idec would be able to market its zevalin product  without the need to license from us any of our patents 
if we are unable to gain access to patent and proprietary rights of others  we may be unable to compete effectively 
our success depends in part on our ability to gain access to third party patent and proprietary rights and to operate our business without infringing on third party patent rights 
we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from third parties to develop  manufacture and commercialize our product candidates 
licenses required under third party patents or proprietary rights may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we do not obtain the required licenses  we could encounter delays in product development while we attempt to redesign products or methods or we could be unable to develop  manufacture or sell products requiring these licenses at all 
if we are unable to protect our trade secrets  we may be unable to protect our interests in proprietary know how that is not patentable or for which patents are difficult to enforce 
our success depends in part on our ability to protect trade secrets that are not patentable or for which patents are difficult to enforce 
to protect our proprietary rights  we rely primarily on confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties  and protective contractual provisions such as those contained in license agreements and research agreements 
nevertheless  other companies may develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate our technologies that are not protected by patents or otherwise obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
other parties may breach confidentiality agreements and other protective contracts we have entered into  and we may not become aware of  or have adequate remedies in the event of  any breach 
any material leak of confidential data into the public domain or to third parties could harm our competitive position 
if we are unable to protect our trademarks  we may be unable to compete effectively 
we try to protect our trademarks by filing for us and foreign registrations for marks that are important to developing our business 
however  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  and effective trademark protection may not be available in other jurisdictions 
if we are unable to protect our trademarks  we may be unable to establish brand awareness for our products  which could limit our ability to compete effectively 
our registered trademarks  mpl and melacine  are currently the subjects of opposition proceedings before the office for the harmonization in the internal market  which handles initial prosecution and opposition of european 
table of contents trademarks 
we may not ultimately prevail in these opposition proceedings 
as a result  we may not receive trademark protection for mpl or melacine in europe 
litigation regarding intellectual property rights owned or used by us may be costly and time consuming 
as a result of litigation  interferences  opposition proceedings and other administrative proceedings in which we are or may become involved  including the idec litigation  we may incur substantial expense and the proceedings may divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination may subject us to significant liabilities  allow our competitors to market competitive products without obtaining a license from us  or require us to seek licenses from third parties that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we cannot obtain such licenses  we may be restricted or prevented from developing and commercializing our product candidates 
the enforcement  defense and prosecution of intellectual property rights  united states patent and trademark office interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings in the united states and elsewhere involve complex legal and factual questions 
as a result  these proceedings are costly and time consuming  and their outcome is uncertain 
litigation may be necessary to assert claims of infringement  enforce our issued and licensed patents  protect our trade secrets or know how  or determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
we have limited experience in manufacturing and may encounter problems or delays that could result in lost revenue 
our current manufacturing facilities may not be sufficient to support our needs for clinical quantities of our product candidates or commercial quantities of our current adjuvant products 
we have no experience producing commercial quantities of any product  or in producing clinical grade or commercial amounts of our proprietary antigen based products  including recombinant proteins or antibodies 
we currently manufacture limited quantities of some antigens and several adjuvants  and are capable of clinical gmp manufacturing of both adjuvants and some finished vaccine products 
if we are unable to manufacture our product candidates in accordance with clinical gmp regulations  the consequent lack of supply of the product candidates could delay our clinical programs 
we intend to rely on third party contract manufacturers to produce larger quantities of recombinant protein or other cell culture based biologicals for clinical trials and product commercialization 
these contract manufacturers and we may be unable to manufacture our proprietary antigen vaccines at a cost or in quantities necessary to make them commercially viable 
third party manufacturers also may be unable to meet our needs with respect to timing  quantity or quality 
if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of required products on acceptable terms  or if we encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with these manufacturers  our preclinical and clinical testing would be delayed  thereby delaying submission of products for regulatory approval  or the market introduction and commercial sale of the products 
moreover  contract manufacturers that we may use must continually adhere to current gmp regulations enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program 
if the facilities of those manufacturers cannot pass a pre approval plant inspection  the fda approval of our product candidates may be delayed or denied 
even if bexxar receives fda approval  we may be unable to manufacture commercial quantities for sale 
bexxar is a radiolabeled antibody  an antibody linked to an isotope 
we have no existing internal capacity or experience with respect to manufacturing radiolabeled antibodies for large scale clinical trials or commercial purposes 
we have entered into an agreement with bi pharma kg to produce bulk anti b antibody and fill the individual product vials with anti b antibody 
we have contracted with 
table of contents bi pharma kg and a third party supplier for labeling and packaging services 
these manufacturers have limited experience producing  labeling and packaging the anti b antibody  and they may be unable to produce our requirements in commercial quantities or with acceptable quality 
we have entered into an agreement with mds nordion  or nordion  for radiolabeling the anti b antibody at nordion s centralized radiolabeling facility 
however  nordion may be unable to produce sufficient radiolabeled antibodies to meet our clinical requirements and  if bexxar is approved and is successful in the market  our commercial requirements 
we are aware of only a limited number of manufacturers capable of producing the anti b antibody in commercial quantities or radiolabeling the antibody with the i radioisotope on a commercial scale 
to establish and qualify a new facility to centrally radiolabel antibodies could take three years or longer 
further  radiolabeled antibody cannot be stockpiled against future shortages due to the eight day half life of the i radioisotope 
accordingly  any change in our existing contractual relationships with  or interruption in supply from  our producer of unlabeled antibody or our radiolabeler would harm our ability to complete our ongoing clinical trials and to market bexxar  if approved 
although we are evaluating additional sources of supply for production and radiolabeling of the anti b antibody  we may be unable to secure additional sources on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis  if at all 
because we have limited sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  we may be unable to successfully commercialize bexxar or our other product candidates 
as a result of our acquisition of coulter pharmaceutical  inc in december   we have a sales and marketing force focused on bexxar sales and marketing in the united states 
we have hired direct sales and marketing personnel in preparation for the launch of bexxar 
however  our ability to market bexxar  if approved  will be contingent upon recruiting  training and deploying the remainder of the necessary sales and marketing force  as well as gsk s performance under our collaboration agreement 
developing an effective sales force will require a significant amount of our financial resources and time 
we may be unable to establish and manage an effective sales force in a timely or cost effective manner  if at all  and any sales force we do establish may not be capable of generating demand for bexxar or other product candidates 
we intend to rely on our corporate partners to market our products outside the united states and  in the case of autoimmune and infectious disease products  worldwide 
our corporate partners may not have the effective sales forces and distribution systems 
if we are unable to maintain or establish relationships and are required to market any of our products directly  we will need to build a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities 
we may be unable to maintain or establish relationships with third parties or build in house sales and distribution capabilities 
if we do not successfully integrate our recent or potential future acquisitions  we may incur unexpected costs and disruptions to our business 
we have completed several acquisitions of complementary technologies  product candidates and businesses 
in the future  we may acquire additional complementary companies  products and product candidates or technologies 
managing these acquisitions has entailed and may in the future entail numerous operational and financial risks and strains  including exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies  higher than expected acquisition and integration costs  difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of acquired businesses with our operations and personnel  disruption of our business and diversion of our management s time and attention to integrating or completing the development or commercialization of any acquired technologies  
table of contents impairment of relationships with key customers of acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership  inability to retain key employees of acquired businesses  and increased amortization expenses if an acquisition results in significant intangible assets or potential write downs of goodwill and other intangible assets due to impairment of the assets 
for example  in december we acquired coulter pharmaceutical  inc  or coulter  a publicly held biotechnology company specializing in  among other things  the development of therapeutic antibodies  including bexxar 
as a result of our acquisition of coulter  we acquired direct sales and marketing personnel in preparation for the launch of bexxar 
in an effort to minimize expenses during the delay in the fda review of bexxar  we initiated expense reductions  including a reduction in total headcount in march the majority of these reductions took place in the operations that we acquired from coulter 
regulatory approval by the fda for bexxar may be further delayed or rejected  in which case we may not gain substantial benefit from the coulter acquisition 
if we do not obtain regulatory approval of bexxar we may significantly reduce or discontinue the integration process of coulter  notwithstanding the expenditure of a significant amount of time and financial  personnel and other resources 
we depend heavily on the principal members of our management and scientific staff  the loss of any of whom could impair our ability to compete 
the loss of the services of any of the principal members of our management and scientific staff could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our scientific or business objectives 
competition among biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies for qualified employees is intense  and the ability to retain and attract qualified individuals is critical to our success 
we may be unable to attract and retain these individuals currently or in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers  employees or consultants 
we also have relationships with scientific collaborators at academic and other institutions  some of whom conduct research at our request or assist us in formulating our research  development or clinical strategy 
these scientific collaborators are not our employees and may have commitments to  or consulting or advisory contracts with  other entities that may limit their availability to us 
we have limited control over the activities of these scientific collaborators and can generally expect these individuals to devote only limited amounts of time to our activities 
failure of any of these persons to devote sufficient time and resources to our programs could harm our business 
in addition  these collaborators may have arrangements with other companies to assist the companies in developing technologies that may compete with our products 
if we are unable to compete effectively in the highly competitive biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries  our business will fail 
the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive  and we may be unable to compete effectively in these industries 
many companies and institutions compete with us in developing alternative therapies to treat or prevent autoimmune diseases  cancer and infectious diseases  including pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  academic institutions  and research organizations 
moreover  technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to our business may be acquired or licensed by our competitors  thereby preventing us from obtaining technology on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
many of the companies developing competing technologies and products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development  manufacturing  preclinical and clinical 
table of contents development  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than we do 
other smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research and development  manufacturing  preclinical and clinical development  obtaining regulatory approval and marketing of products similar to ours 
these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring and developing technologies complementary to our programs 
we will face competition with respect to product efficacy and safety  timing and scope of regulatory approvals  availability of resources  reimbursement coverage  product price  and patent position 
competitors may develop more effective or more affordable products  or may achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization  than we do 
these competitive products may achieve a greater market share or render our products obsolete 
idec s product  zevalin  received fda approval for commercial sale in the united states in february zevalin has been approved for the treatment of nhl  the indication for which we are seeking approval to sell bexxar in the us consequently  idec could have a significant advantage over corixa in sales and marketing of zevalin due to the fact that zevalin has progressed further in the regulatory approval process than bexxar 
our stock price could be very volatile and your shares may suffer a decline in value 
the market prices for securities of biotechnology companies have in the past been  and are likely to continue in the future to be  very volatile

if cmi engages in such transactions this will result in advance sales of additional shares into the market for our common stock  which could create downward pressure on our stock price 
any claims relating to our improper handling  storage or disposal of hazardous materials could be time consuming and costly 
our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials and biological waste 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and waste products 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of an accident  we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines  and this liability could exceed our resources 
we may have to incur significant costs to comply with future environmental laws and regulations 
the manufacture and administration of bexxar requires the handling  use and disposal of i  a radioactive isotope of iodine 
these activities must comply with various state and federal regulations 
violations of these regulations could significantly delay completion of clinical trials and commercialization of bexxar 
for our ongoing clinical trials and for commercial scale production  we rely on nordion to radiolabel the anti b antibody with i at a single location in canada 
violations of safety regulations could occur with this manufacturer  and there is a risk of accidental contamination or injury 
in the event of any regulatory noncompliance or accident  the supply of radiolabeled anti b antibody for use in clinical trials or commercially could be interrupted

although we have product liability and clinical trial liability insurance that we believe is commercially reasonable  this coverage may be inadequate or may be unavailable in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
defending a suit  regardless of its merit  could be costly and could divert management attention 

table of contents if reimbursement is unavailable for our products  or if laws are adopted restricting the prices we may charge for our products  our revenues may be substantially reduced 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of our products will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as government health administration authorities  private health insurers  health maintenance organizations  pharmacy benefit management companies  and other healthcare related organizations 
if reimbursement is not available for our products  demand for these products may be limited 
federal and state governments in the united states and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation designed to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare 
existing regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals and other medical products may also change before any of our products are approved for marketing 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any product we may develop in the future 
in addition  third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products  including pharmaceuticals 
bexxar  which could potentially be the first radioimmunotherapy for cancer  faces particular uncertainties due to the absence of a comparable  approved therapy to serve as a model for pricing and reimbursement decisions 
further  if bexxar is not administered in most cases on an outpatient basis  as is contemplated currently by us  the projected cost of the therapy will be higher than we anticipate 
our products may not be considered cost effective  and adequate third party reimbursement may be unavailable to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize a return on our investment 
our equity line facility and other transactions may result in dilution and a decline in the price of our common stock 
under the equity line facility with cmi  we may  subject to certain conditions  sell to cmi up to million of our common stock from time to time over a period of two years beginning december  the number of shares and price per share will depend on the market price and trading volume of the shares during the applicable one to twenty day draw down period for any sale 
the sale of shares pursuant to the equity line facility will have a dilutive effect on the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders 
subsequent sales of these shares in the open market by cmi may also have the effect of lowering our stock price  thereby increasing the number of shares issuable under the equity line facility should we choose to sell additional shares to cmi and consequently further diluting our outstanding shares 
these sales could have an immediate adverse effect on the market price of the shares and could result in dilution to the holders of our shares 
in the event that we drew down the maximum amount of approximately  shares under the facility  and issued the additional  shares subject to warrants issued to the placement agent in connection with the facility  these shares would represent approximately of our currently outstanding shares 
the perceived risk associated with the possible sale of a large number of shares issued under the equity line facility at prices as low as per share  which is of the floor share price at which cmi has agreed to purchase our shares  could cause some of our stockholders to sell their stock  thus causing the price of our stock to decline 
in addition  actual or anticipated downward pressure on our stock price due to actual or anticipated sales of stock under the equity line facility could cause some institutions or individuals to engage in short sales of our common stock  which may itself cause the price of our stock to decline 
in addition to any dilution resulting from issuances under the equity line facility  we are also obligated  or in some cases have the option  to issue additional shares of our common stock under collaboration and other strategic agreements 
under a loan agreement with gsk  at our option  we may choose to pay the outstanding principal amount of million together with all accrued unpaid interest thereon in cash or shares of corixa common 
table of contents stock valued at the closing price of corixa common stock on the last trading day preceding the payment date to gsk 
in addition  under a collaborative agreement with gsk  we have an outstanding loan in the amount of million  which amount  together with all accrued unpaid interest is due on september  at gsk s option  gsk may choose to receive the outstanding principal and accrued unpaid interest in cash or shares of our common stock at an undisclosed premium to the then current fair market value of our common stock 
under our stock purchase agreement with amersham health  at our option  we may choose to sell up to million of additional shares of corixa common stock to amersham health at fair market value  which is determined according to the average of the closing prices of our common stock over a specified period surrounding the date of issuance 
under a license assignment agreement with beckman coulter  beckman coulter is entitled to receive royalties upon commercial sale of products  if any  derived from the licenses 
for the first million of royalties  beckman coulter has the option  in lieu of receiving cash  to receive shares of corixa common stock valued at the then current fair market value of our common stock 
we are also required to pay dividends on our preferred stock 
the dividend can be paid in cash or common stock  at our option 
the maximum amount of cash that would be paid in a year would be million and the maximum number of shares of common stock that would be issued is  if we issue additional stock under these agreements  as dividends on our preferred stock or pursuant to other transactions  it will have a dilutive effect on the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders 
although from time to time  we expect to enter into new partnerships  acquisitions and other strategic transactions in which we may agree to issue additional common stock  we currently have no present understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to such additional transactions 
state laws and our certificate of incorporation may inhibit potential acquisition bids that could be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware and washington law  will make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial for our stockholders 
this could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for our shares of common stock 
for example  certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws allow our board to issue preferred stock without any vote or further action by the stockholders  eliminate the right of stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting  eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors  specify a supermajority requirement for stockholders to call a special meeting  specify restrictive procedures for director nominations by stockholders  specify that directors may be removed only with cause  and specify a supermajority requirement for stockholders to change the number of directors 
we are subject to certain provisions of delaware and washington law  which could also delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us 
in particular  section of the delaware general corporation law prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in certain business combinations with any interested stockholder for a period of three years unless specific conditions are met 
similarly  chapter b 
of the washington business corporation act prohibits corporations based in washington from engaging in certain business combinations with any interested stockholder for a period of five years unless specific conditions are met 
in addition  certain provisions of delaware and washington law could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of us  including  without limitation  discouraging a proxy contest or making more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock 
the provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock
