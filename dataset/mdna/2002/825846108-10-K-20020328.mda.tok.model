item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a vertically integrated  multinational pharmaceutical company that focuses on generic finished dosage injectable pharmaceuticals  active pharmaceutical ingredients  or apis  and generic biopharmaceuticals 
we operate and manage our business on a geographic basis  which means that we consider our operating units to be the united states  italy  mexico and  as a result of our recently acquired biopharmaceuticals operations  lithuania  which we completed in july accordingly  our operating results through june  do not include any amounts related to our biopharmaceutical operations 
our operations in the united states are devoted entirely to finished dosage injectable pharmaceutical products while our operations in italy are devoted entirely to apis 
in mexico  for the twelve months ended december   approximately of our revenues were derived from finished dosage injectable pharmaceutical products with the balance from the manufacture and sale of apis 
our finished dosage injectable pharmaceuticals operations represented of our total revenues and of our total income before income taxes for the year ended december  our api operations represented of our total revenues and of our total income before income taxes for the year ended december  for the three years ended december   the units that correspond to the united states  italy and mexico are further described in note segment and geographic information in the notes to the december  audited consolidated financial statements 
our revenues 
we generate most of our revenues from the sale of our finished dosage injectable pharmaceutical products  including revenue from contract manufacturing 
we derive a substantial portion of our overall product sales from our patented generic formulation of propofol  which if negatively impacted could have a material adverse effect on us 
we sell propofol in the united states through baxter  our exclusive marketing partner for several products sold in the united states 
revenues attributable to the baxter alliance accounted for  and of our consolidated net revenue during   and respectively  of which a substantial majority was derived from the sale of propofol 
although our api revenues represented approximately of our total product revenues in  they only contributed approximately to our total income before income taxes 
our api operations have considerably lower gross margins than our finished dosage pharmaceutical products operations 
this is due  in part  to active competition from developing nations  such as china and india  who manufacture api products with very low cost structures 
as a result of our recent acquisition of biotechna uab on july   we currently generate revenues from the sale of two biopharmaceutical products  human growth hormone and interferon a b 
we expect revenues from biopharmaceutical products to grow in the future as patents on such products expire in western europe and the united states 
as competition increases from other generic pharmaceutical manufacturers  our selling prices and related profit margins tend to decrease as these manufacturers gain regulatory approvals to market generic products and compete with lower prices 
thus  our future operating results are dependent on  among other factors  our ability to introduce new generic products before our competition 
our costs and expenses 
cost of sales for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively  which yielded a product gross margin in those years of   and  respectively 
product cost of sales increased in proportion to growth in sales volume since  however  product gross margins have been progressively increasing primarily as a result of a favorable mix of newer products which generally carry higher margins than our more mature products 
research and development expenses for the years ended december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
in the past  research and development expenses have represented  on average  to of total revenues 
however  we expect our research and development expenses to increase as we pursue new product opportunities  especially those that may require clinical trials 
from time to time  we may supplement our research and development efforts by entering into research and development agreements  joint ventures and other collaborative arrangements with other companies to enhance and complement our product development program 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and were million of revenue  million of revenue and million of revenue  respectively 
these expenses may increase as we support the launch of new products 
biotechna acquisition 
on july   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of gatio  a holding company  which is the sole owner of biotechna  in exchange for million shares of our common stock 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method  and as a result  we recorded a charge of million for in process research and development 
additionally  we established million of non amortizable goodwill and million of developed technology  the latter of which will result in amortization expense of million per year over the next ten years 
dividends on preferred stock 
dividends relate to our convertible exchangeable preferred stock  par value  issued in february annual dividends on our preferred stock of million in  and  respectively  consisted of payments of million during each of the four quarters 
in  we purchased or redeemed all  shares of our preferred stock in exchange for million in cash and  shares of our common stock 
change in accounting principle 
we recorded a charge of million  net of tax  in the first quarter of to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the required adoption of sab no 
issued by the sec 
sab no 
required us to change our accounting method for recognizing revenue for several contracts 
recently issued accounting standards 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we applied the new rules in accounting for acquisitions consummated after june  and beginning in the first quarter of on accounting for existing goodwill and other intangible assets 
starting in  the application of the nonamortization provisions of sfas no 
to existing goodwill at june  is expected to result in an increase in net income of approximately million per year 
by june   we will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  we have not yet determined what the effect of these tests will be on our earnings and financial position 
in october  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas 
the statement supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  however it retains the fundamental provisions of that statement related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used 
the company will adopt fas as of january  the company has not yet determined the impact this standard will have on its operating results and financial position 
tax loss carryforwards and tax credits 
as of december   the company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
we have recognized the benefit for the carryforward amount we believe will be more likely than not to be realized 
the remainder is reserved with a valuation allowance 
we will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on an annual basis 
the acquisition of rakepoll holding by the company caused a cumulative change in ownership of more than within the three year period ending on february  pursuant to the internal revenue service code  annual use of our net operating loss and credit carryforward is limited 
this limitation has been considered in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
results of operations comparison of operating results for the years ended december   and earnings summary 
total revenues for were million as compared to million in and million in in  we reported net income applicable to common shares of million  as compared to net income applicable to common shares of million in  and million in in  we recorded a million charge for in process research and development related to our acquisition of biotechna in the second quarter  an impairment charge of million related to our italian operations in the first quarter of  and a million income tax benefit associated with our net operating loss carryforward 
our results included a million charge  net of taxes  for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab during the second quarter of  we divested a interest in metabasis  a proprietary research and development subsidiary  to metabasis management 
subsequently  due to the uncertain value of the remaining interest  we wrote off our remaining million investment in metabasis 
as a result of the divestiture  the operating results of metabasis are only included in our consolidated results through the quarter ended march  starting in the second quarter of  metabasis has been accounted for under the equity method 
after taking into account certain additional financing obtained by metabasis in july and october  we retain an approximately equity interest 
product sales 
product sales increased to million in from million in and million in our product sales increased approximately in compared to the increase was due primarily to higher sales of propofol and contract manufacturing in the united states 
propofol sales during accounted for more than one third of the increase in revenue from offsetting the increase were lower sales of finished dosage products to the mexican government in relative to the increase in our product sales in compared to was mainly due to higher sales of our propofol product in the united states  accounting for approximately of the increase 
also contributing to higher product sales in were increased sales of specialty products by our us operations and higher sales by our mexican operations to the mexican government s public hospital programs 
offsetting the increase in product sales in relative to was a one time sale of oncology finished goods inventory to abbott  in january  resulting from a sales and distribution agreement entered into with abbott at that time 
pursuant to the hatch waxman act  we had a day exclusive period in which to sell propofol without other generic competition 
the day exclusivity period was initiated in the second quarter of with the commercial launch of propofol and expired on october  contract and license fees 
we did not record contract research and license fees during and as compared to million recorded during the decrease was mainly due to a million non recurring reimbursement received in march from baxter for expenses incurred by us for propofol research and development and the partial divestiture of metabasis in the second quarter of costs and expenses 
cost of sales in was million which yielded a product gross margin of  compared to cost of sales of million in which yielded a product gross margin of  and cost of sales of million in which yielded a gross margin of 
the increase in gross margin in was due primarily to increased sales of propofol and other new products and reduced per unit overhead costs due to increased manufacturing volumes 
the increase in gross margin in relative to was mainly due to sales of propofol in the united states  sales of corticosteroid products in italy  as well as increased production efficiencies due to upgrading of facilities and equipment in mexico 
research and development expenses totaled million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in relative to is mainly due to expenses of our newly acquired biotechna subsidiary  which did not exist in the prior year  as well as higher development expenses in mexico related to our biotechnology business initiated with the acquisition of biotechna 
the increase in expenses in compared to was mainly due to a million charge for a technology acquisition from aesgen  inc during the second quarter of  as well as higher product development expenses in the united states and mexico 
this increase was offset by the absence of million in research and development expenses incurred by metabasis prior to its partial divestiture in the second quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in compared to is primarily due to higher selling and legal expense  as well as administrative expenses of biotechna  which did not exist in the prior year 
also included in the increase is compensation expense of million through september  relating to options granted to mr 
samson  our president and chief executive officer  while he was a consultant 
in addition  we recorded million of deferred compensation as of september   which we will amortize ratably to compensation expense through april  to reflect the appropriate treatment of mr 
samson s options once he became an employee 
the increase in expenses in relative to was primarily due to a non cash compensation charge of million in the first quarter of for performance incentives earned by mr 
panoz under the terms of his agreement to serve as our non executive chairman of the board  of which million was related to the vesting of mr 
panoz s stock options and million was recorded when we reached a market capitalization of billion 
also contributing to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was a charge of million for legal reserves  higher management incentive compensation costs associated with our increased profitability and additional expenses associated with the development of a private sector sales force in mexico 
the charge for legal reserves represented our estimate of costs that will be incurred in connection with an ongoing investigation by the us department of justice and us department of health and human services regarding issues surrounding pricing information reported by drug manufacturers and used in the calculation of reimbursements made under medicaid 
we recorded amortization of goodwill and intangibles expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we had interest and other expenses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the reduction in net interest expense was primarily due to increased interest income earned on higher cash and short term investment balances  and a reduction in foreign exchange losses 
the decrease in interest and other expenses in compared to was largely due to increased interest income earned on higher cash and short term investment balances and reduced interest expense due to the conversion of long term debt to equity in the second quarter of offsetting this reduction were increased expenses associated with deferred mandatory profit sharing and foreign exchange losses at our mexican operations 
since our divestiture of a interest in metabasis and our subsequent write off of our remaining million investment in the second quarter of  the financial activity of metabasis has not been reflected in our consolidated financial results 
income tax expense 
we recorded income tax benefit of million in as compared with million and million of tax expense for the years ended december  and respectively 
the tax benefit for included million from the reduction in the valuation allowance to recognize deferred tax assets related to us operations 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  we will continue to evaluate the need to maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
minority interest income 
we had minority interest income of  for the year ended december  which represented the minority stockholders proportionate share of the loss in metabasis 
metabasis was partially divested by us in the second quarter of  and has since that time not been reflected in our consolidated financial results 
summary of critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
our significant accounting policies include revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales upon transfer of title to the product  which generally occurs upon shipment of products to customers  upon fulfillment of acceptance terms  if any  and when no significant contractual obligations remain 
we estimate sales reductions that arise due to wholesaler chargebacks  medicaid sponsored payor allowance discounts  rebates  and early payment discounts 
we also reduce revenues for estimated product returns at the time of sale based on historical trends 
for contracts under which we are reimbursed for research and development efforts  we recognize revenue in accordance with the terms of the contract as the related expenses are incurred 
amounts recorded as revenues are not dependent upon the success of the research efforts 
we recognize nonrefundable license fees and milestone revenue from business partners over the term of the associated agreement unless the fee or milestone is in exchange for products delivered or services performed that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
reserves for excess and obsolete inventories are provided based on inventory levels on hand  future purchase commitments  and current product demand 
if future demand were significantly less favorable than that projected by management  then increases to the reserve would be required 
accounts receivable 
we estimate allowances for potential credit losses based on past trends 
our losses have historically been within our expectations 
we generate approximately of our revenue and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to a single customer 
if our primary customer experiences significant adverse conditions in its operations  our customer may not be able to meet its ongoing financial obligations to us for prior sales or complete the purchase of additional products from us under the terms of our existing sales commitments 
such commitments would have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
outstanding accounts receivable from this customer approximated million as of december  deferred tax assets 
as of december   we have approximately million of deferred tax assets related principally to domestic federal and california net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in and  respectively  for which a valuation allowance of approximately million has been recorded 
the realization of these assets is based upon estimates of future taxable income and projections utilized in our internal forecasts 
we evaluate the level of our valuation allowance annually  as long as we are profitable  and more frequently if our operating results significantly decline 
impairment 
through december   we reviewed long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the total amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
we recognized an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition were less than its carrying amount 
after december   accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require us to adopt statement of financial accounting standard no 
which will require us to analyze our goodwill for impairment using a fair value approach during the first six months of fiscal  and then on an annual basis thereafter 
the annual goodwill fair value evaluations under statement no 
are expected to be based on a combination of present value cash flow analyses and considerations as to the market price of our stock 
these factors and assumptions  and changes in them  could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future 
management has not yet determined the impact that the initial adoption of this standard will have on our operating results and financial position 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million and working capital of million compared to million and million  respectively  as of december  the increase in cash in was mainly due to our generation of million in cash from operations and million in financing activities following the issuance of million shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
these net cash inflows were partially offset by a net investment of million in property and equipment and the establishment of a million compensating balance for our biotechna credit facility 
a significant source of operating cash flow during was a million increase in accounts payable and accruals  which was partially offset by like amounts in other current assets 
the increase in accounts payable and accruals was primarily attributable to higher purchases of raw materials and timing of payments  as well as a higher income tax liability related to increased taxable income 
the increase in inventory levels primarily reflects our expectation of continued expansion at our us operations 
we invested million in property and equipment during  as compared to million during the prior year 
the increase mainly reflects ongoing investment in plant and equipment infrastructure at our domestic  italian  and mexican operations in order to support current manufacturing levels  as well as the anticipated launch of new products 
we generated million in cash flow from financing activities during  which consisted primarily of cash proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock and warrants  offset mainly by a net reduction of million in long term debt and capital lease obligations and the payment of million in cash dividends to our preferred stockholders 
these changes reflect an inflow of million following the issuance of million shares of common stock during the third quarter  as well as an increase in cash outflows towards long term debt and capital lease obligations  primarily in italy and lithuania 
factors that may affect future financial condition and liquidity we expect to incur additional costs  including development  manufacturing and marketing costs  to support existing products and anticipated launches of new products 
planned spending on worldwide product development and marketing activities during is approximately million 
our management also plans to invest approximately million through the end of in plant and equipment to increase and improve existing manufacturing capacity worldwide 
we expect to fund capital spending through cash flows from operations and new lease agreements 
cash requirements for biotechna were approximately million during the fourth quarter of we expect to continue to fund biotechna s cash requirements  including approximately million in  and approximately million in the first quarter of the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
we also may be required to pay up to approximately million in milestone payments  plus sales royalties  in the event that all the research under certain development agreements is successful 
contractual obligations total less than year years after years long term debt     capital lease obligations  operating leases     capital expenditures   total contractural obligations     we expect that our operating cash flows  our current cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments at december  of million and commitments from third parties  will enable us to maintain our current and planned operations 
in connection with our plans for expanding our business to accomplish our core strategy of being a leading vertically integrated provider of specialty pharmaceutical products and materials  our management and board of directors will continue to evaluate the need to raise additional capital and  if appropriate  pursue equity  debt or lease financing  or a combination of these  for our capital and investment needs 
financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in the normal course of business  we are exposed to the risks associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk 
at december   we had current cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of approximately million 
these investments consist of cash and highly liquid debt securities 
these investments may be subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by from the market interest rates at december  would cause the fair market value of our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to change by an immaterial amount 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income 
additionally  we are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our debt outstanding 
most of our long term borrowings are based on fixed interest rates and therefore not subject to material risk from changes in interest rates 
short term borrowings  however  are based on prime or other indicative base rates plus a premium 
if these indicative base rates increase  we will incur higher relative interest expense and similarly  a decrease in the rates will reduce relative interest expense 
a change in the prime rate or other indicative base rates would not materially change interest expense assuming levels of debt consistent with historical amounts 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we are exposed to exchange rate risk when our subsidiaries enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency 
our italian operations hedge against transactional risks by borrowing against receivables and against economic risk by buying us dollar put euro call options on a monthly basis to strike at a rate equal to or above our budgeted exchange rate 
in november  sicor spa entered into twelve monthly spa million us dollar put euro call options at a strike price of euro per us  exercisable at the end of each month starting in january the cost of each call option is expensed as it becomes exercisable  and any resulting gain is recognized as a foreign exchange gain 
as of february   none of the call options had been exercised
