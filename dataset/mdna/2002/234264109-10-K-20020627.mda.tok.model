item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
the company designs  manufactures and sells a wide range of computer programmable information display systems to customers in a variety of markets throughout the world 
the company focuses its sales and marketing efforts on markets rather than products 
major categories of markets include sport  business  and transportation 
the company s net sales and profitability historically have fluctuated due to the impact of large product orders  such as display systems for the olympic games and major league sport facilities  as well as the seasonality of the sports market 
the company s gross margins on large product orders tend to fluctuate more than those for small standard orders 
large product orders that involve competitive bidding and substantial subcontract work for product installation generally have lower gross margins 
although the company follows the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues for these larger orders  the company nevertheless has experienced fluctuations in operating results and expects that its future results of operations may be subject to similar fluctuations 
the company operates on a week fiscal year  with fiscal years ending on the saturday closest to april of each year 
the company s fiscal year contained weeks 
for a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements and the effects of those pronouncements on the financial results of the company  refer to note of the financial statements of the company  which are included elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to estimated total costs on long term contracts  estimated costs to be incurred for product warranties and extended maintenance contracts  bad debts  and contingencies 
its estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition on long term contracts 
earnings on long term contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs for each contract 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are estimatable 
generally  contracts entered into by the company have fixed prices established and to the extent the actual costs to complete contracts are higher than the amounts estimated as of the date of the financial statements  the resulting gross margin would be negatively effected in future quarters when the company revises its estimates 
the company s practice is to revise estimates as soon as such changes in estimates are known 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty  extended warranty and product maintenance 
the company has created a reserve for standard warranties on its products equal to its estimate of the actual costs expected to be incurred in connection with it performance under the warranty 
it also has deferred estimated revenue related to separately priced extended warranties and product maintenance agreements  based in part on its estimate of its costs expected to be incurred in connection with these agreements 
in the event that the company would become aware of an increase in its warranty and maintenance reserves  deferrals of additional reserves may become necessary  resulting in an increase in costs of goods sold 
as of april   the company had a total of million deferred for these costs and revenues 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of net sales represented by items included in the company s consolidated statements of income for the fiscal years ended  and years ended net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses operating income interest income interest expense other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income net sales net sales decreased to million for fiscal year as compared to approximately million for fiscal year net sales in the sports and transportation markets increased in fiscal year over fiscal year  while sales in the business markets declined  offsetting the sports and transportation increases 
the increases in the sports markets were primarily in smaller venues as compared to larger venues 
the larger venue revenues were down as a result of the actual timing of orders which were booked later than expected in the fourth quarter of fiscal year order bookings were up in all categories of the sports market  including large and small venues 
the decline in net sales for the business markets was the result of the slowing economic conditions experienced during most of the second half of fiscal year and the impact of a large order in fiscal year that was not repeated in fiscal year a single large order in the business market had contributed approximately million in net sales in fiscal year excluding the revenue from that single large order  sales in the business market were approximately flat in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year finally  offsetting the decline in the business markets due to the factors mentioned was an increase in sales to national retail chain accounts in the fourth quarter of fiscal year overall sales were effected by delays in booking orders across all markets beginning late in the second quarter and through the third quarter as customers hesitated due to the effects on the economy after the events of september  as the company progressed into the fourth quarter of fiscal year  it appeared as though the trends of flat and declining sales overall were reversing and the company is expecting increasing sales in the future 
the company s backlog at the end of the fiscal year was in excess of million  which was the highest year end level in the company s history and an increase over fiscal year end backlog of million 
the increase in backlog was primarily in the sports markets and resulted from a number of large orders booked late in the fourth quarter 
the backlog varies significantly quarter to quarter due to the larger orders and therefore significant variations can be expected as explained previously herein 
in addition the company s backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales or net income  also explained previously 
net sales for fiscal were million  representing a increase over fiscal sales of million 
the increase was the result of increased sales in the sports  business and transportation markets 
the company occasionally sells products in exchange for advertising revenues from the scoreboard or display 
these sales represented less than of net sales for fiscal  and the gross profit margin on these net sales has been comparable to the gross profit margin on other net sales 
gross profit gross profit decreased by less than from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross profit percentage increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year the decrease in gross margin dollars was due to the lower level of sales mentioned above offset by improvements in the gross margin percentage on some specific long term contracts which are not expected to occur in the future and an improvement in product mix between higher margin standard products and lower margin long term contracts 
the higher than expected margins on certain long term contracts resulted from various factors such as a one time improvement in certain raw materials prices and higher negotiated margins on a few significant long term contracts 
the increases were offset partially by negative impacts of costs incurred which are not expected to continue into as the company worked hard to reduce inventory levels  incurring higher costs of obsolescence as it becomes more aggressive in order to reduce costs of carrying the excess inventory over the long term 
the company continues to strive towards higher margin percentages  although depending on the actual mix of net sales in the future  margin percentages may not actually increase 
gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due to increased sales and continued improvement in gross profit percentage of sales as the company continued its cost improvement programs  including product standardization 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal and in fiscal operating expenses operating expenses  which are comprised of selling  general and administrative and product design and development increased by approximately from million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year beginning with the third quarter of fiscal year  the company began building its operating expense infrastructure in preparation of the expected growth in net sales in fiscal year this buildup continued until the middle of the second quarter of fiscal year when the company began to see that the anticipated level of sales for the year would not be achievable 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year  the company undertook efforts to reduce certain operating expenses  keeping in mind its belief in the market as a whole and an expectation that the current economic conditions that the company was experiencing were not long term 
as such  operating expenses were not reduced to levels consistent with the fiscal year net sales 
operating expenses were reduced to the levels that would support the company in a return to levels of growth which could be expected as the economy turned around and orders started to book again 
although the levels of spending were reduced  it is expected that in the absence of changing conditions  operating expenses as a whole will be similar in fiscal year to fiscal year selling expenses 
selling expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs  travel and entertainment  facilities related costs for sales and service offices  and expenditures for marketing efforts including such things as collateral materials  conventions and trade shows  product demos and supplies 
selling expenses increased to million for fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses were and of net sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increases in both actual amounts spent and the percentage of sales resulted from higher levels of personnel costs as the infrastructure was built as explained above 
during this time of higher costs  the company invested in personnel and offices as it expanded its sales force regionally  focusing on developing a stronger presence geographically and on building new business units within the company  primarily its keyframe business to support the needs of the higher priced  more complicated prostar r and proad r systems 
in connection with these higher personnel costs  the company also experienced higher costs in indirect categories  such as telephone and office expenses 
in addition  the company experienced higher bad debt expenses related to isolated issues  generally not related to product quality or service and higher commissions paid to resellers 
finally  during the year the company spent more on advertising and related costs in order to achieve higher order bookings 
these increased costs were partially offset by a decline in product demo costs and lower travel costs as a result of more sales staff being located in geographic regions as opposed to the company s main facilities 
selling expenses increased in fiscal year over fiscal year this increase was primarily attributable to the expansion of sales staff and higher travel expenses as the company continues to expand its marketing efforts and the company s increased sales 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs  professional fees  shareholder relations costs  facilities and equipment related costs for administrative departments  amortization of intangibles and supplies 
general and administrative costs increased approximately to million in fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year as a percent of sales  general and administrative expenses were and of net sales for fiscal year and  respectively 
the increases in both the dollars and the percentage of sales relate to higher costs of personnel as mentioned above  higher professional fees as a result of higher legal and audit related fees due to the resignation of the chief financial officer in fiscal year  higher health and other insurance costs related to higher claims in the company s self funded health insurance program and a one time increase in the value of life insurance policies during fiscal year these increased costs were offset by the decline in bonuses paid to the executive management of the company 
for fiscal year no bonuses were earned by executive management 
the company expects that general and administrative expenses may increase slightly in fiscal year general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal year over the previous fiscal year 
the increase was due to the increased administrative support to sustain the company s sales growth  including increased depreciation on computer equipment and office furniture 
product design and development expenses 
product design and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs  facilities and equipment related costs and supplies 
product development expenses increased approximately to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year as a percent of sales  product development expenses were and of net sales for fiscal year and  respectively 
generally  product design and development expenses increase during times when the company s engineering resources do not have to be more dedicated to long term contracts  as the same personnel who work on research and development also work on long term contracts 
when the expected levels of net sales did not materialize as expected in fiscal year  more time was spent on research and development 
included in these higher costs were increased costs of personnel and related costs  supplies and other related items 
during the year  the company made significant enhancements as a result of these higher costs which are expected to benefit future years net sales 
for the future  the company expects product design and development expenses to be approximately of net sales 
product development expenses increased for fiscal year over the previous fiscal year 
the increases were due to the company s commitment to develop new products and continue to improve existing products to maintain a competitive advantage 
the increases were primarily the result of the company aggressively developing its family of prostar r video displays and proad r digital advertising and information systems  and adapting other products to led technology 
interest income the company occasionally sells products on an installment basis or in exchange for the rights to sell and retain advertising revenues from the scoreboard or display  both of which result in long term receivables 
interest income resulting from these long term receivables increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year interest income was approximately of net sales for both years 
the increase resulted primarily from a higher average level of interest bearing long term receivables outstanding during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the company expects the levels of interest income to decline in the future as it seeks outside third parties to finance these transactions as opposed to the company 
interest income decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year factors affecting the decrease include the average balance of long term receivables resulting from new receivables  principal repayments  the average interest rate  and excess cash balances invested in interest bearing accounts 
interest expense interest expense is comprised primarily of interest costs on the company s notes payable and long term debt 
interest expenses decreased to million as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily the result of lower average interest rates paid on the debt as rates declined over the year 
this decrease was however offset by higher average levels of debt over the year 
the company expects interest expense to decline into fiscal year  as it limits activities causing debt to increase 
this expectation could change in the event the company is able to make strategic investments in the future 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the increases in interest expense was the result of increased average loan balances as the company utilized its line of credit and long term debt to fund increased operating activities 
income taxes income taxes decreased to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decline was due principally to the lower net income before taxes 
the effective income tax rate was and for the fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in the effective rate was primarily the result of higher state income tax expense 
the company expects that the effective income tax rate will decline in fiscal year the key items reconciling the effective income tax rate to the statutory rates are contained in the financial statements included in this report 
liquidity and capital resources working capital was million at april   compared to million at april  the company has historically financed working capital needs through a combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings under bank credit agreements 
the increase in working capital was primarily the result of the increase in cash provided by operations which was used to pay down short term debt and which included lower levels of inventory and receivables as the company converted those items to cash for debt repayment 
cash provided by operations for fiscal year was million 
net income of million plus depreciation and amortization of million  plus a decrease in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in inventory of million  an increase in customer deposits of million  a decrease in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings and an increase in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings totalling and various other decreases in operating assets and increases in operating liabilities were offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and other items 
included in receivables as of april  was approximately million of retainage on long term contracts  all of which is expected to be collected in one year 
the improvement in cash provided by operations resulted from company wide efforts to improve the levels of inventory and accounts receivable and a focus on cash flow 
the company also used its cash more on debt reduction as opposed funding a build up of operating assets 
during the fiscal year the company also made efforts to convert selected long term receivables to cash 
the company invested approximately million in equipment for its sportslink subsidiary to increase its fleet of video boards available for rental 
in addition  sportslink purchased additional facilities within close proximity to the company s existing manufacturing facilities in order to increase capacity and to house its sportslink business 
the total cost of the new facilities  which was approximately million  was financed through a contract for deed with the seller of the property 
during fiscal year  the company invested approximately million in office equipment and furniture as it expanded its general office space to accommodate its planned growth in personnel to support higher sales and invested million in manufacturing equipment  
million in facility improvements  and the remaining investments in transportation equipment  demo products and other items 
cash used by financing activities for fiscal year was million  which consisted primarily of million of net payments on notes payable and payments on long term debt 
this use was offset by borrowings under long term debt arrangements of million and 
million from proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
the company has used and expects to continue to use cash reserves and bank borrowings to meet its short term working capital requirements 
on large product orders  the time between order acceptance and project completion may extend up to months depending on the amount of custom work and the customer s delivery needs 
the company often receives a down payment or progress payments on these product orders 
to the extent that these payments are not sufficient to fund the costs and other expenses associated with these orders  the company uses working capital and bank borrowings to finance these cash requirements 
the company s product development activities include the enhancement of existing products and the development of new products from existing technologies 
product development expenses for fiscal years  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the company intends to continue to incur these expenditures to develop new display products using various display technologies to offer higher resolution  more cost effective and energy efficient displays 
the company also intends to continue developing software applications for its display controllers to enable these products to continue to meet the needs and expectations of the marketplace

business risks and uncertainties a number of risks and uncertainties exist which could impact the company s future operating results 
these uncertainties include  but are not limited to  general economic conditions  competition  the company s success in developing new products and technologies  market acceptance of new products  and other factors  including those set forth in the company s sec filings 
recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board has issued certain statements of financial accounting standards  which have required effective dates occurring after the company s april  year end 
the company s financial statements  including the disclosures therein  are not expected to be materially affected by those accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rates through april  substantially all of the company s net sales were denominated in united states dollars  and its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes has been immaterial 
through april   net sales originating outside the united states  substantially all of which were denominated in united states dollars were of total net sales 
it is expected that net sales in the future to international markets may increase as a percentage of net sales  however  the company does not expect that such increase in such sales will be denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  operating results are not expected to become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of certain currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
however  to the extent that the company engages in international sales denominated in united states dollars  an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make the company s products less competitive in international markets 
although the company will continue to monitor its exposure to currency fluctuations  and  when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing economic conditions  changes in political climates  differing tax structures and other rules and regulations could adversely affect the company s financial results in the future 
interest rate risks the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s debt and long term accounts receivable 
the company maintains a blend of both fixed and floating rate debt instruments 
as of april   the company s outstanding debt approximated million  with approximately million in fixed rate obligations 
increases or decreases in interest rates would not have a material annual effect on variable rate debt interest based on the balances of such debt as of as of april  for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect its fair market value  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
in connection with the sale of the company s products  it has entered into long term sales contracts and sales type leases 
the aggregate amounts due from customers include an imputed interest element 
the majority of these financings carry fixed rates of interest 
as of april   the company s outstanding long term receivables were approximately million 
each basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately  the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations
