item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company is a leading provider of leather and leathercraft related items and headwear trims 
its products are sold worldwide through wholesale distribution channels and direct to consumer channels through the leather factory units  tandy leather s retail stores  mail order and internet  and directly to headwear manufacturers cushman only 
as described above  the company is organized into three related operating segments leather factory  tandy leather  and cushman 
results of operations the following tables present selected financial data of each of the company s three segments for the years ended december   and operating operating operating sales income sales income sales income leather factory       tandy leather     cushman       total operations       the tandy leather assets were acquired in november analysis of compared to consolidated net sales for increased million  or  compared to tandy contributed million to the increase as included a full year of tandy s operations  while only included december operations 
leather factory added an additional million in sales in  partially offset by a sales decline at cushman of  the company experienced an increase in operating income of from to  due primarily to an overall improvement in gross profit margins

the four new units opened in late and contributed a significant portion of the sales increase  while same unit sales increased from to we monitor sales via several different categories one being customer groups 
our customer groups are generally defined as follows customer group group characteristics retail end users  consumers  individuals institution prisons  prisoners  hospitals  schools  ymca  boy scouts  etc 
wholesale saddle tack stores  resellers and distributors  shoe findings and repair shops  dealers  etc 
craft craft stores individually owned and craft store chains midas small manufacturers asc authorized sales centers export foreign customers outside the united states the majority of the overall sales increase was to our craft customers 
our retail sales  while holding steady at of our total sales  increased in dollars by over last year s retail sales 
we experienced sales declines in our institution and midas markets  but compensated by gains in the wholesale  asc  and export groups 
operating income for the leather factory line increased by  and improved the operating margin to net sales from in to in the increase in operating income results from improved gross profit margins as well as a slight improvement in operating efficiency 
operating expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of sales 
management s target for leather factory s operating expenses as a percentage of sales is or less and that target was met for gross margin as a percentage of sales improved by points primarily as a result of the changes we made in sourcing product purchasing from different vendors at a lower price 
our product mix is made up of approximately  items that can be grouped into categories as follows liquids hardware thread tools leather books videos buckles accents kits leather represents approximately of our inventory in dollars at any given time and also represents approximately of our sales 
however  we earn the smallest amount of gross profit margin on the leather we sell for and  gross profit margin on leather sold was approximately 
the improvement in our margins comes from the items sold from the other categories 
these other categories earned gross profit margins ranging from to in  and to in the fluctuation in gross margins occurs primarily as a result of the mix of product categories sold and the correlating profit margins of those categories 
tandy leather operations tandy leather was acquired by the company in november  therefore our results for only included one month s operation for tandy leather 
in  tandy operated strictly as an order fulfillment house for orders generated via phone  fax  mail order  and internet 
our sales target was million  based on tandy s annual sales prior to acquisition 
tandy missed that target by  however  we discovered early in the year that some of tandy s sales were at very low profit margins and  in a few cases  were below cost 
we quickly adjusted selling prices to eliminate these low margin sales problems and as a result  gave up some sales from customers who were not willing to pay the new prices 
as a result  even though tandy s sales were slightly below expectation  we improved gross profit margins by over percentage points 
currently  tandy tracks its sales by customer groups retail individual hobbyists primarily  dealers which is comparable to leather factory s authorized sales centers  institution prisons  prisoners  and hospitals  youth schools  camps  etc  and wholesale resellers and manufacturers 
while we do not have enough financial history to compare categorical sales in to prior years  our sales were made up of the following mix retail  dealers  wholesale  institution  youth 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales were held virtually constant from to at 
while tandy s cost of operations is expected to be higher than that of leather factory due to the higher costs associated with targeting the retail market as compared to the wholesale market  we still believe that tandy can operate more efficiently and will continue to work toward that end 
in the first quarter of  tandy opened retail stores via the acquisition of existing leathercraft stores in oklahoma and idaho 
management has announced its plans to continue the expansion of tandy s retail store chain throughout and beyond  as new store or acquisition opportunities arise and the domestic retail leathercraft market can support new stores 
we are committed to a conservative growth plan in that the company s profits and financial stability are not going to be sacrificed for the sake of quick growth 
cushman cushman s sales were down in  even though we believe that we continue to gain market share from our competitors because of our commitment to timely delivery of quality product 
the primary reason for this decrease is not caused by a reduction in number of trims produced  but in the type of trims produced 
the popularity of the straw hat  which is a more casual hat versus the felt hat  is increasing every year due in part to price paid by the consumer straw hats are less expensive than felt and in part to the fashion trends 
historically  straw hats were worn in the spring and summer seasons while felt hats were the hat of choice in the fall and winter 
now it is acceptable to wear straw hats year round 
the global warming theory may also contribute to this shift in the headwear trend as straw hats are cooler to wear than felt hats 
as a result  the trims being requested by the manufacturers are made from materials other than leather 
leather trims are the most expensive  but generally are not put on straw hats 
therefore  even though we produced as many trims in as we did in  the selling price of these non leather trims is much lower than that of the leather trims 
operating income decreased significantly due primarily to a drop in gross profit margin 
in  we sold some trims at substantially reduced prices for two reasons the market conditions and trends in the headwear industry in general  and to clear out some of our inventory that does not fit with the fashion trends developing 
we reduced our personnel costs late in to help offset the low gross profit margins 
assuming the headwear industry in general and the hat and trim preferences in particular continue their current trends  we believe we are in a position internally to achieve better results in the future 
analysis of compared to consolidated net sales for increased million  or  compared to leather factory contributed million to the increase  sales by tandy leather contributed  in december  and cushman s sales held steady for the year 
the company experienced an increase in operating income of from to due primarily to the sales increase and an improvement in gross profit margins 
change change net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    operating expenses    operating income    other income expense    income before income taxes    income tax provision    net income    leather factory operations net sales for leather factory  which is comprised of sales distribution units as of december   increased over the four units opened mid and two units opened late in contributed of the growth  while same store sales increased from to we also transferred our small finished leather goods division from cushman to leather factory in the spring of and that division s sales were of the leather factory sales increase in the primary sales growth was generated from the retail customer market individual hobbyists 
retail sales in increased from in years past  we focused our marketing efforts primarily toward the wholesale customer 
beginning in  we began to specifically target retail customers in our direct mail advertising program as well as in our sales distribution units 
as a result  we have experienced significant growth in this market 
our asc program generated sales of approximately million in  with approved asc s in the program as of december  this compares to approved ascs as of december  contributing sales of approximately  in our export sales decreased slightly in as well as specific wholesale categories shoe care repair primarily  but were offset by increases in sales in our other core markets saddle and tack  small manufacturers  etc 
operating income from leather factory operations increased by million and improved the operating margin to net sales from in to in the increase in operating income results from improved gross profit margins 
gross margin as a percentage of sales improved by points 
this large improvement was the result of the increase in retail sales as retail sales historically produce higher profit margins than that of wholesale sales 
operating expenses increased by million or of sales 
this is due to increases in payroll costs increased number of employees due to the new sales distribution units opened in  and increase in managers bonuses based on profits earned at the units and advertising costs increased efforts toward retail customers via direct mailing pieces 
tandy leather operations tandy leather was acquired in november and therefore was included in the company s consolidated financial statements for december only 
tandy s sales were  gross profit was  and operating expenses were as a percentage of sales 
tandy had an operating loss of  for the month 
cushman sales of hat trims increased from to even though total sales were even with sales in at million 
approximately  in sales of various finished leather goods are included in the sales totals 
these products have subsequently been transferred to a division of leather factory 
in addition to our quality hatbands sold in  we have captured a significant portion of the buckle market for headwear adornments 
operating income increased  and improved the operating margin by almost over the increase in operating income was the result of improved gross profit margins and a reduction in uncollectible accounts written off 
in  one of cushman s customers went out of business rather unexpectedly and as a result  cushman recorded an unusually large bad debt write off 
a small portion of the amount written off was recovered in and had no other unusual write offs of accounts during cushman s gross profit margins increased approximately due to the introduction of non manufactured trims into its product specifically  cushman began selling finished ie requires no manufacturing on its part feathers  buckles  etc 
to headwear manufacturers 
cushman earns higher margins on this type of product 
financial condition at december   the company had inventory of million and net property and equipment of million 
goodwill and other intangibles net of amortization and depreciation were million and  with the tandy leather asset acquisition resulting in the addition of  in artwork 
net total assets were million 
current liabilities were million including current maturities of long term indebtedness  while long term liabilities were  total stockholders equity at the end of had increased to million  principally as a result of the million of net income recorded by the company during during  net cash provided from operating activities was million 
the company applied million to reduce the outstanding balance on its credit facility described below  leaving an outstanding principal balance of million as of december  at december   the company had inventory of million and net property and equipment of million 
goodwill and other intangibles net of amortization and depreciation were million and  respectively 
the company also holds  in a leather artwork collection  most of which was created by al stohlman  a legendary leathercrafter 
net total assets were million 
current liabilities were million including million of current maturities of long term debt  while long term liabilities were  total stockholders equity at the end of had increased to million  principally as a result of the million of net income recorded by the company during as a result of various acquisitions made during the company s history  the company has recorded goodwill on its balance sheet and has amortized this goodwill through the end of in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new accounting rule regarding the amortization of goodwill sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of that pronouncement  effective january   the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives will cease and goodwill will be subject to an impairment test based on its fair value 
the majority of the goodwill million as presented on our consolidated balance sheet at december  is cushman s 
given that the cushman s goodwill makes up the majority of its separate balance sheet assets and the current trends of the industry in which cushman operates  management has reason to believe that  while projected cash flows have more than substantiated the balance in prior years  it is likely that we will incur an impairment write down of the goodwill balance based on a fair value assessment 
we are unable to determine an amount at this time 
the company has engaged a business valuation firm to determine cushman s fair value and anticipates determining the write down amount  if any  prior to the filing of the first quarter form q 
capital resources and liquidity on november   the company entered into a credit and security agreement with wells fargo business credit  inc wfbc  in which wfbc agreed to provide a credit facility of up to  the credit facility 
the credit facility has a three year term and is secured by all of the assets of the company 
the initial borrowings from wfbc were used to refinance the company s funded indebtedness outstanding at that time 
on november   the company entered into the first amendment to the credit and security agreement amendment with wfbc 
there  wfbc consented to the tandy leather transaction and amended certain financial tests to reflect the acquisition of the tandy leather assets  to make previously contemplated extensions of these tests  and to raise the standards required in those tests based on the company s improved financial performance since the credit agreement was originally signed 
on february   the company entered into the second amendment to the credit and security agreement amendment with wfbc 
there  wfbc granted a special accommodation advance of a maximum of  to be used by the company as needed through july at the time of amendment  the company was anticipating significant cash requirements for payment of income taxes and the annual esop contribution and manager bonuses 
however  the company was able to generate adequate cash flow from its operations to meet these annual cash payments and the special accommodation advance was not needed or drawn

there  wfbc reduced the interest rate on the revolving credit facility from prime to prime at december  
in addition  the capital expenditure limit was increased from  to  for to permit additional expenditures incurred following the acquisition of tandy leather 
amendment also waived all defaults that occurred because our capital expenditures exceeded  before the amendment was put into place 
the company is currently in compliance with all covenants and conditions contained in the credit facility and has no reason to believe that it will not continue to operate in compliance with the provisions of these financing arrangements

critical accounting policies generally accepted accounting principles require the use of management s judgments and estimates in addition to the rules and requirements imposed by the accounting pronouncements 
more detailed information about the accounting policies we use is contained in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements include in this form k 
other accounting policies not discussed here are described there  and readers should review that information carefully 
we have summarized below the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to an understanding of the preparation of our financial statements 
we report our financial information on a consolidated basis 
therefore  unless there is an indication to the contrary  financial information is provided for the parent company  the leather factory  inc  and its subsidiaries as a whole 
transactions between the parent company and any subsidiaries are eliminated for this purpose 
we own all of the capital stock of our subsidiaries  and we do not have any subsidiaries that are not consolidated 
none of our subsidiaries is off balance sheet 
in  we revised the presentation of our financial information from a single segment to three segments leather factory  tandy leather and cushman 
this information is found in note  segment information  to our consolidated financial statements 
segment information permits readers to review summary information on the operating results and financial condition of these segments 
the inventory shown on our balance sheet is accounted for on the first in  first out method 
this means that sales of inventory treat the oldest item of identical inventory as being the first sold 
if  however  the market value of inventory is less than what we paid for it  the lower market value is recorded on the balance sheet 
we have indicated above that a change in the accounting rules will necessitate a change in in how we report goodwill on our balance sheet 
this may cause an impairment write down of our investment in cushman 
we have retained an independent firm to make a valuation of cushman to see if this step will be required 
until that valuation is received  we will not know the amount  if any of this write down 
if a write down is made  the amount of the write down will reduce the net income to be reported by the company in forward looking statements item business and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report contain forward looking statements of management 
in general  these are predictions or suggestions of future events and statements or expectations of future occurrences 
there are certain important risks that could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated by some of the forward looking statements 
some  but not all  of the important risks which could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements include  among other things o the recent downturn in the economy in the united states  as well as abroad  may cause our sales to decrease or not to increase 
o as a result of the terrorist activities on and after september   consumer buying habits could change and decrease our sales 
o if terrorists choose to target livestock in the united states or abroad for chemical  biological or other attacks  our sources of raw material and inventory could decrease  or these items could become more expensive 
o the prices of hides and leathers also fluctuate in normal times  and these fluctuations can affect the company 
o if  for whatever reason  the costs of our raw materials and inventory increase  we may not be able to pass those costs on to our customers  particularly if the economy has not recovered from its downturn 
o other factors could cause either fluctuations in buying patterns or possible negative trends in the craft and western retail markets 
in addition  our customers may change their preferences to products other than ours  or they may not accept new products as we introduce them 
o the company currently buys in countries around the world 
war  terrorism  changes in the internal affairs or international relations of these countries such as events that might affect their most favored nation status with the united states of america and other uncertainties can disrupt our purchases from abroad 
o we might fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the recent acquisition of the assets of tandy leather  the opening of tandy leather retail stores or other retail initiatives might not be successful 
o tax or interest rates might increase 
in particular  interest rates are likely to increase at some point from their present low levels 
these increases will increase our costs of borrowing funds as needed in our business 
o any change in the commercial banking environment may affect us and our ability to borrow capital as needed 
o other uncertainties  which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the company  may occur as well 
the company does not intend to update forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s credit facility includes loans with interest rates that vary with changes in the prime rate 
an increase of one percentage point in the prime rate would not have a material impact on the company s future earnings
