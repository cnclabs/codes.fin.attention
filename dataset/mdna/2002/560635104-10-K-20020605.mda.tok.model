through the remainder of fiscal  mesaba s jet flight activity gradually returned to levels that existed prior to september  while mesaba s jet prop fleet has remained at the level 
in addition  mesaba reduced the rates it charged northwest by for service from october through december  mesaba has partially compensated for the overall revenue decline of during the fiscal year ended march  by consistently achieving high levels of operating performance 
certain expenses of mesaba vary directly with the level of flight activity  such as fuel and certain costs of maintenance contracts 
other expenses are relatively fixed in nature and are incurred by mesaba regardless of the level of flight activity  such as aircraft rentals and depreciation and amortization 
the remaining expenses  such as wages and benefits and administrative and other  are variable in nature 
after september   management initiated various cost reduction programs to reduce mesaba s variable expenses to be more in line with the reduced operating revenues 
such programs included the completion of personnel reductions  vendor renegotiations and the elimination of certain discretionary expenditures 
however  certain expenses have increased substantially post september those costs include insurance  security and airport landing fees 
on september   president bush signed into law the air transportation safety and system stabilization act stabilization act

overall  personnel levels measured on a full time equivalent basis at the fiscal year end decreased to approximately  from  aircraft fuel costs decreased to million for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease is attributable to the reduced jet prop flight activity after september provisions of the airlink agreement with northwest protect mesaba from changes in fuel prices 
mesaba s actual cost of fuel  including taxes and pumping fees  was cents per gallon in fiscal and per the airlink agreement 
northwest provides fuel for the jet operation at its expense 
aircraft maintenance costs  excluding wages and benefits  decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to reduced fleet utilization after september  which lowered flight hour based maintenance costs 
the decrease was offset by an increase in rotable repair costs due to the aging of the fleet 
aircraft rents increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to the full year impact of the three additional rj aircraft that were delivered during the first quarter of fiscal  the addition of five saab aircraft that were received during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the return of three saab aircraft at the end of the third quarter of fiscal landing fees increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to higher landing fees charged by airports after september northwest provides landing fees for the jet operation at its expense

the stabilization act provides for direct cash grants to us airlines to compensate for direct and incremental losses as defined in the act and department of transportation instructions incurred from september   through december   and resulting from the attacks 
mesaba recognized a pre tax grant of approximately million as other nonoperating income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations in accordance with department of transportation and financial accounting standards board fasb guidance 
mesaba received approximately million in cash and has recorded the additional million within accounts receivable  net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of march  mesaba has applied to obtain the remaining million with the ultimate collection being subject to the approval by the department of transportation 
during september  mesaba initiated a reduction in personnel as a result of the impact of the terrorist attacks of september  mesaba recorded within administrative and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the second quarter of fiscal year a one time pre tax charge of approximately million to cover the expected severance and related costs 
the reduction in personnel was completed by september  and affected individuals in all areas of mesaba 
as of march   mesaba has paid and charged against the liability  and reduced the liability by approximately  during the third quarter due to the employment of certain terminated employees by others 
the remaining cost of approximately  is expected to be funded through a combination of cash from operations and available cash through september as of march   mesaba s fleet consisted of aircraft covered under operating leases with remaining terms of six months to years and aggregate monthly lease payments of approximately million 
operating leases have been mesaba s primary method of acquiring aircraft  and management expects to continue relying on this method to meet most of its future aircraft needs  including the addition over time of up to eleven saab b aircraft that will be serving the memphis hub 
mesaba leases all of its saab aircraft  either directly from aircraft leasing companies or through subleases with northwest under operating leases with original terms up to years 
mesaba leases its rj aircraft from northwest under operating leases with terms of up to years 
continued funding of the monthly minimum lease payments is ensured as long as the current operating contracts with northwest are in effect 
during june  mesaba entered into an agreement with the metropolitan airports commission mac to terminate the minneapolis st 
paul maintenance hangar and general office leases on january   to accommodate planned runway construction 
in october  mesaba received a notice from the mac informing mesaba that the lease termination date had been delayed to september mesaba expects to receive an early lease termination fee of million at that time and is accounting for this as a reduction to lease expense over the term of the agreement 
due to the lease termination agreement  the lease was reclassified from a capital to an operating lease in the first quarter of fiscal mesaba will relocate its hangar facilities to the west side of the airport and is currently evaluating future lease options with the mac 
during fiscal  mesaba committed to reconstruct its maintenance facility located at the detroit metropolitan airport 
the new facility reopened on june  and is approximately larger than the previous hangar  which experienced significant damage on may  due to severe weather 
mesaba has paid million as of march  for the additional space  which will not be covered by insurance proceeds 
the company maintains property and business interruption insurance coverage on its facilities 
on march   mesaba filed a lawsuit in minnesota state court against federal insurance company  a subsidiary of the chubb corporation  for coverage of the business interruption  extra expense and fire suppression equipment for the detroit hangar 
the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit cannot be predicted with certainty 
no amounts have been recorded under this lawsuit as of march  recovery amounts will be recorded upon resolution of the lawsuit 
approximately of mesaba s accounts receivable balance as of march  are due from northwest 
loss of mesaba s affiliation with northwest or northwest s failure to make timely payment of amounts owed to mesaba or to otherwise materially perform under the airlink or jet agreement for any reason would have a material adverse effect on the company s operations and financial results 
the company has historically relied upon cash and cash equivalents and investments and internally generated funds to support its working capital requirements 
management believes that funds from operations will provide adequate resources for meeting non aircraft capital needs in fiscal outlook management believes the economic forces and conditions that existed post september  are likely to persist throughout fiscal in fiscal  management expects to continue to concentrate on excellent operating performance  careful resource management and a new agreement with mesaba s pilots 
management believes the company is in a sound operating position at the beginning of fiscal with a cash  cash equivalent and investments balance of approximately million 
mesaba s asm s are expected to continue to rebound from the fiscal third quarter low with an expected three to five percent year over year growth 
operating expenses are expected to increase as well due primarily to the full year effect of the post september increased insurance and aircraft rental fees 
as a result  management expects the company will report a diluted earnings per share of to for fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
the us securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  the company has identified its critical accounting policies to include those discussed in the following paragraphs 
the company also has other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements for additional discussion of these items 
management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  based on information presently available  however  changes in these estimates  judgments and assumptions will occur as a result of future events  and accordingly actual results could differ from amounts estimated 
estimated lives are used to record depreciation on aircraft property and equipment 
aircraft utilization  technology  and changes in the business strategy may affect the economic lives used to record depreciation by mesaba 
the foregoing may also impact depreciation rates  impairment  or both 
mesaba s management regularly reviews the estimated useful lives and salvage values for mesaba s aircraft property and equipment 
estimated recovery percentages are used to record obsolescence reserves for parts inventories 
aircraft utilization  parts availability  and changes in parts cost may affect the valuation of parts inventories and obsolescence reserve levels 
mesaba s management regularly reviews recovery percentages  reserve levels and inventory valuations for parts inventories 
estimated maintenance costs and anticipated aircraft activity are used to determine maintenance reserves 
changes in maintenance contracts  parts and labor costs and aircraft activity may affect the maintenance reserves 
mesaba s management regularly reviews airplane activity  expected aircraft return dates  changes in its maintenance contracts and parts and labor costs for maintenance reserves 
new accounting pronouncements the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended on april  sfas no

will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal market risks are the availability of jet fuel and changes in interest rates 
the company has not experienced difficulties with fuel availability and expects to be able to obtain fuel at prevailing prices in quantities sufficient to meet its future requirements 
as a part of the airlink agreement  northwest bears the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations for mesaba s fuel requirements 
as such  the company reasonably expects that its results of operations will not be directly affected by fuel price volatility 
the company does not hold long term interest sensitive assets and therefore is not exposed to interest rate fluctuations for its assets 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes
