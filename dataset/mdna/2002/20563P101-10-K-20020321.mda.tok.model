item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company reported net income of million  or 
per diluted share for the year ended december   a decrease of compared to net income of million or per diluted share for the year ended december  the company s net income in was million  or per diluted share 
the continued weak economic conditions in the manufacturing sector in north america and europe had a significant impact on compx s results in in response to these conditions  compx reduced manufacturing fixed costs and other costs starting in the first quarter of and restructured its european operations in the fourth quarter of the cost reductions and restructuring efforts are designed to minimize the adverse effects of lower sales and more favorably position compx to meet demand when the economy recovers 
in  compx also entered into a sale leaseback transaction for its over year old facility in the netherlands which will provide the opportunity to move into more modern facilities 
looking forward  compx has stepped up efforts to increase sales outside of the office furniture industry and to seek ways to further reduce costs  including expanding its foreign sourcing of certain component products 
prior to the fourth quarter of  the company operated in one reportable segment the manufacture and sale of mechanically engineered components for office furniture and other markets 
during the fourth quarter of  the company implemented certain operational and other changes at all of its facilities  revising the company s organizational structure and causing the composition of the reportable segments to change 
the company now defines its operations in terms of three operating segments compx security products  compx waterloo and compx europe 
the compx security products segment  with manufacturing facilities in south carolina and illinois  manufactures locking mechanisms and other security products for sales to the office furniture  banking  vending  computer and other industries 
the compx waterloo segment  with facilities in canada  michigan and taiwan  and the compx europe segment  with facilities in the netherlands  both manufacture a complete line of precision ball bearing slides for use in office furniture  computer related equipment  tool storage cabinets and other applications 
both of these segments also either manufacture and or distribute ergonomic computer support systems 
because of the similar economic characteristics between the compx waterloo and compx europe segments and due to the identical products  customer types  production processes and distribution methods shared by these two segments  they have been aggregated into a single reportable segment for segment reporting purposes 
prior period segment information has been reclassified to reflect the new operating segments 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  beginning in the company will no longer recognize periodic amortization of goodwill in its results of operations 
the company would have reported net income of approximately million in  or about million higher than what was actually reported  if the goodwill amortization included in the company s reported net income had not been recognized 
of such million difference  approximately million and 
million relate to the company s compx security products and compx waterloo compx europe segments  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory reserves  the recoverability of other long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets and the realization of deferred income tax assets 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the critical financial statement judgment risks of its business are attributable to four primary areas 
o will customer accounts receivable on the books be collected at full book value o will inventory on hand be sold with a sufficient mark up to cover the cost to produce and ship the product o will future cash flows of the company be sufficient to recover the net book value of long term assets o will future taxable income be sufficient to utilize recorded deferred income tax assets the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates  as noted above  used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements o allowance for uncollectable accounts receivable 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company takes into consideration the current financial condition of the customers  the age of outstanding balances and the current economic environment when assessing the adequacy of the allowances 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  increased allowances may be required 
o inventory reserves 
the company provides reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
the company also considers the age and the quantity of inventory on hand in estimating the reserve 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  increased inventory reserves may be required 
o net book value of long term assets 
the company recognizes an impairment charge associated with its long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  whenever it determines that recovery of the long lived asset is not probable 
the determination is made in accordance with applicable gaap requirements associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
adverse changes in estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
o deferred income tax assets 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realizable under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
it is possible that in the future the company may change its estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized 
this would result in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period the change in estimate is made 
results of operations net sales and operating income years ended december  change in millions net sales compx waterloo compx europe segment compx security products segment total net sales operating income compx waterloo compx europe segment compx security products segment total operating income operating income margin compx waterloo compx europe segment compx security products segment year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales decreased million  or  in compared to due to decreased demand for the company s products resulting from the continued weak economic conditions in the manufacturing sector in north america and europe  and to a lesser extent  the negative effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
net sales of slide products in decreased as compared to  while net sales of security products and ergonomic products each decreased during the same period 
net sales of the compx security products segment decreased and net sales of the compx waterloo compx europe segment decreased in operating income for decreased million  or compared to and operating income margins decreased to in compared to for reductions in manufacturing  fixed overhead and related overhead costs  which began in the first quarter of  partially offset the effects of the decline in net sales in however  despite these cost reductions  operating margins in were adversely impacted by the decline in volume levels and the related impact on manufacturing efficiencies  the effects of unfavorable changes in the sales mix and general pricing pressures 
operating income at the compx waterloo compx europe segment decreased in compared to  while operating income at the compx security products segment decreased for the same period 
a pre tax million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of and a proportionately larger impact of unfavorable changes in the sales mix contributed to the more substantial operating income decline at the compx waterloo compx europe segment as compared to the compx security products segment 
the fourth quarter restructuring charge included headcount reductions of about employees at compx s maastricht  the netherlands facility  substantially all of which had been implemented by december  of the million charge  approximately 
million has been paid in  with million expected to be paid in the first two quarters of and 
million expected to be paid in in addition  approximately million in pre tax charges were recorded in the fourth quarter of this charge is predominately comprised of million related to various changes in estimates with respect to reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventory  approximately 
million related to allowances for doubtful accounts  with the remainder related to other items 
of the million charge  approximately 
million related to the compx waterloo compx europe segment with the remaining million related to the compx security products segment 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased million  or  in compared to due to the effect of acquisitions 
sales of security products in increased compared to  and sales of slide products increased 
during  sales of compx s ergonomic products decreased compared to net sales of the compx security products segment increased while net sales of the compx waterloo compx europe segment increased in excluding the effect of acquisitions  net sales in were essentially flat compared to  with sales of slide products up and sales of ergonomic products and security products down and  respectively 
excluding the effects of acquisitions  net sales of the compx waterloo compx europe segment increased and net sales at the compx security product segment decreased in as compared to sales of the compx waterloo compx europe segment were negatively impacted in the second half of by softening demand in the office furniture industry in north america and loss of market share due to competition from imports 
however  strong sales of slide products in the first part of  offset the softening office furniture industry demand  resulting in the overall increase in sales of this segment 
the lower compx security products segment sales were due to weakness in the computer and related products industry and increased competition from low cost imports 
operating income for decreased million  or compared to excluding the results of acquisitions  operating income decreased from the prior year 
operating income of the compx security products segment decreased in as compared to decreased excluding the results of acquisitions and declined at the compx waterloo compx europe segment decreased excluding the results of acquisitions during the same period 
along with the softening demand from the office furniture industry  operating income was also impacted by a change in the product mix  with a lower percentage of sales being generated by certain higher margin products in compared to  as well as incremental costs incurred in moving the operations of the chicago lock plant to the company s mauldin  south carolina plant  higher costs associated with the expansion of the company s byron center  michigan plant and higher administrative expenses 
general the company expanded its offerings in the precision ball bearing slide and ergonomic products markets in through its acquisitions of thomas regout for approximately million and dynaslide for approximately million 
in january  the company acquired substantially all of the operating assets of chicago lock company for approximately million  further expanding its security products capacity 
these acquisitions were financed through a combination of cash on hand and increased borrowings under the company s revolving senior credit facility 
the company s profitability primarily depends on its ability to utilize its production capacity effectively  which is affected by  among other things  the demand for its products  and its ability to control its manufacturing costs  primarily comprised of raw materials such as zinc  copper  coiled steel and plastic resins and of labor costs 
raw material costs represent approximately of the company s total cost of sales 
in through  steel prices did not change significantly compared to the respective prior years 
the company occasionally enters into raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in raw material costs 
while these arrangements do not commit the company to a minimum volume of purchases  they generally provide for stated unit prices based upon achievement of specified volume purchase levels 
this allows the company to stabilize raw material purchase prices provided the specified minimum monthly purchase quantities are met 
the company entered into such arrangements for zinc  coiled steel and plastic resins in and does not anticipate significant changes in the cost of these materials from their current levels 
materials purchased on the spot market are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases 
due to the competitive nature of the markets served by the company s products  it is often difficult to recover such increases in raw material costs through increased product selling prices and consequently overall operating margins may be affected by such raw material cost pressures 
at december   none of the company s employees in the us  the netherlands or taiwan were represented by bargaining units  and wage increases for such employees historically have been in line with overall inflation indices 
approximately of the company s canadian employees are covered by a three year collective bargaining agreement that expires in and provides for annual wage increases of approximately 
wage increases for these canadian employees historically have also been in line with overall inflation indices 
selling  general and administrative costs consist primarily of salaries  commissions and advertising expenses directly related to product sales and in through have been consistent as a percentage of net sales 
compx has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states principally in canada  the netherlands and taiwan 
a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the canadian dollar  the dutch guilder  the euro and the new taiwan dollar 
in addition  a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations principally in canada are denominated in the us dollar 
most raw materials  labor and other production costs for such non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of compx s foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
during  weakness primarily in the euro and canadian dollar negatively impacted the company s sales comparisons with principally with respect to slide products 
operating income comparisons for this period  however  were not materially impacted by the effects of currency 
excluding the effect of currency  the company s sales decreased in compared to and sales of the compx waterloo compx europe segment decreased for the same period 
in  excluding the effects of currency and acquisitions  the company s sales increased compared to  and operating income decreased 
sales of the compx waterloo compx europe segment increased and operating income decreased  exclusive of the effects of currency and acquisitions 
the effects of currency fluctuations do not materially affect the compx security products segment 
interest expense interest expense increased 
million in compared to due primarily to higher average levels of outstanding indebtedness on compx s revolving senior credit facility 
likewise  interest expense increased 
million in compared to due to increased borrowings partially offset by lower rates 
assuming interest rates do not increase significantly from year end levels  interest expense in is expected to be somewhat lower compared to due to anticipated debt reduction in using available cash on hand 
provision for income taxes the principal reasons for the difference between compx s effective income tax rates and the us federal statutory income tax rates are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income tax rates vary by jurisdiction county and or state  and relative changes in the geographic mix of compx s pre tax earnings can result in fluctuations in the effective income tax rate 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  effective january   the company will no longer recognize periodic amortization of goodwill 
under gaap  generally there is no income tax benefit recognized for financial reporting purposes attributable to goodwill amortization 
accordingly  ceasing to periodically amortize goodwill beginning in will result in a reduction in the company s overall effective income tax rate in as compared to other as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements  other general corporate income  net primarily includes interest income and net foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
interest income increased in compared to due primarily to a higher level of funds available for investment 
conversely  interest income decreased when compared to due to lower levels of available funds for investment 
in  a curtailment gain of approximately 
million was included in other general corporate income  net 
this curtailment gain  more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  relates to the cessation of benefits provided under compx s defined benefit plan which covered substantially all full time employees of thomas regout bv as of december   certain obligations related to the terminated plan had not yet been fully settled and are reflected in accrued pension costs 
compx expects to report a 
million settlement gain in also reflected in the results of operations is a million gain on the sale leaseback of the company s facility in the netherlands  which is discussed more fully below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
related party transactions compx is a party to certain transactions with related parties 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
outlook the company expects the weak economic conditions experienced in to continue to have significant impact on its results for although some recent economic data shows positive signs  it is still too early to determine the pace and extent of a recovery that might occur in additionally  a significant portion of compx s revenue is derived from the office furniture industry and the office furniture industry tends to lag in its recovery behind the rest of the economy 
given the uncertainty of the economic conditions  the company continues to balance its focus on opportunities outside of the office furniture industry as well as continuing to drive operational efficiency through cost improvement initiatives and prudent balance sheet management 
these measures are designed to minimize the adverse effect of lower furniture industry sales and more favorably position the company to meet demand when the economy recovers 
additionally  the periodic amortization of goodwill will no longer impact operating results beginning in liquidity and capital resources consolidated cash flows operating activities 
trends in cash flows from operating activities  excluding changes in assets and liabilities and non cash stock award charges  for  and  are generally similar to the trends in the company s earnings 
cash provided by operating activities totaled  million  million and million for the years ended december   and respectively  compared to net income of million  million and million  respectively 
depreciation and amortization increased during each of the past three years in part due to the acquisitions discussed above and additional expenditures on facilities expansion discussed below 
changes in assets and liabilities result primarily from the timing of production  sales and purchases 
such changes in assets and liabilities generally tend to even out over time and result in trends in cash flows from operating activities generally reflecting earnings trends 
investing activities 
net cash used by investing activities totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash used by investing activities in includes million in cash for the thomas regout and dynaslide acquisitions and approximately million in for the chicago lock acquisition 
in  million in cash was provided from the sale leaseback of the company s plant facility in the netherlands 
other cash flows from investing activities in each of the past three years related principally to capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in the past three years emphasized manufacturing equipment which utilizes new technologies and increases automation of the manufacturing process to provide for increased productivity and efficiency 
capital expenditures in relates primarily to the additions of a fourth plating line at the company s kitchener facility  facility expansions in kitchener  the acquisition of an adjoining manufacturing building at fort lock and the addition of automation equipment at all facilities 
the capital expenditures in and relate primarily to the completion of the facility expansions mentioned above and additional facility expansions at the company s byron center and mauldin facilities 
pursuant to the sale leaseback of the company s plant facility in maastricht  the netherlands  compx sold the manufacturing facility with a net carrying value of million for million cash consideration in december  and compx simultaneously entered into a leaseback of the facility with a nominal monthly rental for approximately months 
compx has the option to extend the leaseback period for up to an additional two years with monthly rentals of  to  compx may terminate the leaseback at any time without penalty 
in addition to the cash received up front  compx included an estimate of the fair market value of the monthly rental during the nominal rental leaseback period as part of the sale proceeds 
a portion of the gain from the sale of the facility after transaction costs  equal to the present value of the monthly rentals over the expected leaseback period including the fair market value of the monthly rental during the nominal rental leaseback period  has been deferred and will be amortized into income over the expected leaseback period 
compx will recognize rental expense over the leaseback period  including amortization of the prepaid rent consisting of the estimated fair market value of the monthly rental during the nominal rental leaseback period 
pursuant to the agreement  compx is also obligated to acquire approximately acres from the municipality of maastricht for approximately million within the next one to three years 
capital expenditures for are estimated at approximately million  the majority of which relate to projects that emphasize improved production efficiency and shifting production capacity to lower cost facilities 
firm purchase commitments for capital projects in process at december  approximated million 
financing activities 
net cash provided by used in financing activities totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company paid its first regular quarterly dividend since the initial public offering of per share in december total cash dividends paid in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the company s board of directors has authorized the company to purchase up to approximately million shares of its common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions at unspecified prices and over an unspecified period of time 
as of december   the company had purchased approximately  shares for an aggregate of million pursuant to such authorization million for  shares in and million for  shares in 
at december   the company had million of borrowing availability under its revolving senior credit facility  which expires in february provisions contained in compx s credit agreement could result in the acceleration of the indebtedness prior to its stated maturity for reasons other than defaults from failing to comply with typical financial covenants 
for example  the company s credit agreement allows the lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness upon a change of control as defined of the borrower 
the terms of compx s credit agreement could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of the indebtedness following a sale of assets outside of the ordinary course of business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other than certain operating leases discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  neither compx nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliates are parties to any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
other management believes that cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under the revolving senior credit facility  together with cash on hand  will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity needs for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and dividends 
to the extent that actual developments differ from the company s expectations  compx s liquidity could be adversely affected 
the company periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and available resources in view of  among other things  its capital expenditure requirements in light of its capital resources and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  the company has in the past and may in the future seek to raise additional capital  refinance or restructure indebtedness  issue additional securities  repurchase shares of its common stock  modify its dividend policy or take a combination of such steps to manage its liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  the company may review opportunities for acquisitions  joint ventures or other business combinations in the component products industry 
in the event of any such transaction  the company may consider using available cash  issuing additional equity securities or increasing the indebtedness of the company or its subsidiaries 
contractual obligations 
as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company is obligated to make future payments under certain debt and lease agreements  and is a party to other commitments 
the following table summarizes these obligations as of december  payments due by period less than total year years years in thousands long term debt   capital lease obligations operating leases   unconditional purchase obligations   other long term obligation maastricht real estate acquisition obligation   total contractual cash obligations    in addition  the company is a party to certain other agreements that contractually and unconditionally commit the company to pay certain amounts in the future 
while the company believes it is probable that amounts will be spent in the future under such contracts  the amount and or the timing of such future payments will vary depending on certain provisions of the applicable contract 
agreements to which the company is a party that fall into this category  more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  are compx s patent license agreements under which it pays royalties based on the volume of certain products manufactured in canada and sold in the united states 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company periodically uses currency forward contracts to manage a portion of foreign exchange rate risk associated with receivables  or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales  denominated in a currency other than the holder s functional currency 
otherwise  the company does not generally enter into forward or option contracts to manage such market risks  nor does the company enter into any such contract or other type of derivative instrument for trading or speculative purposes 
other than the contracts discussed below  the company was not a party to any forward or derivative option contract related to foreign exchange rates or interest rates at december  and see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december  and  substantially all of the company s outstanding indebtedness were variable rate borrowings 
such borrowings at december  related principally to million million at december  in borrowings under the revolving senior credit facility 
the outstanding balances at december  and which approximate fair value had a weighted average interest rate of and  respectively 
amounts outstanding under this credit facility are due in the remaining indebtedness outstanding at december  and is not material 
foreign currency exchange rates 
the company is exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling its products outside the united states principally canada  western europe and taiwan 
a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the non us dollar  principally the canadian dollar  the euro and the new taiwan dollar 
in addition  a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations principally in canada are denominated in the us dollar 
most raw materials  labor and other production costs for such non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of compx s foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
certain of compx s sales generated by its canadian operations are denominated in us dollars 
to manage a portion of the foreign exchange rate market risk associated with receivables  or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales  at december  compx had entered into a series of short term forward exchange contracts maturing through march to exchange an aggregate of million for an equivalent amount of canadian dollars at an exchange rate of cdn per us dollar 
at each balance sheet date  outstanding currency forward contracts are marked to market with any resulting gain or loss recognized in income currently 
the difference between the estimated fair value and the face value of all such outstanding forward contracts at december  is not material 
no foreign exchange contracts were outstanding at december  other 
beginning january   eleven of the fifteen members of the european union eu  including the netherlands  adopted a new european currency unit the euro as their common legal currency 
following the introduction of the euro  the participating countries national currencies remained legal tender as denominations of the euro from january  through january   and the exchange rates between the euro and such national currency units are fixed 
during  the functional currencies of the company s thomas regout operations in maastricht  the netherlands  completed the conversion to the euro from its national currency 
the euro conversion did not materially impact the company s operations 
the above discussion includes forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by the company of future events or losses 
such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties some of which are listed in business general
