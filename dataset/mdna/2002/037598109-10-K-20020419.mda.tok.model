item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction apogee enterprises  inc is a world leader in technologies involving the design and development of value added glass products  services and systems 
we are organized in three segments 
the architectural products and services segment architectural designs  engineers  fabricates  installs  services and renovates the walls of glass and windows comprising the outside skin of commercial and institutional buildings 
the businesses in this segment include viracon  the leading fabricator of coated  high performance architectural glass for global markets  harmon  inc  the largest us full service building and glass installation  maintenance  and renovation company  wausau window wall systems  a manufacturer of custom  aluminum windows and curtainwall systems  and linetec  a high performance paint and anodizing finisher 

large scale optical technologies segment lso develops and produces high technology glass that enhances the visual performance of products for the display  imaging and picture framing industries 
the businesses in this segment include tru vue  a north american value added glass and matboard manufacturer for the custom framing and pre framed art markets  and viratec thin films  a producer of optical thin film coatings for the global display and imaging markets 

automotive replacement glass and services segment auto glass fabricates  repairs and replaces automobile windshields and windows 
the businesses in this segment include harmon autoglass  a us chain of retail auto glass replacement and repair stores  and viracon curvlite  a us fabricator of aftermarket foreign and domestic car windshields 
performance the relationship between various components of operations  stated as a percent of net sales  is illustrated below for the past three fiscal years 
percent of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense  net equity in loss income of affiliated companies earnings from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes earnings from continuing operations earnings from discontinued operations  net net earnings fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales decreased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal net sales decreased compared to the prior year  after being adjusted for the july formation of ppg auto glass  llc ppg auto glass joint venture 
the results of the auto glass distribution unit  which we contributed to the joint venture  were not included in our continuing operations in fiscal  as they were through the second quarter of fiscal the remaining net decrease is attributable to volume reductions and lower pricing from competitive pressures in the auto glass segment and slowdown in the markets served by the lso segment 
these reductions were partially offset by increased revenues in our architectural segment due to increased volume and more efficient and effective operations 
additionally  fiscal comprised of weeks versus weeks in fiscal on a consolidated basis  cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  fell to for fiscal  improving from in fiscal the primary factors were efficiencies gained in our architectural segment  as well as cost reductions and sales of higher margin product mix in that segment 
these improvements impacted margin by 
the net of the formation of the ppg auto glass joint venture and pricing amendments to the ppg auto glass supply agreements made during the second quarter of fiscal increased margins by 
these increases were offset by significant margin reductions within the lso segment 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  as a percentage of sales  increased to from  but decreased million 
key components attributable to the decline in sg a expenses were reductions in depreciation  and salaries and related costs in the auto glass segment to reduce its overall cost structure 
these declines were partially offset by increased performance based incentive expenses and training costs 
net interest expense decreased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal reflecting significantly lower borrowing levels and a lower weighted average interest rate under the revolving credit agreement 
also contributing to this decrease were interest components of tax refunds received during the year 
our equity in loss from affiliated companies was million in fiscal versus equity in income of million in the prior year 
the amendments made to the supply agreements related to the ppg auto glass joint venture in the current year second quarter led to lower earnings during the year for ppg auto glass 
this decline was somewhat offset by lower costs at the terrasun joint venture  which was shut down during the third quarter of fiscal our effective income tax rate of of pre tax earnings from continuing operations decreased from the of pre tax earnings from continuing operations reported in fiscal this reduction was due to a decrease in tax reserves as a result of the closure of certain tax periods and due to the relationship of permanent book and tax differences 
our fiscal earnings from continuing operations increased to million or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to earnings from continuing operations of million  or diluted earnings per share  a year earlier 
the increase in earnings is largely attributable to the revenue and productivity gains within our architectural segment  a reduced cost structure in the auto glass related businesses  and lower interest and taxes  offset by losses in our lso segment 
we did not report earnings from operations of discontinued businesses in fiscal in fiscal  we reported earnings from operations of discontinued businesses of million after tax  or diluted earnings per share 
our fiscal net earnings were million  or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to million  or diluted earnings per share  a year ago 
segment analysis architectural products and services in thousands net sales    operating income    depreciation and amortization    capital expenditures    assets    architectural net sales for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the increase is due to an increase in the number of curtainwall installation projects  due to the new renovation initiatives and growth at new and mature shops  and improved operations allowing for more capacity and shipments at our window systems and curtainwall manufacturing business 
operating income for the segment in fiscal increased to million from million in the prior year 
the resultant operating margins increased to for fiscal from in fiscal the majority of the improvement in operating income was driven by sales mix changes to higher margin products and efficiencies in manufacturing in glass fabricating  partially offset by slightly lower margins in installation 
the segment s depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures remained flat for the period compared to prior year 
total assets at the end of fiscal were consistent with those at the end of fiscal large scale optical technologies in thousands net sales    operating loss income   depreciation and amortization    capital expenditures    assets    lso net sales of million decreased over fiscal the decrease in net sales and resulting operating loss were a direct result of the severe downturn in the pc industry and the slowdown in retail framing markets  along with the closure of the san diego facility during the first quarter of the year 
lso reported an operating loss of million for fiscal  compared to operating income of million for fiscal depreciation and amortization decreased to million for fiscal from million for the prior year due to sale and leaseback agreements entered into on certain production equipment during fiscal the leases are accounted for as operating leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
capital expenditures for fiscal year were million compared to million in fiscal total assets decreased to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal this decrease is attributable to the sale of assets from the shutdown of the san diego facility  and an overall reduction in working capital requirements due to the slowdown 
automotive replacement glass and services in thousands net sales    operating income   depreciation and amortization    capital expenditures    assets    auto glass net sales decreased to million in fiscal segment revenues  which declined compared to fiscal after being adjusted for the ppg auto glass joint venture  decreased due to reduced retail unit volumes from loss of market share and lower prices as a result of competitive pricing pressures 
market data indicates that unit demand for replacement auto glass in the us increased during fiscal auto glass operating income increased to million for fiscal from operating income of million in fiscal due to a combination of improvements in the retail business and changes in ppg auto glass supply agreements 
approximately of the operating income improvement resulted from amendments made to the supply agreements related to the ppg auto glass joint venture  effective beginning the second quarter of this year 
these amendments permanently adjusted pricing to the joint venture from our windshield manufacturing business  resulting in higher income for the segment 
the remaining gains were the result of operational improvements and cost reductions implemented late fiscal for retail 
at the end of fiscal  auto glass had harmon autoglass retail locations and co branded facilities 
the segment continues to pursue opportunities to increase utilization and improve efficiencies 
depreciation and amortization decreased to million for fiscal from million for the prior year 
this is the result of certain significant computer hardware and software applications becoming fully depreciated during fiscal capital expenditures for fiscal year were million compared to million in fiscal total assets decreased to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal this decrease is attributable to the reduction of distribution business assets not included in the contribution to the ppg auto glass joint venture 
we sold certain remaining assets and realized the reduction of working capital assets 
in addition  there were reductions in working capital requirements due to reductions of receivables in the retail business 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the results of the auto glass distribution unit  which apogee contributed to the ppg auto glass joint venture  were not included in apogee s continuing operations for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  as they were through the second quarter of fiscal fiscal revenues grew compared to the prior year after being adjusted for the formation of the joint venture 
the majority of the increase is attributable to increased unit production due to the full year impact of plant expansions completed during fiscal  enhanced equipment utilization and the impact of fiscal year acquisitions 
additionally  fiscal comprised of weeks while fiscal comprised of weeks 
on a consolidated basis  cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  fell to for fiscal  improving from in fiscal the primary factors underlying the resulting increase in gross profit percentage were improved performance attributable to enhanced manufacturing performance within the architectural and large scale optical segments  as well as cost reduction initiatives within the automotive replacement glass segment 
these improvements were partially offset by higher general liability and health insurance related expenses across all segments 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  as a percentage of sales  decreased to from 
after being adjusted for the formation of the ppg auto glass joint venture  sg a expenses decreased  as a percentage of sales  from in fiscal the primary factor for the decrease was due to the cost reduction initiatives implemented at the automotive replacement glass segment  as well as reductions in expenses related to doubtful accounts across all segments 
these were offset by increases in amounts expensed for bonuses and incentives 
net interest expense rose slightly to million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase reflected higher weighted average interest rates under the company s revolving credit agreement 
this was somewhat offset by lower average borrowing levels during fiscal as compared to fiscal apogee s equity in income from affiliated companies was million in fiscal compared to equity in loss from affiliated companies of million a year ago 
income associated with the company s ppg auto glass joint venture  including rationalization and other transaction related adjustments  was offset by the company s terrasun research and development joint venture 
the ppg auto glass joint venture formed on july   combined the company s and ppg industries  inc s ppg us automotive replacement glass distribution businesses into a newly formed entity  ppg auto glass  with the company having a ownership interest in the joint venture 
fiscal results were largely attributable to terrasun 
apogee s effective income tax rate of of pre tax earnings from continuing operations decreased from the of pre tax earnings from continuing operations reported in fiscal this reduction is due to the relationship of book and tax differences as a percentage of pre tax income 
apogee s fiscal earnings from continuing operations increased to million or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to earnings from continuing operations of million  or diluted earnings per share  a year earlier 
the company reported earnings from operations of discontinued businesses of million after tax  or diluted earnings per share for fiscal as compared to million after tax  or diluted earnings per share  a year earlier 
apogee s fiscal net earnings were million  or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to million  or diluted earnings per share  a year ago 
the return on average shareholders equity was fiscal versus for fiscal segment analysis architectural products and services 
architectural net sales for fiscal increased over fiscal viracon reported an increase in net sales of  mostly due to the increased capacity from the full year impact associated with the completion of the statesboro facility 
additionally  strong customer demand for viracon s high performance architectural glass products significantly improved sales volume 
harmon  inc  reported a increase in net sales  primarily due to an increased number of curtainwall installation projects and linetec improved sales by 
these increases were offset by a slowdown in shipments at wausau window wall systems due to the facility not being able to fill its available short lead time capacity during the second half of the year 
operating income for the segment of million represented an increase of over prior year 
this was the result of increased production capacity and improved utilization at viracon as well as increased earnings at harmon  inc and linetec 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in earnings at wausau window wall systems 
the architectural segment backlog  at march   remained at record levels of million  compared to million at february  large scale optical technologies 
lso net sales of million represented a increase over fiscal tru vue reported a improvement in sales due to increased demand for their high margin  value added glass products 
additionally  tru vue expanded its pre framed art business through the acquisitions of balangier fine art and designs  and corporate art services  inc these acquisitions represent of the tru vue increase for fiscal sales 
viratec reported a net sales increase of over fiscal levels due to strong operational improvement that allowed for significant volume growth 
lso operating income of million for fiscal compared favorably to an operating loss of million for fiscal the increase was the result of the increased sales volume at both of the segment s operations as well as the impact of sales of higher margin products from tru vue and improved equipment utilization at viratec 
these increases were offset by acquisition related integration costs at tru vue and the impact of shutdown costs for viratec s san diego facility 
the shut down of the san diego facility will not have a material impact on next year s financial results 
automotive replacement glass and services 
auto glass net sales decreased to million in fiscal fiscal revenues for the segment grew compared to the prior year after being adjusted for the formation of the ppg auto glass joint venture 
net sales of the auto glass retail unit decreased compared with those of a year ago due  in part  to soft demand for auto replacement glass services 
the retail unit volume decrease was offset by unit price increases 
market data indicates that unit demand for replacement auto glass in the us rose during fiscal in an effort to improve margins  harmon autoglass closed retail facilities and implemented strategies to reduce low margin business 
this resulted in a reduction in volume of 
auto glass operating income increased to million for fiscal from operating income of million in fiscal during fiscal  as part of the company s initiative to maintain customer service and reduce costs  harmon autoglass reduced headcount through position eliminations  closed underperforming stores  or nearly of its retail locations  and transitioned call center operations to apac customer services  inc harmon autoglass continued to maintain a presence in most markets where shop closings occurred 
viracon curvlite reported slightly increased operating income over the prior year 
at the end of fiscal  auto glass had harmon autoglass retail locations and co branded facilities 
the segment continues to explore opportunities to increase utilization and improve efficiencies 
related party transactions as a result of our interest in ppg auto glass of which ppg has the remaining interest  various contracts and transactions the company enters into with ppg auto glass are deemed to be related party transactions 
under the terms of this multi year agreement  the company s retail auto glass business is committed to purchasing at least of its replacement windshield needs from ppg auto glass 
the terms are negotiated on an arms length basis 
we believe that the amounts received from or paid for such transactions represent the amounts that would normally be received  or paid to unrelated third parties for similar transactions 
discontinued operations during fiscal  the company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of vis n service corporation vis n  a non auto glass focused  third party administered claims processor  in two separate transactions with no impact to net earnings 
in fiscal  the company completed the sale of of the stock of its large scale domestic curtainwall business  harmon  ltd 
the sale of harmon  ltd 
and the company s detention security business in fiscal  combined with the fiscal exit from international curtainwall operations effectively removed the company from the large scale construction business 
all of the above mentioned businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements and notes 
prior periods have been restated 
at march   accruals totaling million represented the remaining estimated future cash outflows associated with the exit from discontinued operations 
the majority of these cash expenditures are expected to be made within the next two to three years 
the primary components of the accrual relate to the remaining exit costs from the international curtainwall operations of our large scale construction business  legal costs and other costs associated with the proceedings noted above 
the long term elements within the accrual related to the international curtainwall operations include bonds outstanding of which the precise degree of liability related to these matters will not be known until they are settled within the uk and french courts  and product liability issues  consisting of warranty and rework issues on these international construction projects 
recently issued accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
regarding accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
and no 
 establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet either as an asset or liability measured at fair value 
sfas no 
requires changes in the derivative s fair value to be recognized in earnings or  for derivatives that hedge market risk related to future cash flows  in accumulated other comprehensive loss income  unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the company adopted sfas no 
on march  and determined its derivative instruments  consisting of interest rate swap agreements  qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
the adoption resulted in the company recording the fair value of its interest rate swap agreements as a liability for million with an offsetting adjustment to other comprehensive earnings  net of tax  of million 
the net present liability associated with these interest rate swap agreements was million at march  in june  fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
under sfas no 
 amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will cease and instead the carrying value of these assets will be evaluated for impairment by applying a fair value based test on at least an annual basis 
we must adopt sfas no 
on march  and we are currently evaluating the effects adoption will have on our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill amortization expense recorded during fiscal was million 
in august  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  will be adopted on march   with no impact on our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources in thousands  except percentages cash provided by operations   capital expenditures   proceeds from dispositions of property   payments on long term debt  net   debt to invested capital operating activities 
cash provided by continuing operating activities of million decreased by million compared to last year 
this is the result of increasing working capital by million versus a reduction of million in fiscal net income plus noncash charges was essentially flat compared to the prior year 
investing activities 
fiscal investing activities used cash of million as compared to million of cash provided in fiscal as a result of the receipt of million related to a sales and leaseback transaction of operating equipment in the prior year 
new capital investment in fiscal totaled million  versus million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decreases over the past two years are the result of completing and starting up the significant projects initiated over the preceding two years 
in fiscal  the company expects to incur capital expenditures as necessary to maintain existing facilities and information systems 
fiscal expenditures are expected to be less than million 
in fiscal  the company had proceeds on the sale of certain land  buildings and equipment totaling million compared to million in fiscal included in the fiscal and fiscal amounts were sales and leaseback agreements on miscellaneous equipment totaling million and million  respectively 
we are not expecting to have any such agreements for fiscal financing activities 
payments on long term debt decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal we continued to focus on debt reduction during fiscal  evidenced by the reduction in our debt to invested capital percentage  which improved to at the end of fiscal from at the end of fiscal long term debt  including current installments of million  stood at million at march  compared to million at march  the majority of our long term debt at the end of the year  million  consisted of bank borrowings under a syndicated revolving credit facility 
other financing activities future cash payments due by period in thousands after long term debt   operating leases undiscounted    other obligations total cash obligations    for fiscal  we expect that outstanding borrowings will generally decline over the course of the year 
we believe that current cash on hand  cash generated from operating activities  and the available credit facility should be adequate to fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures through fiscal if we are unable to generate enough cash through operations to satisfy our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures  we have available funds from our syndicated revolving credit facility 
on march   we had a total of million available under the syndicated revolving credit facility of which million was in use 
this facility  which expires in may  permits borrowing at competitive interest rates and is available for general corporate purposes 
during fiscal  we reduced the credit facility from million to million 
during fiscal  we reduced the credit facility from million to million 
our receivables  inventory  equipment and intangibles secure the credit facility 
based upon our satisfaction of certain financial covenants during fiscal  we have the right to cause this security interest to be released upon our request 
at march   we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the credit facility 
in april  we expect to enter into a new  four year  unsecured  committed credit facility in the amount of million 
this credit facility will require us to maintain levels of net worth and certain financial ratios 
these ratios include maintaining an interest coverage ratio ebitda divided by interest expense of more than and a debt to ebitda ratio of less than at march   these ratios were and  respectively 
if we are not in compliance with these ratios at the end of any quarter  the debt can be accelerated 
upon establishment of this new credit facility  the parties to the previously existing million secured credit facility are expected to agree to terminate the previously existing credit facility 
during fiscal  million of variable rate industrial revenue bonds were issued and the resulting proceeds were loaned to us to finance a portion of our capital projects in faribault  mn and mccook  il 
in april  an additional million of variable rate industrial bonds were issued and the resulting proceeds were loaned to the company to finance a portion of our capital projects in wausau  wi 
in fiscal  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which expires in fiscal  that effectively converted million of variable rate borrowings into a fixed rate obligation 
in fiscal  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which expires in fiscal  which effectively converted million of variable rate borrowings into a fixed rate obligation 
during fiscal  we extended each of these swap agreements one year and modified the fixed rate obligation 
we experienced a material increase in our risk retention for our third party product liability coverages effective for fiscal a material rework event would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
from time to time  we acquire the use of certain assets  such as warehouses  automobiles  forklifts  trucks  office equipment and some manufacturing equipment through operating leases 
many of these operating leases have termination penalties 
however  because the assets are used in the conduct of our business operations  it is unlikely that any significant portion of these operating leases would be terminated prior to the normal expiration of their lease terms 
therefore  we consider the risk related to termination penalties to be minimal 
outlook overall revenue growth for fiscal versus fiscal is anticipated to be flat to low single digits  with year on year growth occurring in the second half 
architectural segment is expected to have flat to low single digit revenue growth for the year  with second half growth dependent on an improving construction industry 
the segment s focus on complex  value added projects results in longer lead times from project approval to production  creating the temporary softness moving from the fourth quarter of fiscal into the first quarter of fiscal lso segment revenues are expected to grow in the high single digits  driven by the timing of improvements in retail consumer electronics and framing markets and the expected success of new product initiatives 
automotive replacement glass segment revenues are expected to be approximately flat  as single digit windshield volume growth is slightly offset by customer mix and competitive pricing 
volume growth will be driven by improving industry conditions and retail s ability to gain market share 
gross margin percentages are expected to improve slightly  with operating efficiencies achieved largely through six sigma and other process improvement initiatives  which should offset increases in wages  health care and insurance costs 
at the same time  there is expected to be increased margin pressure in the architectural and auto glass segments driven by competitive actions in soft markets 
selling  general and administrative expenses will grow slightly  as will the amount as a percent of sales  due to investments in marketing and information technology initiatives 
earnings per share are expected to grow  with the year on year growth anticipated to begin starting in the third quarter when the improving economy should positively impact apogee s value added architectural and lso businesses 
critical accounting policies management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements and related notes and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate 
we believe that the most critical accounting policies applied in the presentation of our financial statements relate to accounting for contingencies  under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
contingencies  by their nature  relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss 
the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are as follows collectibility of accounts receivable we establish allowances for doubtful accounts for specifically identified  as well as anticipated  doubtful accounts based on credit profiles of our customers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions  and historical payment experience 
we feel that there is no concentration of credit risk due to the diversity of our markets  channels of distribution  and the geographic location of customers 
disputes and claims regarding product liability and warranties occasionally  we are subject to claims associated with our products and services  principally as a result of disputes with our customers involving our architectural products 
the time period from when a claim is asserted to when it is resolved either by dismissal  negotiation  settlement  or litigation can be several years 
additionally  while we maintain product liability insurance  the arrangements include significant self retention of risk in the form of policy deductibles 
in addition  certain claims could be determined to be uninsured 
we accrue based on our estimates of known claims  as well as anticipated claims for possible product warranty and rework costs 
discontinued operations we accrue for the remaining estimated future cash outflows associated with the exit from discontinued operations 
the majority of these cash expenditures are expected to be made within the next two to three years 
the primary components of the accrual relate to the remaining exit costs from the international curtainwall operations of our large scale construction business 
these long term accruals include settlement of the outstanding bonds  of which the precise degree of liability related to these matters will not be known until they are settled within the uk and french courts  and product liability issues and legal costs may be incurred  as they relate to our warranties and possible rework issues on the international and domestic construction projects 
self insurance reserves we obtain substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential losses for general liability  workers compensation and automobile liability risk 
however  an amount of risk is retained on a self insured basis through a wholly owned insurance subsidiary 
reserve requirements are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses 
taxes we estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we include differences between our deferred tax assets and tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
significant judgement is required in determining our provisions for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred tax assets 
as part of our ongoing financial reporting process  a collaborative effort is undertaken involving apogee managers with financial responsibility for financial reporting  credit  product and project management  quality  legal  and tax and outside advisors such as consultants  engineers  lawyers and actuaries 
the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these contingencies and develop the estimates used to prepare the financial statements 
we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial statements related to these contingencies are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate apogee management 
however  outcomes could differ from our estimates and could materially adversely affect our future operating results  financial position and cash flows 
impact of inflation our financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis  which does not completely account for the effects of inflation 
the cost of uncoated glass  one of our primary raw materials  was slightly higher as compared to the prior year as our vendors were able to pass on the impact of higher natural gas costs for part of the year 
in the case of our glass fabrication unit  we were able to pass a portion of this cost onto our customers so there was relatively no impact 
we expect the cost of glass to be flat or increase slightly in fiscal while our construction and supply contracts are at fixed prices  the material components are usually based on firm quotes obtained from suppliers 
labor costs  including taxes and fringe benefits  rose in fiscal and a moderate increase also can be anticipated for fiscal while these and other inflationary and market pressures on costs are expected in fiscal  we anticipate that ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and reductions in overhead will mitigate the negative effect of inflation and selling prices on fiscal operating income 
market risks our principal market risk is sensitivity to interest rates  which is the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce net earnings of the company 
to manage our direct risk from changes in market interest rates  management actively monitors the interest sensitive components of our balance sheet  primarily debt obligations  as well as market interest rates in order to minimize the impact of changes in interest rates on net earnings and cash flow 
we use interest swaps to fix a portion of our variable rate borrowings from fluctuations in interest rates 
as of march   we had interest swaps covering million of variable rate debt 
the net present liability associated with these swaps is million at the end of fiscal the primary measure of interest rate risk is the simulation of net income under different interest rate environments 
the approach used to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis 
this approach calculates the impact on net earnings  relative to a base case scenario  of rates increasing or decreasing gradually over the next months by basis points 
this change in interest rates affecting our financial instruments would result in approximately a million impact to net earnings 
as interest rates increase  net earnings decrease  as interest rates decrease  net earnings increase 
we have a policy of using forward exchange contracts to hedge our net exposures  by currency  related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities  and future firm commitments of our operations 
forward exchange contracts are also used from time to time to manage near term foreign currency cash requirements 
the primary objective of these hedging activities is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes  net of related tax effects  are minimized 
as of march   we had million of forward contracts outstanding 
a adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in exchange losses from these contracts that would  in all material respects  be fully offset by exchange gains on the underlying net monetary exposures for which the contracts are designated as hedges
