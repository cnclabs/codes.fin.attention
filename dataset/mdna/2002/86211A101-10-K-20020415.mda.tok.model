item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of contains certain safe harbors regarding forward looking statements 
from time to time  information provided by the company or statements made by our directors  officers or employees may contain forward looking information subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
any statements made herein that are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements including  but not limited to  statements concerning the characteristics and growth of our markets and customers  our objectives and plans for future operations and products and our expected liquidity and capital resources 
such forward looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and involve a number of risks and uncertainties  and  accordingly  actual results could differ materially 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to the continued and future acceptance of our products  the rate of growth in the industries of our products  the presence of competitors with greater technical  marketing and financial resources  our ability to promptly and effectively respond to technological change to meet evolving customer needs  risks associated with sales in foreign countries  and our ability to successfully expand our operations 
introduction this discussion summarizes the significant accounting policies  accounting estimates and other significant factors affecting the liquidity  capital resources and result of operations of the company for the three year period ended december  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
our management is also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we periodically evaluate our estimates including those relating to the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves for lower of cost or market adjustments  excess quantities and discontinued products  estimated lives and impairment of tangible and intangible long life assets  restructuring costs  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on the specific circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies impact the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of shipment 
revenue from services is recognized over the contract period or as services are provided 
revenue from license fees is recognized over the contract period or when received for fully paid license agreements 
these revenue accounting policies do not require significant estimates by management 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets that resulted from our acquisition of cyberstorage systems in which was accounted for as a purchase  are recorded at amortized cost 
we periodically review the carrying amounts of these intangible assets for indications of impairment based on the integration of the acquired technology into our product lines and market conditions for the sale of these products 
if indications of impairment are present  we assess the value of the intangible assets 
during and continuing into the first quarter of  considerable turmoil existed in storage technology markets and the impact of overall economic conditions on introduction of our new products  signaled an indication of the potential for impairment 
on the other hand  the events of september th created a strong focus on business continuance practices and information storage and redundancy 
we have analyzed the positioning of our existing and new product technologies in our market place and concluded that there was no impairment in the value of our various intangible assets 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that intangible assets associated with acquired businesses are impaired 
beginning in  the method for assessing potential impairments of intangibles will change based on new accounting rules issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
the company has not yet determined how the pronouncements will affect its future financial position and results of operations 
the new accounting rules will result in the elimination of the non cash charge to our operations for amortization of goodwill 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected non collection of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified in our portfolio of receivables 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if payments from customers are significantly delayed  additional allowances might be required 
restructuring costs during  we recorded significant restructuring accruals in connection with the integration of our acquisition of cyberstorage systems into our existing business 
these accruals included estimated costs to settle certain contractual obligations  personnel related costs for benefit programs and redundancy  and charges related to excess inventory quantities and parts for discontinued products 
the majority of our estimates were based on reasonably determinable facts and circumstances and our actual costs incurred were consistent with our estimates 
during additional reserves were provided for inventories related to discontinued products 
intellectual property rights  contingencies and litigation we have a substantial portfolio of patents  claims and other intellectual property rights 
costs and expenses in connection with the development of and the enforcement of our rights are expensed when incurred 
certain contingent fees for legal services are due upon the receipt of license fees over contract periods or upon receipt of payment for paid up license arrangements 
we currently are in legal proceedings in connection with the enforcement of our intellectual property rights the results of which cannot be predicted 
our failure to successfully enforce our patent rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in the normal course of our business  we are subject to various other proceedings  lawsuits and claims relating to product  technology  labor and other matters as further described in item legal proceedings 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses in these matters 
the amount of loss accrual  if any  is determined after careful analysis of each matter  and is subject to adjustment if warranted by new developments or revised strategies 
we believe that none of the existing matters will result in a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources our future success depends on maintaining adequate liquidity and working capital to meet our operational requirements 
given the recent volatility in the securities markets and  in particular  the securities of technology companies  we cannot assure that continuing investors investments will be available to us or that we will receive additional equity financing 
our failure to maintain adequate liquidity and working capital could have a material adverse impact on us 
we have continued to incur operating losses in while development and introduction of our new products continues and our marketing and sales activities have increased  we have implemented cost reductions programs where possible  primarily in employee headcount and the use of independent software contractors 
management believes that available working capital coupled with the ability for raising additional equity financing will support the company s operating plan 
we continue to evaluate opportunities for raising additional financing and believe that such will be available on reasonable terms to the company 
cash flows our cash flows  cash and cash equivalents  and working capital for the three years ended december  are summarized as follows change change in thousands net cash provided used in operations      net cash provided used in investing activities net cash provided used in financing activities      cash and cash equivalents      working capital     cash flow used in operations increased in due to increased operating losses and an increase in working capital accounts  excluding cash  that was partially offset by amortization of intangible assets  a provision for restructuring costs and a deferred tax provision 
cash flows used in operations continued to increase in due to increased operating losses and continued increases in working capital accounts  excluding cash  that were partially offset by the net effect of an increase in amortization of intangible assets  non cash compensation for services  a reduced provision for restructuring cost and a reduction in the provision for deferred taxes 
cash flows from investing activities have not been material 
the company does not have or anticipate any significant capital equipment requirements at this time 
cash flow from financing activities increased dramatically in we issued redeemable convertible preferred stock series a  b and c and warrants to private investors for million  warrants to purchase common stock were exercised for million and employee stock options were exercised for million 
million of the proceeds from the financings were used to pay off our bank credit facility that was then terminated 
cash flow from financing activities in consisted of a convertible preferred stock financing at a fixed conversion rate series e for million which was partially offset by the redemption of the remaining series a and b convertible preferred stock outstanding and held by outside investors for million 
the terms of the financings are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
we believe that the terms were the best available to the company at that time of each financing 
credit facilities  debt and lease payment commitments we currently have no outstanding secured debt or amounts due on credit facilities and we due not have a line of credit at the present time 
we previously had a revolving credit facility with a bank that was repaid and terminated in our annual debt maturities and lease payment under noncancellable operating leases are as follows debt maturities lease payments related party transactions in august our board of directors approved a plan to make demand loans with interest at prime plus to directors and executive officers of the company up to an aggregate of  to purchase common stock of the company in the public market and  including accrued interest was outstanding at december  the board of directors also approved a temporary advance to the chief executive officer of the company of up to  of which  including accrued interest at prime plus was outstanding at december  in january   of the advance was repaid and the balance was offset against a note payable and accrued interest due to the officer 
the company has a notes payable to the chief executive officer of the company of  with interest at prime plus and  with interest at which is convertible into common stock of the company at per share 
the notes and related accrued interest are due in april of they were offset against the temporary advance to this officer at december  in january  the balance of the temporary advance remaining unpaid of  was offset against the accrued interest and the notes payable leaving a balance due on the notes of approximately  which will be due on demand in april foreign currency transactions we do not currently utilize any derivative products to hedge its foreign currency risk 
our foreign subsidiaries obligations to their parent are denominated in united states dollars 
there is a potential for a foreign currency gain or loss based upon fluctuations between the united states dollar and our subsidiaries functional currencies  currently the german mark and the british pound and the french franc 
this exposure is limited to the period between the time of accrual of such liability to the parent in the subsidiaries functional currency and the time of its payment 
other than the intercompany balances noted above  we do not believe we have any material unhedged monetary assets  liabilities or commitments that are denominated in a currency other than the operations functional currency 
management expects such exposure to continue until its foreign subsidiaries reach a more mature level of operation 
we currently have no plans to utilize any derivative products to hedge our foreign currency risk 
recent accounting pronouncements during the fourth quarter of  the fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf application of eitf issue no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingency adjustable conversion ratios  to certain convertible instruments 
eitf no 
requires the remeasurement of the original issue discount on preferred stock with characteristics similar to the convertible preferred stock issued by the company  during fiscal year this accounting change required the value of the warrants issued with the preferred stock to be included in the calculating the beneficial conversion value 
this resulted in a cumulative charge of  to loss applicable to common stockholders in the fourth quarter of in june  the fasb finalized fasb statements no 
 business combinations sfas  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires the use of the purchase method of accounting and prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  sfas also requires that the company recognize acquired intangible assets apart from goodwill if they meet certain criteria 
sfas applies to all business combinations initiated after june  and for purchase business combinations completed on or after july  the fasb also requires  upon adoption of sfas  that the company classify the carrying amounts of intangible assets and goodwill based on the criteria in sfas sfas requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
in addition  sfas requires that the company identify reporting units for the purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill  reassess the useful lives of other existing recognized intangible assets  and ceases amortization of intangible assets with an indefinite useful life 
an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life should be tested for impairment in accordance with the guidance in sfas sfas is required to be applied in fiscal years beginning after december  to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized at that date  regardless of when those assets were initially recognized 
the company s acquisition of cyberstorage systems in was accounted for using the purchase method 
all future business combinations will be accounted for under the purchase method  which may result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  some of which may subsequently be charged to operations  either by amortization or impairment charges 
for purchase business combinations completed prior to june   the net carrying amount of goodwill was  and other intangible assets were  as of decemeber  amortization expense during the year ended december  was  the company is assessing but has not yet determined how the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
will affect its future financial position and results of operations 
the company did not acquire any goodwill or other intangible assets between the period june  and december  the company will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions for the disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas no 
became effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company reviews the carrying values of its long lived and identifiable intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 
any long lived assets held for disposal are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair values less costs to sell 
the company expects to adopt sfsas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal year and is currently reviewing the effects of adopting sfsas no 
on its financial position and results of operations 
results of operations the following table presents our consolidated statement of operations stated as a percentage of revenue for the years ended december     and revenue products and services license fees total revenues costs and expenses cost of products and services cost of license fees research and development selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring costs write down of investment total operating income loss other income loss expense income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss revenue revenues from sales of products and services decreased  in due to the continuing contraction of our customer base due to customers concerns about our financial condition  delays in delivery of upgrade features  reduced sales and marketing staff and unsuccessful attempts to reestablish our re seller sales and marketing channel 
revenues from sales of products and services increased only slightly in and consisted primarily of legacy raid products and the cyber products existing at the time that cyberstorage systems was acquired 
introduction of our new product lines of cyberborg  cybernas and cyberfibre did not begin until late in and will continue in we expect future sales to come primarily from our new product lines described elsewhere in this annual report 
revenues from license fees with respect to our patents and other intellectual properties began in with our settlement of our claims against xiotech corporation and its parent company  seagate technology  inc we currently are in legal proceedings  in connection with the enforcement of our patents and other intellectual property rights  the results of which cannot be predicted 
our failure to successfully enforce our patent rights and receive revenue from license fees could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
revenues by geographic region expressed as a percentage of total revenues is as follows year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  north america asia european sales other regions the shift in revenue from through resulted from a reduction in the european direct sales force and revenues from license fees in north america in for the years ended december  and  sales to one customer were in excess of of revenue 
all united states export sales are denominated in united states dollars to limit the amount of foreign currency risk 
export sales from the european sales offices are denominated in united states dollars 
sales occuring through our subsidiaries located in england and germany are conducted in the local functional currency 
cost of products and services cost of products and services increased  in due to additional direct and indirect manufacturing personnel associated with the cyberstorage systems acquisition in september and decreased  in due to lower level of manufacturing activity  the shift to our new product lines and staffing reductions in our factory 
included in costs of products and services were writedowns of inventory in the amount of million and million in and  respectively in connection with the restructuring 
gross profit gross profit on the sale of products and services is summarized as follows in thousands except for of sales amounts gross profit  
 restructuring costs included in the cost of products and services   gross profits were reduced in and primarily due to provisions for restructuring costs associated with excess inventory quantities and inventories related to discontinued products discussed above 
cost of license fees costs associated with to the enforcement of our patent and other intellectual property rights totaling  in were for legal and consulting fees and expenses incurred 
research and development expenses research and development expenses  relating primarily to personnel costs  expenses for independent contractors  purchase of software and supplies  were reduced by  in due to working capital reductions partially offset by increases in costs for personnel that joined the company with the cyberstorage systems acquisition 
research and development expenses to develop our new product lines increased by  in with the availability of equity financing funds 
the company expects to expend approximately  on research and development  during fiscal  relating to improvements in existing products and new product offerings  subject to the availability of working capital 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses relating to personnel staffing  expenses for public relations  trade shows  trade publications  sales commissions and travel were reduced by  in due to working capital reductions 
selling and marketing expenses increased by  in with the rebuilding of the sales and marking organization and expenses associated with the introduction on existing cyberstorage systems products and our new product lines 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses remained virtually unchanged in since the reductions in executive and administrative support personnel earlier in the year were offset by the hiring of new senior management personnel and the addition of cyberstorage systems employees 
general and administrative expenses increased by  in due primarily to continued increases in support personnel  travel expenses  legal and auditing services amortization of intangibles amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets relate to the acquisition of cyberstorage systems in september four months of amortization were recorded in and a full year of amortization was recorded in amortization of goodwill of approximately  annually will be eliminated in with the adoption of sfab described elsewhere in the annual report 
other income expense  net other income expense  net was reduced by  in due to the reduction in interest cost on our bank credit facility partially offset by decreases in other expenses primarily translation losses 
other income expense  net income increased by  in due primarily to increased interest income on invested cash and cash equivalents 
provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes increased in due primarily to the reduction of our deferred tax assets to zero by increasing the valuation reserve by  inflation inflation has not had a material impact on our operations 
acquisitions on september   we acquired cyberstorage systems corporation cyberstorage as a wholly owned subsidiary in a stock for stock acquisition and merged the two operating companies 
although on a short term basis the acquisition of cyberstorage is expected to be dilutive to our earnings  on a long term basis we expect that the cyberstorage acquisition will add to our earnings per share on a fully diluted basis 
factors that may affect future results our stock price is volatile our stock price  like that of other technology companies  is subject to significant volatility because of factors such as the announcement of new products  services or technological innovations by us or our competitors quarterly variations in our operating results changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community speculation in the press or investment community failure to meet earning expectations in addition  our stock price may be affected by general market conditions and domestic and international economic factors unrelated to the company s performance such as the dramatic decreases suffered by almost every public company in the high technology sector in further  until recently  our stock was thinly traded 
because of these factors  recent trends should not be considered reliable indicators of future stock prices or financial results 
our business may suffer if we cannot protect our intellectual property we generally rely upon patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contract rights in the united states and in other countries to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products 
however  we cannot assure you that any of our proprietary rights will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the united states 
therefore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized third party copying or use  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
further  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain licenses to any technology that it may require to conduct our business or that  if obtainable  such technology can be licensed at a reasonable cost 
intellectual property rights we are aggressively pursuing the enforcement of our intellectual property rights after an extensive patent review conducted in in  we retained a major law firm to enforce these rights against infringing parties  the number of which management believes to be extensive 
in  we began bringing legal actions against companies whose products we believed infringed on our intellectual property rights and patent portfolio 
we intend to vigorously pursue these actions 
despite ours and our legal representatives efforts  there can be no assurance or predictability as to any amount of recovery or the length of time it will take us to recover any royalties or license fees which may be recoverable 
despite our efforts to protect these intellectual property rights  unauthorized use may still occur  particularly in foreign countries 
development of new products and solutions we must make continuous investment in research and development to maintain our ongoing effort to continually improve our products and provide innovative solutions to our customers 
the development of software products is a difficult and costly process and subject to many other products requirements 
our inability to timely deliver new products in the past has had an adverse effect on our operating and financial results 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively develop new products in the future 
competition we compete with many established companies in the computer storage and server industries and certain of these companies have substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources  larger distribution capabilities  earlier access to customers and more opportunity to address customers various information technology requirements than we do 
our business may be adversely affected by the announcement or introduction of new products by our competitors  including hardware  software and services  price reductions of our competitors equipment or services and the implementation of effective marketing strategies by our competitors 
competitive pricing pressures exist in the computer storage and server markets and have had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
there also has been and may continue to be a willingness on the part of certain competitors to reduce prices in order to preserve or gain market share  which we cannot foresee 
we currently believe that pricing pressures are likely to continue 
the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines could have an adverse effect on our earnings 
rapid technological changes the computer industry is changing both dramatically and rapidly 
the development of open systems computing  the introduction of the internet  new fibre technologies san and the increasing storage density in disk drive technologies  have caused an increase in new product development and shorter time to bring the new products to market 
while we believe that our virtual storage architecture  storagesuite and cyberborg products are advanced when compared to competitive products  and complement many other products utilized in total customer solutions  we cannot assure that this will continue in the future 
the failure to remain consistently ahead of competitive technologies would have a negative impact on our operating results and financial condition 
business alliances many companies are forming business alliances with their competitors  to be able to provide totally integrated storage solutions to their customers 
one result of these alliances is to effectively preclude competitive products from being offered to customers 
many of the relationships are exclusive and our failure to develop similar relationships will effectively reduce the number of qualified sales opportunities we will have for our products in the future 
we believe that we address this issue by our return to the reseller channel sales model and having the integrator solution providers value added resellers perform the solution selling required 
our failure to open these sales channels will have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition 
operations our products operate near the limits of electronic and physical performance and are designed and manufactured with relatively small tolerances 
if flaws in design  production  assembly or testing were to occur by us or our suppliers  we could experience a rate of failure in our products that would result in substantial repair or replacement costs and potential damage to our reputation 
continued improvement in manufacturing capabilities and control of material and manufacturing quality and costs are critical factors in our future growth 
we frequently revise and update manufacturing and test processes to address engineering and component changes to our products and evaluate the reallocation of manufacturing resources among our facilities 
we cannot assure that our efforts to monitor  develop and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes for our products will be sufficient to permit us to avoid a rate of failure in our products that results in substantial delays in shipment  significant repair or replacement costs and potential damage to our reputation  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
additionally  most companies in the high technology arena are under pressure to be able to acquire and retain the services of talented individuals 
at present  there is a shortage in the number of qualified employees who are available  creating a lucrative job market for qualified and talented high tech employees 
we have had a decline in revenue in each of the three previous years and comparable reduction in our work force 
while we believe that we have the required core personnel to effectively manage and grow  we cannot assure that key employees will not leave the company in the future 
the failure to maintain key employees could adversely affect our future operating and financial results in the future 
liquidity and working capital our future success depends on maintaining adequate liquidity and working capital to meet our operational requirements 
given the recent volatility in the securities markets and  in particular  the securities of technology companies  we cannot assure you that continuing investors investments will be available to us and that we will receive additional equity financing 
our failure to maintain adequate liquidity and working capital could have a material adverse impact on us 
failure of suppliers to provide quality products we purchase several sophisticated components and products from one or a limited number of qualified suppliers 
these components and products include disk drives  high density memory components and power supplies 
we have experienced delivery delays from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality and delivery requirements 
if any of our suppliers were to fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products  we could lose time sensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased quarterly revenues and earnings  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
additionally  we periodically transition our product line to incorporate new technologies 
the importance of transitioning our customers smoothly to new technologies  along with our historically uneven pattern of quarterly sales  intensifies the risk that a supplier who fails to meet our delivery or quality requirements will have an adverse impact on our revenues and earnings 
changes in laws  regulations or other conditions that could adversely impair our condition our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if any laws  regulations or standards  both foreign and domestic  relating to us or our products were newly implemented or changed 
litigation that we may become involved in may adversely affect us in the ordinary course of business  we may become involved in litigation  administrative proceedings and governmental proceedings 
such matters can be time consuming  divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have only the market risk inherent in financial instruments that relate primarily in fluctuations in the prime rate of interest to be charged under the terms of the several promissory notes due from and to certain of our executive officers and directors because we terminated the credit facility tied to the prime rate of interest in august we do not use derivative products and do not have any material unhedged monetary assets  except for the inter company balances outstanding  which are detailed above in item foreign currency transactions
