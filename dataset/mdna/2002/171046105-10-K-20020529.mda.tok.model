the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a reporting period 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
as a result  actual results could differ because of the use of these estimates and assumptions 
the company s significant accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
the company believes the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition sales are recognized by the company at the point of purchase when the customer takes possession of the merchandise and pays for the purchase  generally with cash or credit card 
sales from purchases made with gift certificates are also recorded when the customer takes possession of the merchandise 
gift certificates issued by the company are recorded as a liability until they are redeemed 
the company has established an allowance for sales returns by customers 
this allowance has been calculated using estimates based on historical experience that management believes to be reasonable 
inventory valuation merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out retail inventory method 
permanent markdowns of inventory are recorded monthly based on an evaluation by merchandising management  which includes analyzing inventory levels  age and rate of sale 
the company further reduces the value of inventory by recording a markdown reserve based on inventory levels from the season preceding the current season as of the reporting date 
markdowns on this merchandise reflect the future anticipated selling price of the inventory 
to the extent that management s estimates differ from actual results  additional markdowns may have to be recorded  which could reduce the company s gross margins and adversely affect its financial position and results of operations 
property  equipment and improvements property  equipment and improvements are stated at cost 
property and equipment is depreciated over its estimated useful life  ranging from three to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the related leases  which is typically ten years 
repairs and maintenance  which do not extend an asset s useful life  are expensed as incurred 
when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of  the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts  and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for that period 
the company evaluates its long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company records or adjusts reserves for the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability of such assets is questionable 
income taxes income taxes are recorded following the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
realization of deferred tax assets is ultimately dependent upon future taxable income 
inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgements and interpretations of tax laws and published guidance with respect to the company s operations 
no valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets because management believes the full amount of net deferred tax assets will be realized 
the effective tax rate utilized by the company reflects management s estimation of the expected tax liabilities within various taxing jurisdictions
