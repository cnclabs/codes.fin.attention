item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in item of part ii of this form k 
our week fiscal year ends on the friday nearest to may fiscal years and contained weeks compared to weeks for fiscal year unless otherwise stated  all years and dates refer to our fiscal years and fiscal periods 
overview palm  inc is the leading global provider of handheld computing devices and operating systems for handheld devices 
for purposes of this report  we refer to the devices designed and sold by palm as palm branded devices  and we refer to devices running on the palm operating system the palm os as palm powered devices 
palm powered devices include palm branded devices as well as devices designed and sold by third parties licensing the palm os 
according to international data corporation s report sync or swim worldwide smart handheld devices forecast and analysis   palm branded devices held a leading share of the worldwide pen based handheld computing device market  and palm powered devices held approximately share of such market in calendar year we believe our focus on ease of use  usefulness and style have contributed to our leading market share position in both handheld devices and operating systems for handheld devices 
palm was founded in as palm computing inc in  it was acquired by us robotics corporation and sold its first handheld product in  quickly establishing a leadership role in the handheld device industry 
in  com corporation acquired us robotics and in  com announced the intent to separate the palm business into an independent company 
in preparation for becoming an independent  publicly traded company  palm computing  inc changed its name to palm  inc 
and was incorporated in delaware in december in march  approximately of the shares of palm s common stock was sold in an initial public offering and concurrent private placements and in july  com distributed the remaining approximately of palm s common stock outstanding to com s stockholders 
palm s total revenue has grown from approximately million in fiscal year to billion in fiscal year substantially all of our revenues to date have been generated from sales of our handheld devices and related peripherals and accessories 
to date  we have shipped over million palm branded devices and approximately million palm powered devices have been sold worldwide 
today  palm is organized into two operating segments palmsource  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of palm  inc palmsource  and the solutions group 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  we announced our strategy to separate our palm os business palmsource and our device business solutions group into two  independent companies 
we believe this independence will bring greater clarity of mission and focus to both units and better serve our existing and future licensees 
we intend to achieve external separation between the two businesses in fiscal year by making palmsource an independent public company 
in addition  in order to facilitate a distribution of palmsource stock to palm stockholders  in june  we filed a ruling request with the internal revenue service  which is still pending  seeking a determination that such a distribution  if it occurs  would be tax free 
basis of presentation through february   our consolidated financial statements were carved out from the consolidated financial statements of com  using the historical results of operations and historical bases of the assets and 
table of contents liabilities of the com business that palm comprised 
palm s legal separation from com occurred on february   at which time we began to operate independently from com 
the fiscal year consolidated financial statements include allocations to us from com corporate expenses  including centralized legal  accounting  treasury  real estate  information technology  distribution  customer services  sales  marketing  engineering and other com corporate services and infrastructure costs 
the expense allocations were determined on bases that com and we considered to be reasonable reflections of the utilization of the services provided to us or the benefit received by us 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  palm s consolidated financial statements no longer include an allocated portion of com s corporate services and infrastructure costs 
instead  payments for transitional services provided by com are included in our operating results from the fourth quarter of fiscal year and continue through fiscal year although such costs decreased over the course of the period 
final separation costs related to our separation from com were completed in the first quarter of fiscal year critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in palm s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in our balance sheets and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each of our fiscal periods are affected by estimates and assumptions which are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the product returns  deferred revenue  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty costs  goodwill and intangible asset impairments  restructuring  inventory and income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are significantly affected by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue is recognized when earned in accordance with applicable accounting standards  including aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended 
we recognize revenues from sales of handheld device products upon shipment  net of estimated returns  provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
sales to resellers are subject to agreements allowing for limited rights of return  rebates  and price protection 
accordingly  we reduce revenues for our estimates of liabilities related to these rights at the time the related sale is recorded 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns  inventory levels in the channel and other related factors 
the estimates and reserves for rebates and price protection are based on specific programs  expected usage and historical experience 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
within palmsource  revenue from software license agreements with manufacturers of handheld devices is recognized on a per unit or volume royalty basis  and any prepaid royalties received under the license agreements are deferred and recognized as earned based on contractually reported information from our licensees 
within solutions group  revenue from software license agreements with end users is recognized upon delivery of the software provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
deferred revenue is recorded for post contract support and any other future deliverables  and is recognized over the support period or as the elements of the agreement are delivered 
vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the elements contained in these software license agreements is based on the price determined by management having the relevant authority when the element is not yet sold separately 
revenue from wireless internet access service subscriptions is recognized over the service period 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and an assessment of international  political and economic risk as well as the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of recoverability of amounts due us could be adversely affected 

table of contents we accrue for warranty costs based on historical rates of repair as a percentage to shipment levels and the expected repair cost per unit  warranty policies and specific known warranty issues 
if we experience warranty claims or significant changes in costs of warranty services for example third party vendor repair charges  materials or freight  which could be higher or lower than our historical experience  our gross margin could be affected 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on at least an annual basis in accordance with the guidance in statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may strategically realign our resources which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
we accrue for restructuring costs when we make a commitment to a firm exit plan that specifically identifies all significant actions to be taken in conjunction with our response to a change in our strategic plan  product demand  increased costs or other environmental factors 
we reassess the prior restructuring accruals on a quarterly basis to reflect changes in the costs of the restructuring activities  and we record new restructuring accruals as commitments are made 
estimates are based on anticipated costs to exit such activities and are subject to change 
inventory purchases and purchase commitments are based upon forecasts of future demand 
we value our inventory at the lower of standard cost which approximates first in  first out cost or market 
if we believe that demand no longer allows us to sell our inventory above cost or at all  then we write down that inventory to market or write off excess inventory levels 
if customer demand subsequently differs from our forecasts  requirements for inventory write offs could differ from our estimates 
our deferred tax assets represent temporary differences that will result in deductible amounts in future years  including net operating loss carryforwards 
based on estimates and certain tax planning strategies  the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to increase our valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense 
our key accounting estimates and policies are reviewed with the audit committee

table of contents and marketing programs  salaries and benefits for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel expenses and related information technology and facilities costs 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues were in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily reflects decreased revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily the result of decreased television and media advertising  lower product promotion and in store advertising and decreased personnel and related expenses all intended to better align our spending with lower revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year personnel and related expenses decreased primarily due to reduced headcount of approximately in fiscal year compared to fiscal year research and development research and development expenses were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year  a decrease of million or

the decrease was primarily the result of the implementation of sfas no 
at the beginning of fiscal year  resulting in goodwill no longer being amortized and the impairment of the intangible assets related to the acquisition of anyday 
com  inc anyday recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which resulted in these assets not being amortized during fiscal year this was partially offset by amortization charges resulting from certain acquisitions made during fiscal year we completed our transitional and annual impairment tests of the goodwill recorded on our balance sheet during fiscal year  and there was no impairment indicated 
there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings

we cannot be certain  however  that our underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses will be accurate 
if our operating results were to fail to meet our expectations or if inventory  accounts receivable or other assets were to require a greater use of cash than is currently anticipated  we could be required to seek additional funding through public or private financings or other arrangements 
in such event  adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms  which could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations

business environment and risk factors company specific trends and risks risks related to our business if we fail to develop and introduce new products and services timely and successfully  we will not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer 
we operate in a highly competitive  quickly changing environment  and our future success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services that our customers and end users choose to buy 
if we are unsuccessful at developing and introducing new products and services that are appealing to our customers and end users with acceptable prices and terms  our business and operating results would be negatively impacted because we would not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues would suffer 
we expect to release a new version of our palm os operating system  a new arm based handheld device and new enterprise server software for our i wireless device between early summer and the fall of calendar year if we are not able to introduce these or other new products on a cost effective and timely basis  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
the development of new products and services can be very difficult and requires high levels of innovation 
the development process is also lengthy and costly 
if we fail to anticipate our customers and end users needs and technological trends accurately or are otherwise unable to complete the development of products and services in a cost effective and timely fashion  we will be unable to introduce new products and services into the market to successfully compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products  we could have costly excess production or inventories or we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost effective production of our handheld devices 
the demand for our products depends on many factors and is difficult to forecast  in part due to competition  variations in economic conditions  seasonality  changes in consumer and enterprise preferences and relatively short product life cycles 
it is particularly difficult to forecast demand by individual product 
significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could result in costly excess production or inventories or the inability to secure sufficient quantities or cost effective production of our handheld devices 
this could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
for instance  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we experienced a sudden and unanticipated decline in demand of our products 
as a result  we incurred a charge to cost of revenues of million in fiscal year related to excess inventory and related costs  which included million for non cancelable component commitments 
in fiscal year  we recognized a million benefit to cost of revenues as a result of higher than anticipated sales of older products and recoveries on components that were previously written off in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 
table of contents our operating results are subject to fluctuations  and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our share price may decrease significantly 
our operating results are difficult to predict 
our future operating results may fluctuate significantly and may not meet our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our stock would likely decline 
factors that may cause fluctuations in our operating results include  and are not limited to the following consumer and enterprise spending levels may fail to meet our expectations 
changes in general economic conditions and specific market conditions may impact the demand for our products and services 
changes in consumer and enterprise preferences for our products and services may impact the demand for our products and services 
price and product competition from other handheld devices or other devices with similar functionality may adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
seasonality of demand for our products and services may cause our revenues to fluctuate on a quarter over quarter basis 
variations in product costs or the mix of products sold may affect our profit margins in any particular quarter 
quality issues with our products may result in the rejection of our products and damage to our reputation  as well as lost revenues  diverted development resources and increased service costs and warranty claims 
changes in pricing or promotional programs may fail to meet our expectations 
manufacturing lead times may affect our third party manufacturers ability to produce quality products on time which may harm our reputation and cause our results of operations to suffer 
if our ability to achieve targeted product cost reductions and operating expense reductions fails  our operating results could be affected 
the introduction and market acceptance of new products and services may affect our operating results if customer demand fails to meet our expectations 
excess inventory or insufficient inventory to meet demand may adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
unpredictability of our licensee s product introductions or market acceptance may cause our results of operations to suffer 
any of the foregoing factors  or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
we rely on third party manufacturers and distributors to design  manufacture and distribute our handheld devices  and our reputation and results of operations could be adversely affected if these third party manufacturers fail to meet their performance obligations 
we outsource some of our hardware design to third party manufacturers 
we depend on their design expertise and we rely on them to design our products at satisfactory quality levels 
if our third party manufacturers fail to provide quality hardware design  our reputation and results of operations could suffer 
we outsource all of our manufacturing to third party manufacturers 
we depend on them to produce sufficient volume of our products in a timely fashion and at satisfactory quality levels 
in addition  we rely on our 
table of contents third party manufacturers to place orders with suppliers for the components they need to manufacture our products 
if our third party manufacturers fail to produce quality products on time and in sufficient quantities  our reputation and results of operations could suffer 
if they fail to place timely and sufficient orders with suppliers  our results of operations could suffer 
most of our device products are manufactured by our third party manufacturers at their international facilities 
the cost  quality and availability of third party manufacturing operations are essential to the successful production and sale of our handheld devices 
our reliance on third party manufacturers exposes us to risks which are not in our control and our operating results could be negatively impacted 
we do not have a manufacturing agreement with one of the primary third party manufacturers upon which we rely to manufacture our device products 
we presently order our products on a purchase order basis from this manufacturer 
the absence of a manufacturing agreement means that  with little or no notice  this manufacturer could refuse to continue to manufacture all or some of the units of our devices that we require or change the terms under which it manufactures our device products 
if this manufacturer were to stop manufacturing our devices  we may be unable to replace the lost manufacturing capacity on a timely basis and our results of operations could be harmed 
in addition  if this manufacturer were to change the terms under which they manufacture for us  our manufacturing costs could increase and our profitability could suffer 
our contract distribution facilities are physically separated from our contract manufacturing locations 
this requires additional lead time to move products to customers 
if we are shipping products near the end of the quarter  this extra time could result in us not meeting anticipated shipment volumes for that quarter  which may negatively impact our results of operations 
changes in air transportation schedules or security measures in response to terrorist threats or attacks or military activity could cause transportation delays and increases in our costs for both receipt of inventory and shipment of products to our customers 
if these types of disruptions occur  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
we depend on our suppliers  some of which are the sole source for certain components and elements of our technology  and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand on a cost effective basis and alternative sources are not available 
our device products contain components  including liquid crystal displays  touch panels  memory chips and microprocessors  that are procured from a variety of suppliers 
the cost  quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our device products 
some components  such as displays and certain integrated circuits  digital signal processors  microprocessors  radio frequency and discrete components come from sole source suppliers 
alternative sources are not always available or may be financially prohibitive 
if suppliers were unable or unwilling to meet our demand for sole source components and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price for an alternative source is prohibitive  our ability to maintain timely and cost effective production of our handheld computing device products would be seriously harmed 
we enter into agreements for the development and licensing of third party technology to be incorporated into some of our products 
our ability to release and sell our products could be seriously harmed if the third party technology is not delivered to us in a timely manner or contains errors or defects which are not discovered and fixed prior to release of our products and we are unable to obtain alternative technology to use in our products 
our inability to obtain alternative technology could result in damage to our reputation as well as lost revenues and diverted development resources 

table of contents we will continue to rely on our handheld device products as the primary source of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
our revenues and our results of operations depend substantially on the commercial success of our palm handheld devices 
if revenues from our palm handheld devices fail to meet expectations  our other revenue sources will likely not be able to compensate for this shortfall and our results of operations may suffer 
in fiscal year  revenues from sales of devices and accessories constituted approximately of our consolidated revenues 
we rely on distributors  retailers and resellers to sell our products  and disruptions to these channels would adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our handheld devices 
our distributors  retailers and resellers sell products offered by our competitors 
if our competitors offer our distributors  retailers and resellers more favorable terms or have more products available to meet their needs  those distributors  retailers and resellers may de emphasize or decline to carry our products or carry our competitors products instead 
if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with distributors  retailers and resellers or to expand our distribution channels  our business will suffer 
because we sell our products primarily to distributors  retailers and resellers  we are subject to many risks  including risks related to product returns  either through the exercise of contractual return rights or as a result of our strategic interest in assisting them in balancing inventories 
in addition  our distributors  retailers or resellers could modify their business practices  such as payment terms or inventory levels 
unexpected changes in return requests  inventory levels  payment terms or other practices by our channel customers could negatively impact our results of operations or our financial condition 
distributors  retailers and traditional resellers experience competition from internet based resellers that distribute directly to end user customers  and there is also competition among internet based resellers 
we also sell our products directly to end user customers from our palm 
com web site 
these varied sales channels could cause conflict among our channels of distribution  which could harm our revenues and results of operations 
if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced margins and loss of market share  and our results of operations and financial condition would suffer 
we compete in the handheld device  operating system software and wireless services markets 
the markets for these products and services are highly competitive  and we expect competition to increase in the future 
some of our competitors or potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than palm to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements 
they may also devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products 
some competitors sell or license server  desktop and or laptop computing products in addition to handheld computing products and may choose to market and sell or license their handheld products at a discounted price or give them away for free with their other products  which could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 
certain competitors may have longer and closer relationships with the senior management of enterprise customers who decide which products and technologies will be deployed in their enterprises 
moreover  these competitors may have larger and more established sales forces calling upon potential enterprise customers and therefore could contact a greater number of potential customers with more frequency 
consequently  these competitors could have a better competitive position than we do  which could result in potential enterprise 
table of contents customers deciding not to choose our products and services  which would adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our handheld computing device products compete with a variety of smart handheld devices  including keyboard based devices  sub notebook computers  smart phones and two way pagers 
our principal handheld device competitors include casio  hewlett packard  nokia  research in motion limited rim  sharp and palmsource licensees such as acer  handera formerly trg  handspring  kyocera  samsung and sony  who compete either directly or indirectly with our handheld computing devices 
in addition  companies such as matsushita  nec and toshiba as well as several smaller companies in asia and europe offer or intend to sell handheld devices 
the separation of our solutions group and palmsource businesses into two independent companies may result in more competition for our solutions group handheld devices as palmsource may license the palm os to device companies who compete directly or indirectly with the solutions group business 
if revenues of our solutions group business suffer because of competition from third party licensees of our palm os platform  our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
our wireless services compete with a variety of alternative technologies and services  such as those based on different industry standards for wireless access  information appliances that provide wireless connectivity and other traditional and developing methods 
competitors to our wireless services include earthlink  go america  rim and potentially other device manufacturers who offer wireless services 
our wireless access business also competes indirectly with other providers of wireless access  ranging from dedicated internet service providers  such as aol time warner  to local phone companies and telecommunications carriers 
our palm os platform competes primarily with operating systems such as microsoft s windows ce for sub pc computers  microsoft s pocket pc  stinger and pocket pc phone edition  symbian s os for wireless devices  java based platforms such as those found on cell phones  proprietary operating systems from companies such as sharp electronics and operating systems based on linux 
licensees of our palm os platform are under no obligation to introduce new products based on our operating system and may elect not to use the palm os platform and instead use an alternative operating system  in which case we may not be able to increase our revenues from licensing the palm os platform or expand the proliferation of the palm economy 
in addition  handheld computers depend upon good interoperability with software running on personal computers and network servers in order to acquire and back up information 
if microsoft or other companies interfered with that interoperability for palm os devices  the salability of palm os could be adversely affected 
successful new product introductions or enhancements by our competitors  or increased market acceptance of competing products  such as the pocket pc and rim devices or devices offered by our licensees  such as handspring and sony  could reduce the sales and market acceptance of our products and services  cause intense price competition or could make our products obsolete 
to be competitive  we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development  sales and marketing and customer support 
we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to make these investments or that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to be competitive 
increased competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced margins and loss of market share 
our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our palm os platform and handheld devices may contain errors or defects  which could result in the rejection of our products and damage to our reputation  as well as lost revenues  diverted development resources and increased service costs and warranty claims 
our palm os platform and our devices are complex and must meet stringent user requirements 
we must develop our software and hardware products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing handheld device market 
products and services as sophisticated as ours are likely to contain undetected errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released 
our products may not be free from 
table of contents errors or defects after commercial shipments have begun  which could result in the rejection of our products  damage to our reputation  lost revenues  diverted development resources and increased customer service and support costs and warranty claims which could harm our business  results of operation and financial condition 
we may have to cancel or delay the release of certain features in our palm os platform and product shipments if we are unable to obtain key technology from third parties  or we might incur increased costs to obtain or develop the technology from another third party or ourselves 
we license third party software for use in the palm os platform as well as to provide software development tools to enable applications to be written for our palm os platform 
in addition to third party licensed software  we also enter into joint development agreements with certain licensees of the palm os platform whereby a licensee will develop a specific feature for our palm os platform which we will then own and may later incorporate into new releases of the palm os platform 
we expect that we will continue to license third party software and to enter into joint development arrangements 
if a third party developer or a joint developer fails to develop software in a timely fashion or at all  we may not be able to deliver certain features in our products as expected  or we could be required to expend unexpected development costs to develop the software ourselves or use cash to obtain it from another third party 
as a result  our product introductions could be delayed or our offering of features could be reduced  which could affect our operating results 
furthermore  the third party developer or joint developer may improperly use or disclose the software  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
in addition  because we license some of our development tools from third parties  our business would suffer if we could no longer obtain those tools from those third parties or if the tools developers wanted to use were not available 
we have internally separated our business into two independent businesses by transferring our palm os platform and licensing business to our palmsource subsidiary 
if we fail to manage our separate businesses effectively  our on going business prospects and overall financial performance may suffer 
in december  we separated our business into two independent businesses and formed our palmsource subsidiary to contain our palm os platform and licensing business 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to effectively implement and manage these two independent businesses or that each of the businesses can successfully run its own independent operations 
failure to effectively manage two independent business operations or failure of the two businesses to sustain efficient operations or to successfully implement their business strategies could cause deterioration in our revenues  compromise our on going business prospects and impair our overall financial performance 
if we do not externally separate our palmsource and solutions group businesses  our business and results of operations could suffer 
while we have organized our operations into the palmsource and solutions group businesses  we have also indicated an external separation objective of outside private or public investment in palmsource in calendar year  by making palmsource an independent public company 
our future plans also contemplate a possible distribution of palmsource stock to palm stockholders 
if we fail to achieve the objective of outside investment in palmsource and or we do not distribute palmsource stock to palm stockholders  our business may be adversely affected 
we may lose current licensees and or attract fewer new licensees to the palm os platform due to concern about lack of independence from the products of the palm solutions group 
this could result in the palm os platform being less competitive 
in addition  we may face challenges managing our two independent businesses in a single company group without compromising business opportunities for one business because of potentially conflicting business priorities with the other business 
we may also have difficulty attracting and retaining key employees without an external separation 

table of contents palmsource currently derives its revenue from a small number of licensees of the palm os platform  and the failure of one or more of them to build a successful sustained business selling products from which palmsource derives revenue could significantly harm palmsource s results of operations or future business prospects 
palmsource currently derives its revenue from a small number of licensees of the palm os platform 
if one or more of them fails to build a successful sustained business selling products from which palmsource derives revenue  palmsource could lose a significant portion of its revenue 
in addition  the failure of a palm os platform licensee to continue developing  marketing and selling products based on the palm os platform could make the palm os platform appear to be less attractive and deter prospective palmsource customers from licensing the palm os platform  thereby reducing the actual or perceived market opportunity available to licensees and palmsource 
furthermore  the failure or loss of one or more current licensees or the inability to attract new licensees could make palmsource less attractive to potential investors  which could limit our ability to externally separate the palmsource business  result in the palm os platform being less competitive and cause our business and results of operations to suffer 
if we do not deliver or expand the wireless access and services that the market desires or we fail to provide our devices or services on additional carrier networks  including networks in international markets  our results from operations could suffer 
we must continue to adapt our wireless services strategy to compete in the rapidly evolving wireless services market 
the future success of our wireless services business substantially depends on the geographic coverage  capacity  affordability  reliability and security of wireless networks 
we currently offer a subscription based wireless access service that enables users of our palm vii and i handheld devices to access internet content  communicate via electronic mail  and in the case of the i handheld  communicate using instant messaging 
we currently rely on a sole carrier for our palm handheld wireless services and our products are configured around the frequency standard used by them 
if this carrier failed to provide us with service at rates acceptable to us or at all  we may not be able to provide wireless access to our users which could cause our business and results of operations to suffer 
our wireless services strategy depends on our ability to develop new wireless access devices that operate on additional wireless networks 
many wireless carriers  including international carriers  use different standards and transmit data on frequencies different than those used by our palm vii and i today 
we are in the process of designing new products that will be compatible with alternative networks 
our products may be subject to a lengthy certification process with each wireless carrier with whom we seek to enter into a relationship as well as with governmental or regulatory authorities 
these certification requirements could delay the offering of additional wireless products and services 
if we are unsuccessful at developing new devices that operate on other wireless networks or if we are unsuccessful at building favorable relationships with additional us and international carriers  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
competitors have introduced or developed  or are in the process of introducing or developing  competing wireless services accessible through a variety of handheld devices and other information appliances 
we cannot assure you that there will be demand for the wireless services provided by us or that individuals will widely adopt our handheld devices as a means of accessing wireless services 
if acceptance of our wireless services and solutions is less than anticipated  our results from operations could be adversely affected 
our success largely depends on our ability to hire  retain  integrate and motivate sufficient qualified personnel 
our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled executive  technical  sales  marketing  supply chain and administrative personnel 
it also depends on our ability to expand  integrate and retain our management team 
in spite of the economic slowdown  recruiting and retaining skilled personnel  
table of contents including software and hardware engineers  is highly competitive  particularly in the san francisco bay area where we are headquartered 
volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to retain key employees  all of whom have been granted stock options 
in recent quarters  we have initiated reductions in our workforce of both employees and contractors to balance the size of our employee base with our anticipated revenue base 
these reductions have resulted in reallocations of employee duties  which could result in employee and contractor uncertainty 
reductions in our workforce could make it difficult to motivate and retain the remaining employees and contractors  which would affect our ability to deliver our products in a timely fashion and negatively affect our business 
third parties have claimed and may claim in the future that we are infringing their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses  or be prevented from selling products if these claims are successful 
in the course of our business  we frequently receive claims of infringement or otherwise become aware of potentially relevant patents or other intellectual property rights held by other parties 
we evaluate the validity and applicability of these intellectual property rights  and determine in each case whether we must negotiate licenses or cross licenses to incorporate or use the proprietary technologies in our products 
third parties may claim that we or our customers or palm os platform licensees are infringing or contributing to the infringement of their intellectual property rights  and we may be found to infringe or contribute to the infringement of those intellectual property rights and require a license to use those rights 
we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology  products and services 
any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements or indemnify our customers or palm os platform licensees 
however  we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale or our products

if third parties infringe our intellectual property  we may expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
if we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
our pending patent and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of these patent applications or trademark registrations 
in addition  our patents may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to detect infringement and may lose competitive position in the market before we do so 
in addition  competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies 
intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries  which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share 
in the past  there have been thefts of computer equipment from us and our employees 
this computer equipment has contained proprietary information and intellectual property

the complaint seeks to have us pay restitution or disgorgement of the purchase price of the units and or damages and attorneys fees 
we filed an answer denying the allegations and the parties are in the early stages of discovery 
no trial date has been set 
our future results could be harmed by economic  political  regulatory and other risks associated with international sales and operations 
since we sell our products worldwide  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
we anticipate that revenues from international operations will represent an increasing portion of our total revenues over time 
in addition  several of the facilities where our devices are manufactured and 
table of contents distributed are located outside the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in emerging markets  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws  difficulty in managing widespread sales operations  difficulty in managing a geographically dispersed workforce in compliance with diverse local laws and customs  and less effective protection of intellectual property 
we are subject to changes in demand for our products resulting from exchange rate fluctuations that make our products relatively more or less expensive in international markets 
if exchange rate fluctuations occur  our business could be harmed by decreases in demand for our products or reductions in gross margins 
we may pursue strategic acquisitions and investments which could have an adverse impact on our business if unsuccessful 
within the last two and a half years  we have acquired thinairapps  inc  certain assets of be incorporated  peanutpress 
com  inc  wesync 
com  inc  anyday 
com  inc  and actual software corporation 
we will evaluate other acquisition opportunities that could provide us with additional product or service offerings or additional industry expertise as they arise 
acquisitions could result in difficulties assimilating acquired operations and products  and result in the diversion of capital and management s attention away from other business issues and opportunities 
integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and management teams 
we may not successfully integrate operations  personnel or products that we have acquired or may acquire in the future 
if we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions  our business could be materially harmed 
in addition  our acquisitions may not be successful in achieving our desired strategic objectives  which would also cause our business to suffer 
these transactions may result in the diversion of capital and management s attention away from other business issues and opportunities 
in addition  we have made strategic venture investments in other companies which provide products and services which are complementary to ours 
if these investments are unsuccessful  this could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 
our strategy to broaden usage of our devices in the enterprise includes strategic alliances with established partners 
if we are not able to successfully enter into new enterprise strategic alliances with partners  or the relationships we do establish are not rewarding  our enterprise market penetration may not proceed as rapidly or as lucratively as we anticipate  which could impact our results 
we believe strategic and leveraged alliances with enterprise partners are important to our success in enterprise adoption of our products 
these relationships will provide leverage for us and provide additional resources to further enable penetration of the enterprise market 
if we are unable to successfully enter into strategic and leveraged alliances  or if they are not as productive as we anticipate  our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
our flexibility to operate our business may be constrained by the requirements of our credit facility 
in june  we obtained a two year asset backed  borrowing base credit facility from a group of financial institutions for up to a maximum of million with the actual amount available determined by eligible 
table of contents accounts receivable and inventory as well as a real estate line of credit less the amount of outstanding letters of credit 
the terms of our credit facility requires us to maintain a minimum cash balance as of the last day of each month  obtain the prior consent of our lenders before we engage in certain specified actions such as incurring certain indebtedness  making certain investments or distributions  making certain acquisitions  making certain capital expenditures or causing a change in control of palm 
if we are unable to obtain our lenders consent  we will be unable to take certain actions and our business may suffer 
failure to meet certain covenants or the occurrence of certain events result in an event of default which confers additional rights on our lenders and could cause us to suffer adverse financial and business consequences 
as of may   we have used our credit facility to support the issuance of letters of credit of million 
business interruptions could adversely affect our business 
our operations and those of our suppliers and customers are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure  terrorist attacks  wars and other events beyond our control 
in addition  the business interruption insurance we carry may not be sufficient to compensate us fully for losses or damages that may occur as a result of such events 
any such losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the third party service provider eds upon which we rely for our it data center and other network services contracts with worldcom for the infrastructure and support of our wide area network services 
worldcom is facing significant business and financial challenges  and its ability to continue operations may be in jeopardy 
if our wide area network services failed  or if we or eds were required to switch from worldcom to another wide area network service provider  our operations could be disrupted and our business could suffer 
risks related to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock our common stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations and volatility 
our common stock has been publicly traded since march  the market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations since the date of our initial public offering 
these fluctuations could continue 
among the factors that could affect our stock price are quarterly variations in our operating results  changes in revenues or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts  speculation in the press or investment community  strategic actions by us or our competitors  such as new product announcements  acquisitions or restructuring  actions by institutional stockholders  general market conditions  and domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance 
in addition  the stock markets in general  and the markets for high technology stocks in particular  have experienced high volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law and our adoption of a stockholder rights plan may delay or prevent acquisition of us  which could decrease the value of your shares 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions include a classified board of directors and limitations on actions by our stockholders by written consent 
delaware law also imposes 
table of contents some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer 
although we believe these provisions provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan  pursuant to which we declared and paid a dividend of one right for each share of common stock held by stockholders of record as of november  unless redeemed by us prior to the time the rights are exercised  upon the occurrence of certain events  the rights will entitle the holders to receive upon exercise thereof shares of our preferred stock  or shares of an acquiring entity  having a value equal to twice the then current exercise price of the right 
the issuance of the rights could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of debt securities with maturities of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to maintain the safety of principal and preserve liquidity while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in marketable investment grade securities and by limited exposure to any one issue or issuer 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at may  and june   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
it is our current intention to hold our investments until maturity  and therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates 
if necessary  we may sell our cash equivalent and or short term investments prior to maturity to meet the liquidity needs of the company 
foreign currency exchange risk in the third quarter of fiscal year  we began denominating our sales to certain european customers in the euro and in pounds sterling 
we also incur expenses in currencies other than functional currency of our reporting entities 
we are hedging certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign currency exchange rates by using foreign exchange contracts 
we did not hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes during fiscal years  and and we do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes in the future
