item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significant factors in performance for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced the company s performance during the past three fiscal years  this financial discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements presented in this form k 
critical accounting policies management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
product revenues are recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss and satisfaction of significant vendor obligations  if any 
service revenues are recognized based on contracted hourly rates  as services are rendered  or upon completion of specified contracted services 
net sales consist of product and service revenues  less discounts and estimated allowances for sales returns 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s estimate of its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods 
first  the company evaluates specific accounts over days outstanding and applies various levels of risk analysis to these accounts to determine a satisfactory risk category to which given percentages are applied to establish a reserve 
second  a general reserve is established for all other accounts over days outstanding  exclusive of the accounts identified for the specific reserve  in which a percentage is applied that is supportable by historic collection patterns 
product returns 
in general  the company follows a strict policy of duplicating the terms of its vendor or manufacturers product return policies 
however  in certain cases the company must deviate from this policy in order to satisfy the requirements of certain sales contracts and or to satisfy or maintain customer relations 
to establish a reserve for returns  outstanding return merchandise authorizations rma are reviewed 
those rmas issued for which the related product has not been returned by the customer are considered future sale reversals and are fully reserved 
in addition  an estimate  based on historical return patterns  is provided for probable future rmas that relate to past sales 
vendor returns 
after product has been returned to vendors under authenticated rmas  the company reviews such outstanding receivables from its vendors and establishes a reserve on product that will not qualify for refund based on a review of specific vendor receivables 
rebates 
rebates result principally from satisfying various manufacturer sales quotas under certain incentive programs 
rebate programs are subject to audit by the manufacturer as to whether the sales requirements were actually fulfilled 
the company establishes reserves to cover any losses resulting from subsequent audits and the return of funds  based on historical patterns of audit results 
inventory 
although the company employs a virtual inventory model that generally limits its exposure to inventory losses  with certain large customers the company contractually obligates itself to product availability terms that require maintaining physical inventory  as well as configured product 
such inventory is generally confined to a very limited range of product that applies to specific customers or contracts 
included in the company s inventory is product that has been returned by customers but is not acceptable as returnable by the vendor 
as a result  the company exposes itself to losses from such inventory that requires reserves for losses to be established 
the company records reserves on all returned product and inventory that is over six months old 
overview the company initially began its operations in march of as a reseller of information technology products 
in fiscal  the company began offering value added services to its customers 
gradually value added services represented a larger percentage of total net sales  accounting for and of the company s net sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
the gross profit margins on the value added services that the company currently offers are significantly higher than the gross profit margins on the company s information technology product business  but require additional overhead expense for supervision  idle time  and other expenses related to service offerings that in part offset a portion of the increased margin 
in the company s initial operating years  net sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of increasing from million in fiscal to million in fiscal seasonal trends were not prominent in the company s business  although the march quarter was historically regarded as one of the least promising quarters 
the past growth in net sales was principally driven by a robust economy and information technology market that accommodated the company s business model and allowed it to expand geographically through the opening of sales offices 
however  in fiscal the company experienced its first annual decline of million in sales due to a softer information technology market and difficulties in transitioning to a new erp business system 
fiscal years and have continued the negative trend with declines of and million  respectively  in net sales 
since the december quarter of  quarterly net sales consistently declined for twelve consecutive quarters when compared to prior fiscal year quarters 
the quarterly rate of decline for the four quarters of the current fiscal year  while still negative  appears to be lessening to some degree with the percentage decline narrowing to a single digit in the september quarter as compared with increasing larger percentage declines of   and  for the earlier sequential quarters 
in fiscal years and in response to declining sales  the company conducted two restructurings of its sales and administrative force 
some leased sales offices were converted into virtual offices in which employees work from home based offices with additional technical and administrative support supplied by corporate headquarters to assist field personnel in customer support 
operating expenses  exclusive of non recurring charges  were million  a continued reduction from prior year core operating expenses of million 
non recurring charges declined million  which combined with the million decline in other operating expenses lessened the impact of the million gross profits decline and resulting in an operating loss of million 
because the company s business model involves the resale of information technology products held in inventory by certain distributors  the company does not maintain significant amounts of inventory on hand for resale 
the company typically does not place an order for product purchases from distributors until it has received a customer purchase order 
inventory is then drop shipped by the distributor to either the customer or shipped to the company s configuration center in ontario  california 
the distributor typically ships products within hours following receipt of a purchase order and  consequently  substantially all of the company s net sales in any quarter result from orders received in that quarter 
although the company maintains a relatively small amount of inventory in stock for resale  it records as inventory the merchandise being configured and products purchased from distributors and shipped  but not yet received and accepted by customers 
product revenues are generally recognized upon shipment 
service revenues are recognized based on contractual hourly rates as services are rendered or upon completion of specified contract services 
net sales consist of product and service revenues  less discounts 
cost of sales includes product and service costs and current and estimated allowances for returns of products that are not accepted by the company s distributors or manufacturers  less any incentive credits 
in june of  firstsource corp 
firstsource  formerly firstsource 
com and purchase pointe  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary  began operations as an internet based business to business provider of products and services 
from a series of private placements of equity capital  the company s voting interest in may dropped below 
with the company not otherwise having effective control over firstsource  the company began accounting for its investment in its former subsidiary under the equity method of accounting 
on april   firstsource ceased operations entirely and all of its assets were assigned to sherwood partners  inc unaffiliated with the company  as an assignee for the benefit of creditors 
in november  the company formed a new subsidiary  supplyaccess  inc supplyaccess 
supplyaccess was designed as an internet portal charging transaction fees to the seller 
the company transferred its information technology department and related computer equipment and software to supplyaccess in exchange for a million note receivable 
no gain or loss was recognized on the transaction 
concurrently it was agreed that supplyaccess would provide the company with information technology services and would allow company customers access to its fulfillment engine for the initial year for a flat quarterly fee of in a series of private placements of equity capital that began in february that were undertaken to raise additional capital  the company s voting interest was eventually reduced to 
with the company s interest dropping below and not otherwise having control over its former subsidiary  the company began in april of accounting for its supplyaccess investment under the equity method of accounting 
on september   the company in settlement of a dispute with supplyaccess  agreed to pay supplyaccess million for the assignment and transfer of the en pointe sap application software and certain other listed assets 
in so doing  effective october   the company cancelled the balance of the note receivable from supplyaccess of  and agreed to assume the information technology responsibilities previously assigned to supplyaccess 
in january  a majority of the shareholders of supplyaccess approved the transfer of the assets of supplyaccess to a liquidator for the benefit of creditors 
at the time of this transfer  en pointe owned approximately of the voting securities of supplyaccess 
in connection with the liquidation of supplyaccess in february  the company acquired full rights to accesspointe tm as well as the intellectual rights to all of supplyaccess software  copyrights  trade secrets and other proprietary rights 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended september  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses non recurring income charges operating loss interest expense  net other income  net gain on sale of assets minority interest loss before income taxes and income losses from affiliates benefit provision for income taxes income losses from affiliates net loss income comparison of fiscal years ended september  and net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decline represents a continuation of weak capital spending by business that has been noted in the quarterly reports 
while the decline in net sales has been persistent over the past eight quarters  the most severe decline of in quarter over prior year quarter net sales occurred in the last quarter of fiscal year following closely on the heels of that decline  the first quarter of fiscal year registered a negative 
since the first quarter of fiscal  quarter declines have moderated 
for the march  june  and september quarters of fiscal the percentage declines were   and respectively 
product net sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the million decrease is exclusive of million of miscellaneous excess credits previously granted to customers that were taken to income as a part of an ongoing process to improve customer transaction processing 
service revenues also declined million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal for the year ended september   two of the company s major customers accounted for million or of net sales revenues  as follows with amounts stated in millions fiscal year net sales fiscal year net sales customer customer gross profit 
the decline in net sales directly impacted gross profits  reducing gross profits by million or to million in fiscal from million for gross profits expressed as a percentage of net sales also slid fractionally by a tenth of a percent to in from in the million decline in gross profits can be traced to lower margins on product sales 
product gross profits decreased million or to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
expressed as a percentage of net sales  the product gross profit percentage declined from in the prior fiscal year to 
the decline in product gross profit is attributable to more aggressive pricing policies employed for capturing market share  including large sales of microsoft software licenses at relatively low margins  as well as a lessening in rebate income that is dependent on volume sales and manufacturer vender availability 
service gross profits also fell as a result of the decline in service revenues  registering a total decline of million or to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
however  service gross profits expressed as a percentage of service revenues increased to from the in the prior fiscal year 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses decreased million or to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal most of the million decrease  million  relates to the reduction of commissions  salaries and wage related benefits 
since sales commissions are computed based on gross margin dollars under the company s method of commission payment  declines in gross profits  as was experienced in the fiscal year  will directly reduce commission expense 
because declining sales volume provides less of a base for spreading certain fixed selling and marketing expenses  selling and marketing expenses when expressed as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased a very slight million or to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal a reduction in facilities related expense  including rent reduction from renegotiation of the headquarters lease contributed to the reduction in general and administrative expense 
as with selling and marketing expenses  when general and administrative expenses are expressed as a percentage of net sales  such expenses show an increase of from to in fiscal  which can be attributable again to the decline in net sales volume 
non recurring income charges 
non recurring income of million in fiscal primarily resulted from the settlement of a litigation claim  million 
in the settled litigation claim  the company was liable for a total of million under various court decisions including accrued interest and settled for million 
in addition  there was a recovery of million of insurance reimbursement relating to previously expensed legal fees offset by other legal costs of million 
operating loss 
operating loss increased million  or  to a loss of million in fiscal from a million operating loss in fiscal although total operating expenses decreased million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal  the decrease was insufficient to compensate for the million decline in gross profits 
because of declining sales volume  providing less base for spreading expenses  operating loss when expressed as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in interest expense 
interest expense is net of interest income of million 
interest expense incurred under the foothill financing agreement consisted principally of charges for acting as guarantor to ibmcc in order for ibmcc to provide a day interest free flooring to the company 
in addition to the guarantee charge  foothill charged from to per annum for float and per annum for any unused credit line 
total interest and related charges paid to foothill amounted to million million less than the prior fiscal year 
most of the interest expense  million in both fiscal years and  incurred by the company represents interest expense related to the ontario facility lease that is being treated as a financing lease and is presently carried as a long term liability 
income losses from affiliates 
as a result of the deconsolidation of two previously consolidated subsidiaries see note to the consolidated financial statements  in the june quarter of the company began using the equity method of accounting to record its interest in the losses related to the two affiliates 
because the company had guaranteed certain debt of its affiliates and was responsible under certain other obligations  losses in excess of the company s investment in its affiliates were recorded 
such losses were in large part reversed in fiscal and taken to income as the guarantees and obligations were removed or discharged 
total income from reversal of losses for the year amounted to million  which includes million of profit on past sales to affiliates  million of estimated costs in transitioning information technology services the related costs for which were previously incurred and reported in operations in the first quarter of the current fiscal year  and million for lease guarantees for one of its former affiliates 
the much larger prior fiscal year income from the reversal of losses of million included a reversal of million of lender guarantees provided by the company to one of its affiliates along with the reduction of information technology reserves for the resumption of information technology responsibilities and the reversal of a note reserve related to an affiliate 
benefit provision for income taxes 
the company files a consolidated federal income tax return  while for many of its state tax returns it files separately under the name of its wholly owned sales subsidiary en pointe technologies sales  inc that is qualified to do business in all fifty states 
with the march  passage of the job creation and worker assistance act of tax law  the company recognized an unanticipated net million federal income tax benefit in the second quarter of fiscal year the tax bill allowed the company to carry back net operating losses nols arising from the current fiscal year as well as from the prior fiscal year to recover taxes from the two fiscal years ended september  and that were previously closed to such carry backs 
the total tax benefits recognized by the company under the new tax law were million for the year  of which million was from prior year nol 
offsetting  in part  the million of federal tax benefits for nols  was million of tax expense  most of which related to a prior year amended federal income tax return 
in carrying tax losses back to prior years the company has exhausted all of its benefits from recovery of taxes paid in prior years so that any future losses will have to be carried forward to apply to future income years 
as of september  the company had million of such nols that may be carried forward of which million nol will be considered an adjustment to additional paid in capital and will not benefit future earnings  since that portion of the nol was attributable to the exercise of stock options by employees which had not been recognized as expense for financial statement purposes 
net loss income 
a net loss of million was realized for the current fiscal year as compared to net income of million in the prior fiscal year 
the net effect of the change from net income to net loss amounted to million 
a decrease in gross profits of million  offset  in part  by a reduction in operating expenses of million resulted in an operating loss change to million 
however  the million operating loss change was further adversely impacted by million  consisting of million less benefits from the reversal of losses from affiliates reduced by the million of tax benefits from the tax law change 
as a percentage of net sales  the net loss was  as compared with a net income of in fiscal comparison of fiscal years ended september  and net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal approximately a quarter of the million decrease results from the fiscal deconsolidation of former subsidiaries that contributed million of the million in prior year net sales 
the remaining million decrease in sales  or was attributable to softness in the marketplace and an erosion of customer base 
services revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and were of total net sales versus in the prior year 
net sales under the ibm contract accounted for of total net sales and of total accounts receivable for the fiscal year compared with and  respectively  for the prior fiscal year 
in absolute dollars ibm net sales decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting the same conditions noted above 
fiscal quarterly net sales compared to the respective prior fiscal year quarters have shown a consistent negative trend throughout the fiscal year 
percentage declines commencing with the first quarter of the fiscal year were    and  respectively 
sequentially net sales declined in every quarter of fiscal except for the june quarter  which registered a modest increase 
gross profit 
as a result of the decline in net sales  gross profits decreased million  or to million in fiscal from million for however  gross profits expressed as a percentage of net sales actually increased by one full percentage point to in from in the increase in gross margin percentage is attributable to some lessening of pricing pressures in the industry on information technology products as well as increased margins from the rising service revenues 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses decreased million or to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal of the million decrease  million of selling and marketing expenses was attributable to former subsidiaries that were reported on a consolidated basis during the first nine months of prior fiscal year but which were subsequently deconsolidated 
another million of the decrease was wage related  in part due to restructuring  including million from lower wage cost and million from a decrease in sales commissions paid as a result of the decline in net sales volume 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expenses decreased one full percentage point to in from in most of the one percent decrease represents former subsidiaries expenses that were included in the financial results for the first nine months of the prior fiscal year before deconsolidation 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million or to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal most of the decrease  million  is due to the deconsolidation of former subsidiaries  as noted above 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses declined from to in fiscal  all of which was attributable to the deconsolidation 
non recurring charges 
non recurring charges of million consist of million for restructuring charges  a million charge relating to settlement of a law suit  and income of million related to a legal suit in which plaintiff attorney fees and costs previously awarded by the court were reversed 
restructuring charges occurred in the june quarter when the workforce was reduced by and nine rental locations were identified for closure or reduced in size 
sales personnel working in the location of the closures were converted to a virtual sales environment under a carefully monitored program of the company see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that its restructuring will result in lower selling and marketing costs in future quarters 
non recurring charges declined million  or to million from the million reported in fiscal  when a million restructuring charge and million charge related for plaintiff attorney fees and costs that were awarded by the court and subsequently on appeal reversed in were recognized 
operating loss 
operating loss decreased million  or  to a loss of million in fiscal from a million operating loss in fiscal although total operating expenses decreased million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal  the decrease was insufficient to compensate for the million decline in gross profits 
most of the decrease  million  can be accounted for by the deconsolidation of former subsidiaries  as noted above 
operating loss  as a percent of net sales  decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal included in interest expense are portions of the lease payments related to the ontario configuration center that is treated as a financing lease 
such lease payments amounted to million in fiscal and fiscal the decrease in interest expense was due mainly to the decline in borrowing under the credit lines  due to declining sales volumes 
while interest charged under the company s lines of credit increased in april from 
under prime to over prime  or  the prime rate declined during the fiscal year to compensate in large part for the increase in rates 
as a result  the company s weighted average borrowing rate increased only slightly to from in the prior year 
gain on sale of assets 
gain on sale of assets decreased million to from million in the prior fiscal year 
the prior year million gain was attributed to the sale of marketable securities that were acquired in connection with the private placement of a former subsidiary 
income losses from affiliates 
as a result of the deconsolidation of two previously consolidated subsidiaries see note to the consolidated financial statements  in the june quarter of the company began using the equity method of accounting to record its interest in the losses related to the two affiliates 
because the company had guaranteed certain debt of its affiliates and was responsible under certain other obligations  losses in excess of the company s investment in its affiliates were recorded 
such losses were in large part reversed in fiscal and taken to income as the guarantees and obligations were removed or discharged 
provision for income taxes 
because the loss reversal income from affiliates of million is not subject to tax  and tax adjustments for other differences between book and tax are inconsequential  the company estimates a million tax nol for the fiscal year 
since there are no longer any open prior years with taxable income to which the nol may be carried back  no benefit has been recognized for the current year tax loss 
the current provision for income taxes relates to certain minimum state income and franchise taxes 
net income loss 
net income was million as compared to a net loss of million in the prior fiscal year 
the improvement in earnings is due to the million loss reversal income from affiliates and the million decrease in operating expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  net income was  as compared with a net loss of in fiscal liquidity and capital resources during fiscal operating activities provided cash totaling million compared with million in the prior fiscal year 
the major factor for the million reduction in cash provided from operations was from a greater million reduction in accounts receivable experienced in fiscal  than was achieved in fiscal  attributable  in large part  to the sharp decline in fiscal fourth quarter net sales from those of the prior fiscal year s quarter 
the company s accounts receivable balance  net of allowances for returns and doubtful accounts  at september  and  was million and million  respectively 
the number of days sales outstanding in accounts receivable increased to days from days  as of september  and  respectively 
however  when computing the number of days sales outstanding in accounts receivable on fourth quarter fiscal net sales  such number decreased to days  compared to days in the prior fiscal year 
investing activities used cash totaling million for fiscal which is relatively unchanged from the million in the prior fiscal year 
the cash used from investing activities in fiscal was for the acquisition of property and equipment 
financing activities provided net cash totaling million in fiscal  while using cash of million in fiscal the cash provided in fiscal was chiefly from net borrowings of million under the company s lines of credit while the primary use of cash from financing activities in fiscal was to pay down million on the company s lines of credit that resulted from the million reduction in accounts receivable 
as of september   the company had approximately million in cash and working capital of million 
the company has a three year million revolving credit facility with foothill capital corporation foothill that expires on december  the credit facility is collateralized by accounts receivable and all other assets of the company 
in addition  ibm credit corporation ibmcc continued to provide the company with a day interest free inventory flooring financing for up to million under a separate one year agreement expiring on december  as of september   most of the company s borrowings under its credit lines were concentrated in the million borrowings outstanding under its ibmcc day interest free flooring agreement 
the company had additional borrowing capacity of approximately million after taking into consideration the available collateral and borrowing limitations under its financing agreements 
borrowings under both lending agreements are collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets 
in addition  the lines of credit contains certain financing and operating covenants relating to net worth  liquidity  profitability  repurchase of indebtedness and prohibition on payment of dividends  as well as restrictions on the use of proceeds obtained under the line 
at september  the company was in compliance with all of the loan covenants 
borrowing availability on the foothill credit facility is directly reduced by any outstanding flooring financings 
the financing agreement with foothill includes a guarantee to ibmcc for the amount outstanding on the flooring line up to a maximum of million 
in consideration for providing the guarantee  the foothill agreement contains a annual charge provision on the average outstanding balances owing to ibmcc 
the foothill agreement initially provided for a maximum interest rate of one and a half percent over the prime rate with any reduction in interest rates being dependent upon the company meeting certain earnings targets 
under a july  amendment to the foothill agreement discussed below  the maximum rate for interest  which is based on certain targets related to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  was increased by to prime rate plus or the libor rate plus 
in its june fiscal quarter  the company estimated that it was possible that if the loss trends noted in and through such quarter continued  that the company would be unable to meet its june quarter ebitda covenants under its existing lines of credit with foothill and ibmcc  respectively  and would be in default under the terms of such agreements 
to avert such a default  the company renegotiated its lines of credit to ease the ebitda covenant requirements and signed an amendment to the loan agreement with foothill on july  and then subsequently with ibmcc on august  under the new covenants for both loan agreements  the ebitda for the nine months ended june  could not exceed a negative million 
thereafter  ebitda is measured on a cumulative rolling four quarter basis ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter  with the september  quarter being set at a negative million  the december  quarter a negative million  the march  quarter a negative million  the june  quarter a positive million  the september  quarter a positive million  and all fiscal quarters thereafter remaining at the same positive million 
two other financial covenants that were previously in place  tangible net worth of million and an annual limitation on maximum asset acquisitions of million  remained the same 
on november  ibmcc extended their million interest free flooring financing agreement through december  under terms of the amendment  ibmcc added a provision that limits on hand inventory flooring amounts to million  which the company believes is adequate for its anticipated on hand inventory needs 
as reflected in the financial statements contained in part iv  item  the company has experienced declining sales and losses from operations in each of the last three fiscal years ended september  sales declines of approximately million and operating losses of approximately million in fiscal were attributable to the activities of former subsidiaries which have since been deconsolidated see note investment in affiliates 
management believes that  with the exception of the amounts related to the deconsolidated former subsidiaries  the remainder of the company s sales declines and losses are primarily attributable to an industry wide decline in information technology spending 
in order to counter the sales and profitability declines  the company completed two restructurings in fiscal years and in which certain fixed occupancy and payroll costs were reduced 
in addition  in the second quarter of fiscal  there was a change in certain key executives 
as part of that change  the chairman and ceo returned to his former position as president of the company with responsibility for day to day operations 
in addition  the company rehired its former senior vice president of sales and certain senior sales employees who had previously worked at the company 
the new management team has taken the following actions intended to increase sales and improve profitability a refocused the company s sales strategy back to an aggressive personal face to face selling model by hiring new account executives an increase of approximately from the number of account executives employed prior to the change in management and implementing more robust processes for managing account executives performance against sales quotas  b reasserted the company s focus on selling managed services which have higher gross margins than product sales  c qualified the company as a minority owned business in order to provide it with enhanced sales opportunities for certain public and private sector customers whose procurement policies provide preferences to minority owned businesses  d committed the company to a strategy of acquiring targeted smaller competitors where the company believes that the acquisition will be immediately accretive to earnings and the company has the opportunity to complete the acquisition at an affordable price 
as discussed in note  on october   the company acquired tabin corporation  a chicago based value added reseller 
as discussed above  the company has a million line of credit agreement with foothill capital corporation foothill  which expires in december the company also has a million inventory flooring agreement with ibm credit corporation ibmcc  which expires on december  borrowings under the inventory flooring agreement serve to reduce the availability of financing available under the line of credit agreement 
management believes that the financing available to the company under these credit agreements  together with its own working capital resources at september   the company had net working capital of approximately million will provide the company with sufficient working capital to finance its operations through at least the next fiscal year 
also as discussed above  both the foothill and ibmcc agreements contain certain restrictive covenants requiring  among other things  the maintenance of specified levels of tangible net worth and the attainment of specified amounts of profitability 
management believes that the operating plans it has implemented will enable it to maintain compliance with its covenants through at least september  however  there can be no assurance that management s plans will be successful in improving the company s sales and profitability 
if the company is unable to maintain compliance with its loan covenants and if such noncompliance is not waived by the lenders  the working capital line of credit and flooring line could be revoked prior to their expiration dates 
in such eventuality  management believes that it has sufficient working capital to enable it to continue to operate through at least september  however  the company would be required to significantly scale down its business plans if it were unable to obtain alternative sources of financing

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company presently has very limited exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates from borrowings under its lines of credit 
the company s primary working capital financing agreement is with foothill 
while foothill s lending agreement provides for interest at a maximum rate of over prime  ibmcc  in a separate lending agreement  provides day free flooring  with the stipulation that foothill guarantees any company borrowings 
for the guarantee to ibmcc  foothill charges the company a on outstanding balances 
through judicious use of its ibmcc interest free flooring  the company has been able to largely limit its interest charges to on borrowings in fiscal year because of the company s ability to have available interest free flooring  assuming interest rates increase by an assumed percentage in the next fiscal year  there would be no financial impact upon the company for the incremental increase  so long as the company is successful in limiting its borrowing to its million day interest free flooring 
borrowings in excess of million would  of course  be subject to foothill s borrowing rate of over prime with the prime rate at as of september  and subsequently lowered to effective november  
the company is also committed to off balance sheet obligations represented by operating leases for office facilities and various types of office equipment which are fully disclosed in the financial statement footnotes 
the company has no commercial paper  derivatives  swaps  hedges  joint ventures and or partnerships  or currency fluctuation to disclose and evaluate for market risks
