the company will record the value of the shares of the common stock issued to the ceo of approximately  as debt cost and amortize over the terms of the related agreements 
the auditor s opinion related to the consolidated financial statements included in this report states that there is substantial doubt as to the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
delivery of this opinion would have triggered an event of default under the loan agreement and the note purchase agreement as originally executed because both agreements require audited financial statements to be delivered within days of december  with an auditor s opinion that does not contain such going concern language 
however  the default provisions relating to the audit opinion in the loan agreement and the note purchase agreement have been waived 
as of april   the company has complied with all of the requirements of the loan agreement and believes that it has the financial resources available to meet its working capital needs through fiscal year as a result of the recapitalization  the bofa credit facility  the forbearance agreement with bank of america  and all subsequent amendments were terminated 
however  because those agreements were significant to the capitalization of the company in  the terms of those agreements are briefly summarized as follows on march   the company entered into a forbearance agreement and a first amendment to forbearance agreement wherein bank of america agreed to forbear from exercising its rights and remedies under the bofa credit facility due to certain defaults 
the company was in default at that time for violating certain restrictive covenants and for failing to make principal payments when due 
all of the defaults were foreborne as provided for in the forbearance agreement  and revised restrictive covenants were set 
by september   the company was in default under the forbearance agreement for failing to comply with some of the revised covenants  including minimum net worth  debt service coverage  leverage and minimum ebitda 
on october   the company entered into the second amendment to the forbearance agreement 
the second amendment amended the forbearance agreement as follows i changed the termination date of the forbearance agreement from march  to january  the period from march  through january  being defined as the forbearance period  ii required the company to maintain a general operating account with bank of america and restricted the use of funds in an calendar month to payments equal to or less than a monthly budget submitted to bank of america  iii required the company to pay any accrued or unpaid interest but not principal on the b of a note on the first day of each month and allow interest to continue to accrue at the bank of america prime rate plus two and one half percent per annum  and iv required the company to furnish bank of america with certain financial reports 
the second amendment also amended the termination events as defined in the forbearance agreement to include the following i the company fails to execute and deliver or to cause the company s ceo  marshall b 
hunt and hunt lllp to execute and deliver within days from the effective date of the second amendment a pledge to bank of america of all the stock owned by hunt and documentation to amend the current pledge agreement between hunt  hunt lllp and the company 
the pledge documents will be held in escrow and will be released only in the event that hunt interferes with the daily operations of the company determinable at the bank of america s discretion at any point prior to january   ii the company fails to engage and hire within five days from the effective date of the second amendment competent crisis and turn around management and a new chief executive officer who shall report directly to the independent members of the company s board of directors  iii the company fails to provide bank of america within five days from the effective date of the second amendment a copy of resolutions confirming hunt s resignation as an officer and director of the company and that no further salary or bonuses shall be paid to hunt  iv the company fails to make efforts to refinance the amounts outstanding under the bofa credit facility and fails to provide weekly status reports  v on or before december   the company fails to provide bank of america evidence that the company has engaged an investment banking firm to begin marketing the sale of the assets of the company if the amounts outstanding under the bofa credit facility are not paid off by the termination date  or vi the company fails to execute and deliver to bank of america within hours of bank of america s request a consent order consenting to the appointment of a receiver in the event of a termination event 
in addition  the second amendment reduced the working capital sublimit to  and limited the working capital loan to the smaller of the working capital sublimit or an amount equal to the borrowing base  as defined in the bofa credit facility 
the second amendment also amended several of the financial covenants previously contained in the forbearance agreement 
the forbearance agreement provided for the payment of excess cash flow  as defined in the bofa credit facility  on the ninetieth day following the last day of each fiscal year 
there was no excess cash flow payment required for fiscal year in addition  the forbearance agreement required an additional principal payment in the amount of the greater of  or the gross proceeds payable to the company in connection with the company s sale of the ifm product line see note to the company s consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this form k 
the forbearance agreement further required payments of  each on the bofa bridge loan on may   august   and november  all of the installments under the bofa bridge loan were paid 
the forbearance agreement also provided for a forbearance and restructuring fee of  plus related expenses and interest at the rate then in effect plus upon a termination event  as defined in the forbearance agreement 
in connection with the forbearance agreement  the company issued a warrant to bank of america to acquire  shares of the company s common stock for 
per share 
the warrant was exercisable by bank of america during a three year period without regard to the status of the bofa credit facility or the bofa bridge loan 
the company recorded the estimated fair value of the warrant as of december  of  determined using the black scholes model using weighted average assumptions as follows dividend yield of  expected life of five years  expected volatility of and a risk free interest rate of as a deferred cost and amortized the deferred cost over the forbearance period 
as with the bofa credit facility and other related agreements  the warrant was cancelled pursuant to the recapitalization 
the forbearance agreement also required the company to hire on or before june  a new chief operating officer  restricted the repayment of principal debt to junior lien holders  and to either i sell the assets of ifm or ii obtain an agreement from the seller of the ifm product line to defer all payments under the related promissory note see below through the termination date see note to the company s consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this form k regarding the sale of the ifm product line 
the company hired a chief operating officer in april who was terminated in june  and the company did not hire a replacement 
the company sold the assets of the ifm product line as of march  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this form k 
on december   the company entered into a third amendment to the forbearance agreement under which bank of america consented to the increase in payments of  per month to certain former shareholders of stepic 
in january  the company entered into a fourth amendment to forbearance agreement with bank of america  pursuant to which bank of america agreed to extend the forbearance period until march  the expiration date in order for the company to consider its strategic alternatives 
on march   the bofa credit facility was assigned from bofa to comvest 
on march   the company issued the convertible notes in an aggregate amount of million to comvest  medtronic and the additional note purchasers 
on march   the company entered into the lasalle credit facility 
impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange fluctuations the results of the company s operations for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuations 
while the company has not historically been adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials and components  several gpo agreements to which the company is a party limit the company s ability to raise prices 
thus  future increases in the cost of raw materials and components could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
this could change in situations in which the company is producing against a substantial backlog and may not be able to pass on higher costs to customers 
in addition  interest on substantially all of the company s debt is variable and therefore may increase with inflation 
the company makes all sales to foreign customers in us dollars 
thus  notwithstanding fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates  the company s profit margin for any purchase order is not subject to change due to exchange rate fluctuations after the time the order is placed 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
supercedes accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  and for all business combinations accounted for by the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is after june   establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill  and requires unallocated negative goodwill to be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and amortized 
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
supersedes apb no 
 and requires that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized  goodwill will be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level  intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life will be tested for impairment at least annually  and the amortization period of intangible assets with finite lives will no longer be limited to forty years 
as of december   the company has goodwill and other intangible assets of million and has recognized amortization expense of approximately million during the year ended december  upon the adoption of sfas no 
 the company recognized an impairment loss of approximately million related to its manufacturing reporting unit 
in addition  the company ceased amortization of its goodwill see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for the company s expected future amortization charges after adoption of sfas no 

in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations aro  which has an effective date for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  this statement addresses the diversity in practice for recognizing asset retirement obligations and requires that obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset be recorded as a liability when those obligations are incurred  with the amount of the liability initially measured at fair value 
upon initially recognizing a liability for an aro  an entity must capitalize the cost by recognizing an increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
the impact of sfas no 
is not expected to be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which has an effective date for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  this statement  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  as well as certain other accounting standards  establishes a single accounting model  based on framework established in sfas no 
for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  including segments of a business accounted for as discontinued operations 
the impact of adopting sfas no 
is not expected to be material to the company s financial statements 
risk factors future capital requirements there can be no assurance that the company s cash flow from operations and cash available from external financing will be sufficient to meet the company s future cash flow needs  in which case the company would need to obtain additional financing 
as of march   the company had million of borrowing capacity under the lasalle credit facility 
there are certain covenants in the loan agreement  the compliance with which is not objectively determinable and  as a result  the auditor s opinion accompanying the consolidated financial statements included in this report states that there is substantial doubt as to the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
see item description of business recent developments for a description of the recapitalization 
any additional financing could involve issuances of debt or issuances of equity securities which would be dilutive to the company s stockholders  and any debt facilities could contain covenants that may affect the company s operations  including its ability to make future acquisitions 
adequate additional funds  whether from the financial markets or from other sources  may not be available on a timely basis  on terms acceptable to the company or at all 
insufficient funds may cause the company difficulty in financing its accounts receivables and inventory and may result in delay or abandonment of some or all of the company s product acquisition  licensing  marketing or research and development programs or opportunities  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company is required to make periodic interest and principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness  including the convertible notes  the lasalle credit facility and the junior note 
failure to make any such required payments may result in an event of default and the acceleration of all outstanding indebtedness 
for a description of the company s scheduled payments on its obligations  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
limited manufacturing experience the company s success will depend in part on its ability to manufacture its products in compliance with international and domestic standards such as iso  the fda s good manufacturing practices gmp regulations and other applicable licensing and regulatory requirements in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis  while maintaining product quality and acceptable manufacturing costs 
the company has historically outsourced the manufacturing of most of its product lines to third parties while remaining responsible for that work 
in the fourth quarter of  the company transitioned the manufacturing of its circle c r and pheres flow r specialty catheter product lines into its manufacturing facility in manchester  georgia 
during  the company transitioned the manufacturing of its lifeport tm  infuse a port r and infuse a cath r product lines to the manchester facility from a facility in norwood  massachusetts 
during  the company transitioned the manufacturing of the vortex tm  titanport tm and omegaport r product lines to the manchester facility from norfolk medical 
in  the company transitioned the manufacturing of the triumph r port line to the manufacturing facility from act medical as well as its infusion sets which had previously been manufactured by a third party 
the company has undergone and expects to continue to undergo regular gmp inspections in connection with the manufacture of its products at the company s facilities 
the company s success will depend  among other things  on its ability to efficiently manufacture different products and to integrate newly developed products with existing products 
the company s failure to successfully commence the manufacturing of new products  to maintain or increase production volumes of new or existing products in a timely or cost effective manner or to maintain compliance with iso  the ce mark requirements  gmp regulations or other applicable licensing or regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
management of growth  risks associated with acquisitions the rapid growth experienced by the company to date has placed  and could continue to place  significant demands on the company s management  operational and financial resources 
from time to time  the company may pursue additional strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies as a means of expanding its existing product lines and distribution channels 
as the medical devices industry continues to consolidate  the company expects to face increasing competition from other companies for available acquisition opportunities 
there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition candidates will be available  that financing for such acquisitions will be obtainable on terms acceptable to the company or that such acquisitions will be successfully completed 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including i the potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize anticipated synergies  economies of scale or other value  ii diversion of management s attention  iii responsibility for undiscovered or contingent liabilities and iv loss of key employees of acquired operations 
the relocation of manufacturing operations for acquired product lines to the company s manufacturing facility in manchester  georgia also may result in interruptions in production and back orders 
no assurance can be given that the company will not incur problems in integrating any future acquisition and there can be no assurance that any future acquisition will increase the company s profitability 
further  the company s operating results in fiscal quarters immediately following a material acquisition may be materially adversely affected while the company integrates the acquired business into its existing operations 
any such problems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and operating results 
in addition  future acquisitions by the company may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  large one time charges and the creation of goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant amortization expense 
manufacturing relationships while the company believes it has a good relationship with each third party that manufactures the company s products  there can be no assurance that such relationships will not deteriorate in the future 
deterioration in these manufacturing relationships could cause the company to experience interruptions in its manufacturing and delivery processes and have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
furthermore  when the manufacturing arrangements with these third parties expire  the company will have to make other manufacturing arrangements or manufacture products at company facilities 
the failure to effectively plan for the expiration of these agreements could also result in interruption of the manufacturing and delivery processes for these products and have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
dependence on patents  trademarks  licenses and proprietary rights the company believes that its competitive position and success has depended  in part  on and will continue to depend on the ability of the company and its licensors to obtain patent protection for its products  to defend patents once obtained  to preserve its trade secrets and to operate without infringing upon patents and proprietary rights held by third parties  both in the united states and in foreign countries 
the company s policy is to protect its proprietary position by  among other methods  filing united states and foreign patent applications relating to technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of its business 
the company owns numerous united states and foreign patents and united states and foreign patent applications 
the company also is a party to license agreements with third parties pursuant to which it has obtained  for varying terms  the right to make  use and or sell products that are covered under such license agreements in consideration for royalty payments 
many of the company s catheter products are subject to such license agreements 
there can be no assurance that the company or its licensors have or will develop or obtain additional rights to products or processes that are patentable  that patents will issue from any of the pending patent applications filed by the company or that claims allowed will be sufficient to protect any technology that is licensed to the company 
in addition  no assurances can be given that any patents issued or licensed to the company or other licensing arrangements will not be challenged  invalidated  infringed or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages for the company s business or products 
in such event the business  financial condition  and operating results of the company could be materially adversely affected 
a number of medical device companies  physicians and others have filed patent applications or received patents to technologies that are similar to technologies owned or licensed by the company 
there can be no assurance that the company is aware of all patents or patent applications that may materially affect the company s ability to make  use or sell its products 
united states patent applications are confidential while pending in the united states patent and trademark office pto  and patent applications filed in foreign countries are often first published six or more months after filing 
any conflicts resulting from third party patent applications and patents could significantly reduce the coverage of the patents owned or licensed by the company and limit the ability of the company or its licensors to obtain meaningful patent protection 
if patents are issued to other companies that contain competitive or conflicting claims  the company may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology 
there can be no assurance that the company would not be delayed or prevented from pursuing the development or commercialization of its products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical devices industry 
although the company has not been a party to any material litigation to enforce any intellectual property rights held by the company  or a party to any material litigation seeking to enforce any rights alleged to be held by others  future litigation may be necessary to protect patents  trade secrets  copyrights or know how owned by the company or to defend the company against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of the company and others 
the validity and breadth of claims covered in medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are unresolved 
any such litigation could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by the company 
adverse determinations in any such litigation could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  could require the company to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent the company from manufacturing  selling or using certain of its products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company also relies on trade secrets and proprietary technology that it seeks to protect  in part  through confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach  that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to the company s trade secrets 
the company also relies upon trademarks and trade names for the development and protection of brand loyalty and associated goodwill in connection with its products 
the company s policy is to protect its trademarks  trade names and associated goodwill by  among other methods  filing united states and foreign trademark applications relating to its products and business 
the company owns numerous united states and foreign trademark registrations and applications 
the company also relies upon trademarks and trade names for which it does not have pending trademark applications or existing registrations  but in which the company has substantial trademark rights 
the company s registered and unregistered trademark rights relate to the majority of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that any registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names of the company will not be challenged  canceled  infringed  circumvented  or be declared generic or infringing of other third party marks or provide any competitive advantage to the company 
potential product liability because its products are intended to be used in healthcare settings on patients who are physiologically unstable and may be seriously or critically ill  the company s business exposes it to potential product liability risks which are inherent in the medical devices industry 
in addition  many of the medical devices manufactured and sold by the company are designed to be implanted in the human body for extended periods of time 
component failures  manufacturing flaws  design defects or inadequate disclosure of product related risks with respect to these or other products manufactured or sold by the company could result in injury to  or death of  a patient 
the occurrence of such a problem could result in product liability claims and or a recall of  safety alert relating to  or other fda or private civil action affecting one or more of the company s products or responsible officials 
the company maintains product liability insurance coverage in amounts that it deems sufficient for its business 
there can be no assurance  however  that such coverage will be available with respect to or sufficient to satisfy all claims made against the company or that the company will be able to obtain insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts 
product liability claims or product recalls in the future  regardless of their ultimate outcome  could result in costly litigation and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in september  the company initiated a voluntary product recall of its dialysis and central venous catheter kit product lines due to small pinholes in the product packaging 
although the recall covers products manufactured since  product returns through december  were approximately  units 
no product complaints have been received to date for either pinholes in the packaging or infection of the implant site that could be attributed to the packaging being contaminated 
in  the recall was terminated by the fda 
new product introductions although the vascular access product industry has not experienced rapid technological change historically  as the company s existing products become more mature  the importance of developing or acquiring  manufacturing and introducing new products that address the needs of its customers will increase 
the development or acquisition of any such products will entail considerable time and expense  including acquisition costs  research and development costs  and the time and expense required to obtain necessary regulatory approvals  which approvals are not assured  and any of which could adversely affect the business  results of operations or financial condition of the company 
there can be no assurance that such development activities will yield products that can be commercialized profitably or that any product acquisition can be consummated on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
to date  substantially all of the company s products have been developed in conjunction with third parties or acquired as a result of acquisitions consummated by the company 
the inability of the company to develop or acquire new products to supplement the company s existing product lines could have an adverse impact on the company s ability to fully implement its business strategy and further develop its operation 
customer concentration the company s net sales to its three largest customers accounted for  and of total sales during  and  respectively 
the loss of  or significant curtailments of purchases by  any of the company s significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on key suppliers the company purchases raw materials and components for use in manufacturing its products from many different suppliers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its existing supplier relationships or secure additional suppliers as needed 
in addition  stepic has generated of its sales through distribution of products of three major manufacturers 
see item business description of business by industry segment product distribution 
the loss of a major supplier  the deterioration of the company s relationship with a major supplier  changes by a major supplier in the specifications of the components used in the company s products  or the failure of the company to establish good relationships with major new suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  and financial condition and operating results 
see discussion of distribution relationship with pall biomedical in item description of business by industry segment product distribution 
dependence on key personnel the company s success is substantially dependent on the performance  contributions and expertise of its executive officers and key employees 
the company s success to date has been significantly dependent on the contributions of marshall b 
hunt  its chairman and chief executive officer  and william e 
peterson  jr  its president  each of whom is party to an employment agreement with the company and on each of whom the company maintains key man life insurance in the amount of million 
mr 
hunt s employment agreement expires march   and mr 
peterson s employment agreement expires september  the company is wholly dependent on certain key employees to manage its distribution business 
the company is also dependent on its ability to attract  retain and motivate additional personnel 
the loss of the services of any of its executive officers or other key employees or the company s inability to attract  retain or motivate the necessary personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
control by certain shareholders as of the date of this report  hunt  peterson  and roy c 
mallady  jr 
collectively own more than of the company s outstanding common stock 
in addition  comvest  medtronic and the additional note purchasers have the right to convert a portion of their convertible notes into up to million shares of common stock 
comvest and its affiliates also received  shares of common stock in connection with the recapitalization

healthcare reform pricing pressure the healthcare industry in the united states continues to experience change 
in recent years  several healthcare reform proposals have been formulated by members of congress 
in addition  state legislatures periodically consider healthcare reform proposals 
federal  state and local government representatives will  in all likelihood  continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methodologies  and ongoing public debate of these issues can be expected 
cost containment initiatives  market pressures and proposed changes in applicable laws and regulations may have a dramatic effect on pricing or potential demand for medical devices  the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by both government and third party payors to persons providing medical services 
in particular  the healthcare industry is experiencing market driven reforms from forces within the industry that are exerting pressure on healthcare companies to reduce healthcare costs 
managed care and other healthcare provider organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of the population in the united states that receives medical benefits through such organizations and in terms of the influence and control that they are able to exert over an increasingly large portion of the healthcare industry 
managed care organizations are continuing to consolidate and grow  increasing the ability of these organizations to influence the practices and pricing involved in the purchase of medical devices  including certain of the products sold by the company  which is expected to exert downward pressure on product margins 
both short and long term cost containment pressures  as well as the possibility of continued regulatory reform  may have an adverse impact on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
government regulation the company s products and operations are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities  including  but not limited to  the fda and state and foreign governmental authorities 
in particular  the company must obtain specific clearance or approval from the fda before it can market new products or certain modified products in the united states 
the fda administers the fdc act 
under the fdc act  most medical devices must receive fda clearance through the section k notification process k or the more lengthy premarket approval pma process before they can be sold in the united states 
to obtain k marketing clearance  a company must show that a new product is substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness to a product already legally marketed and which does not require a pma 
therefore  it is not always necessary to prove the actual safety and effectiveness of the new product in order to obtain k clearance for such product 
to obtain a pma  a company must submit extensive data  including clinical trial data  to prove the safety  effectiveness and clinical utility of its products 
the process of obtaining such clearances or approvals can be time consuming and expensive  and there can be no assurance that all clearances or approvals sought by the company will be granted or that fda review will not involve delays adversely affecting the marketing and sale of the company s products 
fda s quality system regulations also require companies to adhere to certain good manufacturing practices requirements  which include testing  quality control  storage  and documentation procedures 
compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is monitored through periodic site inspections by the fda 
in addition  the company is required to comply with fda requirements for labeling and promotion of its products 
the federal trade commission also regulates most device advertising 
in addition  international regulatory bodies often establish varying regulations governing product testing and licensing standards  manufacturing compliance eg  compliance with iso standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  import restrictions  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements and pricing and reimbursement levels 
the inability or failure of the company to comply with the varying regulations or the imposition of new regulations could restrict the company s ability to sell its products internationally and thereby adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
failure to comply with applicable federal  state or foreign laws or regulations could subject the company to enforcement actions  including  but not limited to  product seizures  injunctions  recalls  possible withdrawal of product clearances  civil penalties and criminal prosecutions against the company or its responsible officials  any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
federal  state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of medical devices are subject to future changes  as are administrative interpretations of regulatory requirements 
no assurance can be given that such changes will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
from time to time  the company has received section fd and warning letters from the fda regarding the company s compliance with fda regulations 
the company has worked with the fda to resolve these issues 
there can be no assurance the company will not receive additional fd s or warning letters in the future or that it will be able to reach an acceptable resolution of the issues raised in such letters 
limitations on third party reimbursement in the united states  the company s products are purchased primarily by hospitals and medical clinics  which then bill various third party payors  such as medicare  medicaid and other government programs and private insurance plans  for the healthcare services provided to patients 
government agencies  private insurers and other payors determine whether to provide coverage for a particular procedure and reimburse hospitals for medical treatment at a fixed rate based on the diagnosis related group drg established by the united states centers for medicare and medicaid services cms 
the fixed rate of reimbursement is based on the procedure performed and is unrelated to the specific devices used in that procedure 
if a procedure is not covered by a drg  payors may deny reimbursement 
in addition  third party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that the device used in a treatment was unnecessary  inappropriate or not cost effective  experimental or used for a non approved indication 
reimbursement of procedures implanting the company s vascular access ports and catheter products is currently covered under a drg 
there can be no assurance that reimbursement for such implantation will continue to be available  or that future reimbursement policies of third party payors will not adversely affect the company s ability to sell its products on a profitable basis 
failure by hospitals and other users of the company s products to obtain reimbursement from third party payors  or changes in government and private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for procedures employing the company s products  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition
