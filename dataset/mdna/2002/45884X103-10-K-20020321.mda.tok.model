item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are developing and commercializing innovative products for the treatment of serious pulmonary and infectious diseases and cancer 
we have three marketed products  growing product revenues  and advanced stage clinical programs  addressing a range of diseases with attractive markets 
our three marketed products are actimmune  infergen and amphotec 
actimmune is approved in the united states for two rare congenital disorders 
we market infergen in the united states and canada for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c infections 
we market amphotec worldwide for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis 
our total product revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  since our inception  we have incurred significant losses and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our expenses have consisted primarily of those incurred for research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
we expect that our research and development expenses will increase as we continue clinical development of our products  and other expenses will increase as we expand our operations domestically and internationally 
as a result  we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
we have a limited history of operations and expect that our quarterly and annual results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including market acceptance of current or new products  patent conflicts  the introduction of new products by our competitors  the timing and extent of our research and development efforts  and the timing of significant orders 
our limited operating history makes accurate prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible 
drug development in the united states is a process that includes several steps defined by the fda 
the process begins with the filing of an initial drug application or ind which  if successful  allows opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase i  ii  and iii 
the most significant costs associated with clinical development are the phase iii trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
we currently have approximately two potential products in development that are in phase iii or are preparing for phase iii studies 
the successful development of our products is highly uncertain 
an estimation of product completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each product and are difficult to predict 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking these approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
in responding to a new drug application or nda or a biologic license application or bla  the fda may grant marketing approval  request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval 
we are pursuing the following product development programs program clinical status actimmune idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis phase iii trial ongoing cancer ovarian phase iii trial ongoing non hodgkin s lymphoma phase ii trial planned to commence in systemic fungal infections cryptococcal meningitis phase iii trial planned to commence in invasive aspergillosis phase ii trial planned to commence in liver fibrosis phase ii trial ongoing mycobacterial infections atypical mycobacterial infections phase ii trial ongoing cystic fibrosis phase ii trial ongoing next generation interferon gamma preclinical studies oritavancin complicated skin and skin structure infections phase iii trial ongoing nosocomial pneumonia two phase iii trials planned to commence in bacteremia phase ii trial ongoing infergen chronic hepatitis c infections multiple phase iv trials ongoing and planned to commence in peg infergen chronic hepatitis c infections preclinical studies moli duramycin cystic fibrosis phase i trial ongoing pa monoclonal antibody pseudomonas aeruginosa infection preclinical studies our objective is to become a leading global biopharmaceutical company 
we intend to grow our product revenues by capitalizing on the opportunities presented by our marketed products and by developing and commercializing new products 
during  we acquired the following product rights in october  we entered into an asset purchase and license agreement with eli lilly and company pursuant to which we acquired worldwide rights to oritavancin from eli lilly 
the agreement provides us with exclusive worldwide rights to develop  manufacture and commercialize oritavancin 
if we wish to enter into a relationship with a third party to commercialize oritavancin in any country  we must first offer eli lilly the opportunity to enter into such a commercialization relationship with us 
after we negotiate with eli lilly  the agreement prohibits us from entering into an agreement with a third party on more favorable terms than those we offered to eli lilly 
pursuant to the agreement  we paid eli lilly million and will be obligated to pay eli lilly significant milestone and royalty payments upon any successful development and commercialization of oritavancin by us 
from march through march  eli lilly has an option to reduce the agreed royalty percentages by requiring us to pay million to eli lilly 
our rights to oritavancin could revert to eli lilly if we do not meet our diligence obligations under the agreement or otherwise commit a material breach of the agreement 
additionally  if we are acquired by a company with a certain type of competing program and eli lilly has notified us prior to the acquisition that it believes in good faith that its economic interests in oritavancin under the agreement will be harmed in light of the acquisition  eli lilly may terminate the agreement and our rights to oritavancin would revert to eli lilly 
in any event  we may not assign the agreement to a potential acquirer without the advance  written consent of eli lilly 
in september  we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with maxygen holdings ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of maxygen  inc  to develop and commercialize novel  next generation interferon gamma products 
we plan to take forward into clinical development selected protein modified interferon gamma product candidates created by maxygen that have enhanced pharmacokinetics and a potential for less frequent dosing regimens 
we are funding optimization and development of the next generation interferon gamma products and retain exclusive worldwide commercialization rights for all human therapeutic indications 
under the terms of the agreement  maxygen received up front license fees and will receive full research funding and development and commercialization milestone payments 
in addition  maxygen will receive royalties on product sales 
our rights to the licensed products under the agreement could revert to maxygen if we do not meet our diligence obligations or otherwise commit a material breach of the agreement 
in june  we entered into a licensing and commercialization agreement with amgen to obtain an exclusive license in the united states and canada to infergen interferon alfacon  an interferon alpha product  and the rights to an early stage program to develop a pegylated form of infergen 
infergen is currently approved in both the united states and canada to treat chronic hepatitis c infections 
under the agreement  we will have the exclusive right to market infergen and clinically develop it for other indications in the united states and canada 
the total consideration was million for upfront license and other fees and near term milestones  and we are obligated to pay royalties on sales of infergen 
we are also required to pay amgen other milestone payments on the pegylated infergen program and royalties on sales of the product  if any 
our rights to infergen could revert to amgen if we do not meet our diligence obligations or otherwise commit a material breach of the agreement 
in may  we entered into a joint development and commercialization agreement for moli  a drug compound under development with molichem medicines  inc we paid an upfront license fee of million to molichem  and we are obligated to pay molichem one time payments on the achievement of certain milestones 
the parties will jointly fund the development and commercialization of moli for all diseases worldwide  starting with cystic fibrosis  sharing profits on any resulting products in proportion to the parties financial contribution to their development and commercialization 
molichem will lead the development efforts  and we will lead the commercialization efforts for moli in march  we formed an international strategic collaboration with boehringer ingelheim international gmbh  to develop and commercialize interferon gamma b under boehringer ingelheim s trade name  imukin  in all countries outside of the united states  canada and japan 
indications to be developed include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ipf  tuberculosis  systemic fungal infections  chronic granulomatous disease cgd  osteopetrosis and ovarian cancer  which was added as an indication in august by an amendment to the agreement 
under the agreement  intermune will fund and manage clinical and regulatory development of interferon gamma b for all indications 
boehringer ingelheim has an option to exclusively promote imukin  and we may opt to promote the product where boehringer ingelheim does not do so 
furthermore  both companies will share in the profits from commercializing interferon gamma b through a specified royalty schedule 
in january  we acquired worldwide rights from alza corporation to amphotec sold under the tradename amphocil in certain countries outside the united states 
the transaction terms included an upfront product acquisition fee of million  milestone payments based upon sales levels and specific achievements in the clinical development and regulatory approval of amphotec in combination with actimmune  and royalties payable upon net sales of amphotec 
under the agreement  we obtained access to certain existing distributorships for amphotec  and assumed alza s obligations under agreements with its existing amphotec distributors and service providers 
we have diligence obligations under the agreement to set up additional distributorships for amphotec or establish a sales force and begin to promote amphotec in specified countries at specified times 
our rights to amphotec could revert to alza if we do not meet our diligence obligations or otherwise commit a material breach of the agreement 
we are also subject to certain royalty obligations to the university of california under this agreement 
deferred stock compensation in connection with the grant of stock options to employees  we recorded deferred stock compensation totaling million and million in the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
no deferred stock compensation was recorded for deferred stock compensation for options granted to employees has been determined as the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes on the date such options were granted and the applicable exercise prices 
such amount is included as a reduction of stockholders equity and is being amortized using the graded vesting method over the vesting period of the individual options  which is generally five years 
this graded vesting method provides for vesting of portions of the overall award at interim dates and results in higher vesting in earlier years than straight line vesting 
we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   we had a total of million to be amortized over the remaining vesting periods of the stock options 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenue 
total product revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the growth in product sales for the year is primarily attributable to a million increase in sales of actimmune 
the product revenues in include all sales of actimmune in the united states  worldwide sales of amphotec for the period from january  the date we acquired the marketing rights to amphotec and sales of infergen in the united states for the period from june  the date we acquired the marketing rights to infergen 
the product revenues in include only sales of actimmune outside the united states related to a supply arrangement and for the period from april  to december  in the united states 
on june   we terminated the annual baseline agreement with connetics for actimmune sales below a contractual baseline 
for the three month period ended march   sales transacted for connetics below the annual contractual baseline were recorded on a net basis  which was zero  and any amounts in excess of net revenues less costs to produce and market were paid to connetics 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of goods sold includes manufacturing costs  royalties and distribution costs associated with our revenues 
the increase in was due entirely to costs associated with increased product sales volumes 
amortization of acquired product rights 
we recorded amortization of acquired product rights of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on june   we purchased rights to all of the actimmune revenues and related expenses that we had previously transacted for connetics 
the amortization of those rights was completed in and expensed based upon product units shipped under the previous contractual unit baseline for the year in addition  we recognized a total of million in for the amortization of product rights acquired in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of or million 
of the increased costs in the year  a total of million is related to non cash stock based compensation and the amortization of deferred stock compensation and million was incurred for one time payments relating to technology licenses and a common stock investment in a privately held company 
the remaining increase in was due primarily to increased costs for clinical trial expenses for actimmune in new and existing disease indications and internal support personnel 
our clinical research and development costs approximated of our total research and development expense and our preclinical research and development costs approximated of the same total 
we expect research and development expenses to increase significantly over the next several years 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of or million 
of the increased costs in  a total of million is related to non cash stock based compensation and the amortization of deferred stock compensation 
the remaining increase in is attributable primarily to increased staffing and related expenses necessary to manage the growth of our operations  expansion of our field sales force and the expansion into our new company headquarters 
in december  we added additional field personnel to support our products 
we believe that selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as a result of the anticipated expansion of our administrative staff and increased marketing and selling expenses for our products in their approved diseases  and the expenses associated with the expansion of our operations worldwide 
acquired in process research and development 
we recorded one time charges for acquired in process research and development of million for the year ended december  related to the acquisition of infergen and oritavancin no charges in 
in october  we licensed worldwide rights to oritavancin from eli lilly and company 
we paid an upfront fee of million to lilly and an additional million in related expenses 
we will also pay lilly significant milestone and royalty payments upon successful development and commercialization 
oritavancin is not currently approved by the fda and is in phase ii and phase iii clinical trials for various indications 
we expect commercial no earlier than in june  we entered into a licensing and commercialization agreement with amgen inc and obtained an exclusive license in the united states and canada to infergen a therapeutic approved by the fda for the treatment of hepatitis c infections and the rights to an early stage program to develop a pegylated form of infergen for a total consideration of million  plus development milestones and royalties 
under the agreement  we also have the exclusive right to clinically develop infergen for other indications in the united states and canada 
we do not expect the pegylated infergen program  which is currently in its early stages approximately completed  to reach the fda approval stage until at the earliest  if at all 
based upon an independent appraisal  the fair value of the in process research and development program for pegylated infergen was million 
the remainder of the purchase price of approximately million  was allocated to developed technology and will be amortized over ten years 
the value assigned to acquired in process research and development was determined by estimating the costs to develop amgen s purchased in process research and development into a commercially viable product  currently estimated to be approximately million including development milestones  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the project and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
a discount rate of was used for valuing the in process research and development and is intended to be commensurate with our corporate maturity and the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above 
the technology under development has no foreseeable alternative future use 
the estimates used by us in valuing in process research and development were based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
our assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and no assurance can be given that unanticipated events and circumstances will not occur 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results 
interest income 
interest income totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income in was due to increased cash available for investments as a result of the completion of debt and equity financings during the year  offset by lower interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense totaled million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in was attributable to interest expense on our aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes issued during the year 
the amount in relates to imputed interest on the obligations to connetics that were paid in full on march deemed dividend upon issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock 
we recorded a deemed dividend of million in january  upon the issuance of  shares of series b redeemable convertible preferred stock 
at the dates of issuance  we believed the per share price of represented the fair value of the preferred stock and was in excess of the deemed fair value of our common stock 
subsequent to the commencement of our initial public offering process  we re evaluated the deemed fair value of our common stock and determined it to be to per share 
accordingly  the aggregate proceeds of million fair value is deemed to be the equivalent of a preferred stock dividend 
we recorded the deemed dividend at the date of issuance by offsetting charges and credits to additional paid in capital of million  without any effect on total stockholders equity 
the amount increased the loss applicable to common stockholders in the calculation of basic net loss per share the year ended december  provision for income taxes 
due to operating losses and the inability to recognize the benefits therefrom  there is no provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized and federal research and development tax credits of approximately  which will expire in the years through utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization 
comparison of years ended december  and revenue 
total product revenues were million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the product revenues in represented our portion of actimmune sales that exceeded the annual contractual baseline established with connetics in effect at that time 
on june   we terminated the annual baseline agreement with connetics for actimmune sales below a contractual baseline 
beginning with the three month period ending june   our revenues reflect all sales for actimmune 
the product revenues in represent all sales from april  to december  of actimmune in the united states and sales outside the united states related to a supply arrangement

research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of or million 
of the increased costs in the year  a total of million is related to non cash stock based compensation and the amortization of deferred stock compensation 
the remaining increase in was due primarily to increased costs for clinical trial expenses for actimmune in new disease indications and the expenses associated with our transfer of actimmune to an additional manufacturing facility 
these costs have been recorded as research and development expenses as the new facility is not yet operational 
we expect research and development expenses to increase significantly over the next several years 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of or million 
of the increased costs in  a total of million is related to the amortization of deferred stock compensation

accordingly  the aggregate proceeds of million fair value is deemed to be the equivalent of a preferred stock dividend 
we recorded the deemed dividend at the date of issuance by offsetting charges and credits to additional paid in capital of million  without any effect on total stockholders equity 
the amount increased the loss applicable to common stockholders in the calculation of basic net loss per share the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations through sales of equity and debt securities and sales of our products 
at december   we had available cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments of million 
our cash reserves are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments including obligations of us government agencies  high grade corporate bonds  commercial paper and money market accounts

in addition  net cash used in operations for the year ended december   was further impacted by an increase in accounts receivable of million resulting from increased product sales and an increase in product inventories of million 
these uses of operating cash were offset by an increase of million in accounts payable and accrued compensation resulting from increases in commissions and vacation liabilities from additional personnel added during the year and an increase of million in other accrued liabilities  which includes million of interest payable on the convertible subordinated debt and million payable to amgen  inc for the acquisition on infergen

the offering allows for an over allotment provision of  shares that may be purchased by the underwriters during the next days 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  together with cash flows from our operations will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements through at least the end of however  our capital requirements may increase in future periods and as a result  we may require additional funds 
we may attempt to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources 
we have no commitments for any additional financings and additional funding may not be available to finance our operations when needed or  if available  the terms for obtaining such funds may not be favorable or may result in dilution to our stockholders 
our material future obligations are as follows in millions contractual obligations total after convertible subordinated debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations research and development funding commitments total contractual cash obligations critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and related revenue reserves 
estimates are based on historical experience  information received from third parties and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition and revenue reserves revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and final  delivery has occurred and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment 
revenue is recognized at shipment and reserves are recorded for estimated returns  rebates and cash discounts 
we are obligated to accept from customers the return of pharmaceuticals that have reached their expiration date 
we monitor product ordering cycles and actual returns  product date codes and wholesale inventory levels to estimate potential product return rates 
we have not experienced any significant returns of expired products to date 
we monitor all sales of products and estimate a reserve for those sales subject to rebates 
accounting for intangible assets our intangible assets are comprised principally of acquired technology rights 
we apply judgment in determining the useful lives of our intangible assets and whether such assets are impaired 
factors we consider include the life of the underlying patent  the expected period of benefit from the use of the technology  existence of competing technology and potential obsolescence 
to date  we have not experienced any impairments to our intangible assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective january  sfas provides for  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
sfas also requires us to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test six months from the date of adoption 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  sfas provides a single accounting model for  and supersedes previous guidance on  accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas sets new criteria for the classification of an assets held for sale and changes the reporting of discontinued operations 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio of depository accounts  master notes and liquidity optimized investment contracts 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are  due to their very short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
at december   the average maturity of our available for sale securities was days 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest its excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restricts its exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of generally less than two years
