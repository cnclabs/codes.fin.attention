item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations micron technology  inc  and its subsidiaries hereinafter referred to collectively as the company principally design  develop  manufacture and market semiconductor products 
the following discussion contains trend information and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements such as those made in critical accounting policies and income taxes regarding the modest levels of foreign taxation that the company expects to be reflected in the income tax provision in future periods  in gross margin regarding the estimated amount of write down remaining in inventory at the end of the first quarter of  the estimated gross margins on tech products in the first quarter of and the per megabit cost associated with products manufactured at the company s virginia facility  and in liquidity and capital resources regarding capital spending in the company s actual results could differ materially from the company s historical results and those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to  those identified in certain factors 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
all period references are to the company s fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated 
per share amounts for reflect a two for one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend on may  all per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
estimates and judgments are based on historical experience  forecasted future events and various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates and judgments may differ under different assumptions or conditions 
the company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
management believes the critical accounting policies below are the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
income taxes the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
the company currently has significant deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards which will offset taxable income in future periods 
us gaap requires the assessment of the company s performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets 
the company s ability to realize deferred tax assets is dependent on its ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to utilize loss carryforwards or tax credits before their expiration 
in the evaluation of realizability of deferred tax assets  factors such as recent losses are given substantially more weight than forecasted future profitability 
a valuation allowance was established in the fourth quarter of for the company s us deferred tax assets  resulting in a million charge to the provision for income taxes 
the company expects that until it utilizes these operating loss carryforwards the consolidated income tax provision will only reflect modest levels of foreign taxation 
the company is also required to estimate income tax provisions and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous jurisdictions around the world 
such estimates involve significant interpretations of regulations and are inherently very complex 
resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value 
cost includes labor  material and overhead costs  including product and process technology costs 
determining market value of inventories requires judgment in that it requires the company to project unit prices and volumes for future periods in which it expects to sell the inventory 
as a result of these analyses  the company records a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold to reflect market values that are below the company s costs 
due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry  actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes 
as a result  the timing of when product cost are charged to operations can vary significantly 
us gaap provides for inventory to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market values 
the amount of any inventory write down can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories 
the majority of the company s inventory has been categorized as volatile dram and sram or non volatile flash 
the major characteristics the company considers in determining inventory categories are product type and markets 
product and process technology costs incurred to acquire product and process technology or to patent technology developed by the company are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over periods currently ranging up to years 
the company capitalizes a portion of costs incurred based on its analysis of historical and projected patent issuance rates 
capitalized product and process technology costs are amortized over the shorter of i the estimated useful life of the technology the determination of which requires judgment by the company  ii the patent term or iii the term of the technology agreement 
from time to time  others have asserted  and may in the future assert  that the company s products or processes infringe their product or process technology rights 
the company accrues a liability and charges operations for the estimated costs of settlement or adjudication of asserted and unasserted claims for alleged infringement prior to the balance sheet date 
however  it is difficult to predict the actual costs of settlement or adjudication 
property  plant and equipment the company reviews the carrying value of property  plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and or eventual disposition 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss would be recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the indicated fair value of the assets 
the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by the company  including  but not limited to  future use of the assets for company operations versus sale or disposal of the assets  future selling prices for the company s products and future sales volumes 
research and development costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as research and development 
determining when product development is deemed complete requires judgment by the company 
the company deems that development of a product is complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed  tested for performance and reliability and is internally qualified for sale to customers 
subsequent to product qualification  product costs are valued in inventory 
recent events on april   the company acquired substantially all of the assets of toshiba corporation s toshiba dram operations at dominion semiconductor llc in virginia

net sales the company s results of operations for and were significantly affected by declines in average selling prices for its semiconductor memory products of for as compared to and for as compared to the decreases in average selling prices led to significantly lower net sales and to charges to cost of goods sold for write downs of the company s work in process and finished goods inventories totaling million in and million in net sales for decreased by as compared to  primarily due to the decline in average selling prices for the company s semiconductor products 
total megabits of semiconductor memory sold increased by approximately in as compared to net sales decreased by in as compared to  primarily due to the decline in average selling prices for the company s semiconductor memory products 
total megabits of semiconductor memory sold increased by approximately for the same period 
the company achieved higher megabit sales through shifts to higher density products  ongoing transitions to smaller die size versions of existing memory products shrink versions  and  in  increases in total wafer outs 
in the fourth quarter of  the company transitioned from the meg synchronous dram sdram to the meg double data rate ddr sdram as it s primary product in production 
the company s overall primary product in was the meg sdram which constituted of net sales 
gross margin change change amounts in millions gross margin  as a of net sales the company s gross margin percentages decreased in and the declines in gross margin were primarily due to the decreases in average selling prices per megabit of memory and the effects of inventory write downs  partially offset by reductions in per megabit manufacturing costs for the company s semiconductor products 
in recent quarters  average selling prices for the company s semiconductor products have been below manufacturing costs  and accordingly the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial condition have been adversely affected 
to the extent the estimated market value of products held in finished goods and work in process inventories at a quarter end date is below the cost of these products  the company recognizes a charge to cost of goods sold to write down the carrying value of inventory to the estimated market value 
in this regard  in and  the company recorded charges to cost of goods sold to write down the carrying value of its inventories to their estimated market values 
as these charges are recorded in advance of when inventory subject to the write down is sold  gross margins in the period of sale are higher than they would be absent the effect of the previous write downs 
excluding the effects on gross margin of inventory write downs  gross margin for would have been lower by million and gross margin for would have been higher by million 
results of operations for the fourth quarter of include an inventory write down of million 
approximately of this write down related to the company s sdram products  including products from the company s newly acquired facility in virginia 
of the cumulative inventory write downs recognized in and  the company estimates that approximately million is associated with product remaining in inventory as of august  the company estimates that approximately of this amount will remain in inventory at the end of the first quarter of subject to specific terms and conditions  the company has agreed to purchase all of the products manufactured by its joint venture memory manufacturing operation  tech semiconductor singapore pte 
ltd 
tech 
tech supplied approximately  and of the total megabits of memory produced by the company in  and  respectively 
the company generally purchases semiconductor products from tech at prices determined quarterly  based on a discount from average selling price realized by the company for the immediately preceding quarter 
depending on market conditions  the gross margin from the sale of tech products may be higher or lower than the gross margin from the sale of products manufactured by the company s wholly owned facilities 
the company realized significantly higher gross margin percentages on sales of tech products than for products manufactured by its wholly owned facilities in and lower gross margins on sales of tech products for and in light of continuing pricing declines occurring since early april  the company expects gross margins on sales of tech products in the first quarter of to be higher than gross margins realized on products manufactured by the company s wholly owned operations 
the company performs assembly and test services on products manufactured by tech 
the company also provides certain technology  engineering  and training support to tech 
all transactions with tech are recognized as part of the net cost of products purchased from tech 
a limited amount of the company s production for was attributable to its virginia facility 
the company expects to transition its product and process technology into this facility over the next three to six months 
until the company is able to complete the transition of its product and process technology and significantly ramp production at the virginia facility  the company expects that the per megabit costs associated with products manufactured at the facility will exceed the per megabit costs of products manufactured at the company s other facilities 
selling  general and administrative change change amounts in millions selling  general and administrative as a of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased in as compared to sg a for included a contribution charge of million for the market value of the company s equity interest in interland which was contributed to the micron technology foundation and million from the company s web hosting operations  which were disposed of in august in addition  technical and professional fees associated with the implementation of the company s business software and legal costs associated with product and process technology rights litigation were lower in as compared to see item financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies 
the increase in sg a for as compared to resulted primarily from the million contribution charge 
the increase in sg a for as compared to was also due to increased legal costs associated with product and process technology rights litigation  patent prosecution and depreciation expense associated with the company s business software systems  partially offset by decreased performance based compensation expense 
sg a for the company s web hosting operations was and of total sg a for and  respectively 
research and development change change amounts in millions research and development as a of net sales research and development expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed  the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development  and personnel costs 
product development costs are recorded as research and development expense 
development of a product is deemed complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability and is internally qualified for sale to customers 
the company s dram process technology research and development efforts are focused on its 
and 
line width process technologies  which are designed to facilitate the company s transition to next generation products 
additional process development work includes processes to support flash  sram  cmos imagers  content addressable memory cam  embedded memory and new memory materials 
in addition to its process technology efforts  the company continues to emphasize product designs that utilize advanced process technology 
efforts towards the design and development of new products are concentrated on the company s meg and gig ddr sdrams  ddrii and ddriii sdrams  flash and sram memory products  cellularram  embedded memory  cam  cmos imagers and advanced dram technology products 
the company is establishing a pilot line to process limited volumes of millimeter mm wafers 
other operating income and expense other operating expense for includes losses of million  net of gains  on write downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment 
other operating expense for includes losses of million from the write off of certain costs associated with the company s lehi facility and losses of million  net of gains  on write downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment 
other operating income for includes a gain of million on the sale of the company s facility located in richardson  texas and losses of million  net of gains  on write downs and disposals of other semiconductor equipment 
other non operating income and expense in the fourth quarter of  the company contributed its interest in its interland web hosting operations to the micron technology foundation 
other non operating expense for includes a million loss in connection with the merger of micron electronics  inc formerly a subsidiary of the company and interland  inc and a charge of million to write down the carrying value of the company s equity interest in interland contributed to the foundation to market value 
in addition  the company recognized charges totaling million in resulting from market value adjustments for derivative financial instruments to purchase electricity and natural gas 
other non operating income for includes a gain of million from the contribution to the foundation of interland common stock owned by the company 
interest income and expense interest income fluctuates primarily with levels of the company s cash and investments and general rates of interest 
interest expense was relatively flat in compared to and was lower for as compared to  primarily as a result of the conversions of debt to equity in the third quarter of and the first quarter of million of the company s convertible subordinated notes were converted into equity in the third quarter of and the company s million face amount  convertible subordinated notes were converted into equity in the first quarter of income taxes the company recorded a million charge in to the provision for income taxes to establish a valuation allowance against its us deferred tax assets  consisting primarily of billion of us net operating loss carryforwards 
until the company utilizes these operating loss carryforwards the income tax provision will only reflect modest levels of foreign taxation 
excluding the million charge  the effective tax rate for would have been 
the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate excluding the valuation allowance primarily reflects the us statutory income tax rate  the net effect of state taxes and the effect of foreign income at non us tax rates

liquidity and capital resources as of august   the company had cash and short term investments totaling million  representing a decrease of million from august  in addition  the company had investment securities with maturities of more than one year totaling million as of august  and million as of august   which are included in other noncurrent assets in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company s liquidity is highly dependent on overall industry demand for semiconductor memory and average selling prices for its semiconductor products 
the company s principal source of liquidity during was net cash flow from operations of million  which includes income tax refunds of million received by the company in the first quarter of during  the company spent million for property  plant and equipment and also paid million in cash to toshiba as part of the cost to acquire the virginia facility 
the company believes that to develop new product and process technologies  support future growth  achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality  it must continue to invest in manufacturing technology  facilities and capital equipment  research and development  and product and process technology 
this investment may also be accomplished through business acquisitions or other transactions 
the company has historically utilized external sources of financing to fund a portion of operations and has a shelf registration statement in place pursuant to which the company may from time to time issue debt or equity securities for up to billion 
the company may also seek to raise funds through issuing securities not covered by the existing shelf registration statement  by increasing the size of the existing shelf registration statement or pursuing other external sources of financing 
the company expects capital spending to approximate million to billion in depending on market conditions 
these capital spending estimates include expenditures for ongoing equipment upgrades  expenditures to transition the company s virginia facility to the company s process technology and expenditures for the mm pilot line 
as of august   the company had commitments extending into of approximately million for the acquisition of property  plant and equipment 
in connection with the acquisition of the virginia facility  the company issued million shares of common stock 
the company granted toshiba an option to require micron to repurchase on october   all of these shares for million cash 
the option expires if the closing price of the company s common stock is at or above per share for consecutive trading days 
the company has pledged million  which is included in other noncurrent assets in the company s consolidated balance sheet  as cash collateral for tech s fully drawn revolving line of credit 
future payments on notes and capital lease obligations and minimum commitments under operating leases are fiscal year notes capital leases operating leases and thereafter certain factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form k  the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
if average selling prices for our semiconductor products do not exceed our costs  we expect to incur losses 
in five of the last six fiscal years we experienced the following decreases in average selling prices for our semiconductor products in  in  in  in and in we are unable to predict pricing conditions for any future period 
in recent quarters  average selling prices for our semiconductor products have been below our manufacturing costs  and accordingly  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition have been adversely affected 
if average selling prices are below costs in future periods  we expect to continue to incur losses on product sales 
to the extent the estimated market value of products held in finished goods and work in process inventories at a quarter end date is below the cost of these products  we recognize a charge against operations to write down the carrying value of inventory to market value 
if average selling prices of semiconductor products do not improve  we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments 
our cash flows from operations depend primarily on demand for semiconductor memory  average selling prices and per megabit manufacturing costs 
in recent quarters  average selling prices have been below our manufacturing costs 
to develop new product and process technologies  support future growth  achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality  we must make significant capital investments in facilities and capital equipment  research and development  and product and process technology 
weak market conditions for the semiconductor industry have led us to significantly reduce actual and projected expenditures 
if average selling prices do not improve  we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations or make adequate capital investments 
weak demand for semiconductor memory products may lead to future inventory write downs or limit our ability to sell our products 
we recorded inventory write downs totaling million in and million in as a result of the significant decreases in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products 
to the extent the estimated market value of products held in finished goods and work in process inventories at a quarter end date is below the cost of these products  we recognize a charge to cost of goods sold to write down the carrying value of inventory to market value 
in addition  if a lack of demand for semiconductor products limits our ability to sell our inventory  our liquidity and financial position could be adversely affected 
if the growth rate of either pcs sold or the amount of semiconductor memory included in each pc decreases  sales of our semiconductor products could decrease 
we are dependent on the personal computer pc market as most of the semiconductor products we sell are used in pcs or peripherals 
drams are the most widely used semiconductor components in pcs 
in recent quarters  the growth rate of pcs sold has slowed or declined 
if we experience a sustained reduction in the growth rate of either pcs sold or the average amount of semiconductor memory included in each pc  sales of our semiconductor products could decrease  and our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive 
we face intense competition from a number of companies  some of which are large corporations or conglomerates eg samsung semiconductor  inc that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor memory market  invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities 
current economic and political conditions may harm our business 
global economic conditions and the effects of military or terrorist actions may cause significant disruptions to worldwide commerce 
if these disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  a decrease in corporate spending on information technology or our inability to effectively market  manufacture or ship our products  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in addition  our ability to raise capital for capital expenditures  research and development and ongoing operations is dependent upon ready access to capital markets 
during times of adverse global economic and political conditions  accessibility to capital markets could decrease 
if we are unable to access the capital markets over an extended period of time  we may be unable to make capital expenditures  fully carry out our research and development efforts and fund operations  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
if any one of our major pc customers significantly reduces its purchases of dram from us  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
approximately of the company s sales of semiconductor products for was to the computer market 
aggregate sales to two of our pc customers approximated of our net sales in if any one of our major pc customers significantly reduces its purchases of dram from us  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
increased worldwide dram production could lead to further declines in average selling prices for dram 
the transition to smaller geometries and the widespread use of millimeter mm wafers in the industry  which is expected to occur within the next two to five years  could lead to a significant increase in the worldwide supply of dram 
increases in worldwide supply of dram also result from dram fab capacity expansions  either by way of new facilities  increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to dram production 
some of our competitors may receive government support to withstand downturns in the semiconductor memory market and to invest in technology resulting in increased worldwide supply 
increases in worldwide supply of dram  if not offset by increases in demand  could lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
if our tech joint venture experiences financial difficulty  or if our supply of semiconductor products from tech is disrupted  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
tech supplied approximately  and of our total megabits of memory produced in  and  respectively 
we have agreements to purchase all of the production from tech subject to specific terms and conditions 
any reduction in supply could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
tech s existing credit facility expires in december  and tech is currently seeking external financing to replace its maturing loans and fund ongoing operations 
if tech s financing efforts are unsuccessful  we and other tech shareholders may be requested to invest additional capital in tech 
if tech is unable to obtain new financing or additional capital from its shareholders  it would likely have to discontinue capital spending and may have to alter its operations 
we have pledged million as cash collateral for tech s fully drawn line of credit 
as of august   we had remaining unamortized costs of million included in intangible assets relating to the supply arrangement to purchase product from tech 
in the event that our supply of semiconductor products from tech is reduced or eliminated  the company may be required to write off part or all of these assets and the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
we may face difficulties integrating our newly acquired virginia facility 
on april   we acquired substantially all the assets of toshiba s dram business as conducted by dominion semiconductor llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of toshiba located in virginia 
the success of these operations is partially dependent on our ability to operate them in a cost effective manner 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully integrate these operations and operate them in a cost effective manner 
until we are able to complete the transition of our product and process technology and significantly ramp production at the virginia facility  we expect that the per megabit costs associated with products manufactured at the facility will exceed the per megabit costs of products manufactured at our other facilities 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving the same level of manufacturing efficiencies in the virginia facility as has been achieved in our other manufacturing facilities 
we may be unable to maintain or reduce per megabit manufacturing costs at the same rate as we have in the past 
historically  we have decreased per megabit manufacturing costs through improvements in our manufacturing processes  including reducing the die size of our existing products 
in future periods  we may be unable to maintain our per megabit manufacturing costs or reduce costs at historical rates 
our ability to maintain or reduce per megabit manufacturing costs in future periods may be affected by our ability to successfully implement product and process technology upgrades  our manufacturing wafer output or yields may decrease as we implement more complex technologies  and our ability to ramp the latest reduced die size versions of existing devices or new generation devices 
if we are unable to respond to customer demand for continued diversification of semiconductor products or are unable to do so in a cost effective manner  we may lose market share and our results of operations may be adversely affected 
we will need to dedicate significant resources to product design and development to respond to customer demand for continued diversification of semiconductor products 
if we are unable to invest sufficient resources to meet the diverse memory needs of customers  we may lose market share 
in addition  as we diversify our product lines we may encounter difficulties penetrating certain markets  particularly markets where we do not have existing customers 
if we are unable to respond to customer demand for market diversification in a cost effective manner  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
an adverse determination that our products and processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
from time to time  others have asserted  and may in the future assert  that our products or processes infringe their product or process technology rights 
in this regard  we are currently engaged in litigation with rambus  inc rambus relating to certain of rambus patents and certain of our claims and defenses 
on august   we filed a declaratory judgment action against rambus in the us district court for the district of delaware 
on february   we amended our complaint 
pursuant to our amended complaint  we are seeking relief under the federal antitrust laws for violations by rambus of section of the sherman act  a declaratory judgment that a certain rambus patents are not infringed  are invalid and or are unenforceable  b we have an implied license to rambus patents  and c rambus is estopped from enforcing its patents against us because of its conduct in the joint electron device engineering council standards setting body  and damages and declaratory relief for rambus breach of contract  fraud  deceptive trade practices  negligent misrepresentation  and conduct requiring the application of equitable estoppel 
on february   rambus filed an answer and counterclaim denying that we are entitled to relief and has alleged willful infringement by us of eight rambus patents 
in addition  rambus has filed lawsuits against the company in italy  germany  france and the united kingdom alleging infringement of certain rambus european patents 
we are unable to predict the outcome of these suits 
a court determination that our manufacturing processes or products infringe the product or process rights of others could result in significant liability and or require us to make material changes to our products and or manufacturing processes 
any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements 
some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments 
we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future 
we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms 
allegations of anticompetitive practices 
on june   we received a grand jury subpoena from the us district court for the northern district of california seeking information regarding an investigation by the antitrust division of the department of justice the doj into possible antitrust violations in the dynamic random access memory or dram industry 
we are cooperating fully with the doj in its investigation 
subsequent to the commencement of the doj investigation  purported class action lawsuits were filed against us and other dram suppliers in various federal and state courts alleging violations of the federal sherman antitrust act or california s cartwright antitrust act and unfair competition law relating to the sale and pricing of dram products 
the complaints seek treble damages for the alleged damages sustained by purported class members  in addition to restitution  costs and attorneys fees  as well as an injunction against the allegedly unlawful conduct 
there can be no assurance that additional purported class action lawsuits will not be filed against us  either within or without the united states 
we are unable to predict the outcome of these suits 
a court determination that the company has violated federal or state antitrust laws could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
new product development may not be successful 
we are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology 
we anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years 
there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successful  that we will be able to cost effectively manufacture these new products or that we will be able to successfully market these products 
if we are unable to successfully transition our operations to mm wafer manufacturing processes  the results of our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we have in the past reduced our per megabit manufacturing costs by transitioning to larger wafer sizes 
by transitioning to larger wafers  we should be able to produce significantly more die for each wafer  resulting in substantially reduced costs for each die 
we and several of our competitors are evaluating plans to shift part or all of our semiconductor manufacturing operations to mm wafers  and some of our competitors have begun to shift their operations to mm wafers 
our transition to mm wafer processing will require us to make substantial capital investments  which will depend on our ability to generate funds from operations or to obtain funds from external sources 
we may also experience disruptions in manufacturing operations and reduced yields during our transition to larger wafer sizes 
if we are unable to successfully transition to mm wafer processing at the appropriate time  we could be at a cost disadvantage with respect to our competitors and our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
sales to customers outside the united states approximated of our consolidated net sales in in addition  we have or support manufacturing operations in italy  japan  scotland and singapore 
our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks  including currency fluctuations  export duties  changes to import and export regulations  and restrictions on the transfer of funds  political and economic instability  problems with the transportation or delivery of our products  issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  and compliance with trade and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions 
these factors may adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
if our manufacturing process is disrupted  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance 
difficulties in the manufacturing process can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per megabit manufacturing costs 
from time to time  we have experienced minor disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages 
if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason  manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers 
this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs  loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships 
disruptions in our supply of raw materials could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards 
we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials 
however  only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards 
various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers  photomasks  chemicals  gases  lead frames and molding compound 
shortages may occur from time to time in the future 
in addition  any transportation problems could delay our receipt of raw materials 
lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past 
if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
products that do not meet specifications or that contain  or are perceived by our customers to contain  defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
because the design and production process for semiconductor memory is highly complex  it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications  contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses 
if  despite design review  quality control and product qualification procedures  problems with nonconforming  defective or incompatible products occur after we have shipped such products  we could be adversely affected in the following ways we may need to replace product or otherwise compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product  and we may encounter adverse publicity  which could cause a decrease in sales of our products 
we expect to make future acquisitions where advisable  which involve numerous risks 
we expect to make future acquisitions where we believe it is advisable to enhance our market position 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including increasing our exposure to changes in average selling prices for semiconductor memory products  difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities  increasing debt to finance any acquisition  diverting management s attention from normal daily operations  managing larger operations and facilities and employees in separate geographic areas  and hiring and retaining key employees 
mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and future acquisitions may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition
