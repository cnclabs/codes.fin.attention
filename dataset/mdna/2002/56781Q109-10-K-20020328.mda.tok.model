item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
for a more complete understanding of our financial condition and results of operations  and some of the risks that could affect future results  see other factors affecting operating results  liquidity and capital resources which begins on page and the risks discussed in our most recent filings with the securities and exchange commission 
overview marimba is a leading provider of systems management software built for e business 
we develop  market and support end to end change and configuration management software solutions 
our desktop mobile management  server management and embedded management product families provide an efficient and reliable way for enterprises to distribute  update and manage applications and related data to desktops  laptops  servers and devices 
our products help customers reduce their total cost of ownership and improve quality of service by streamlining the distribution and management of applications and content 
in january  we released our first version of the desktop mobile management products and since that time have continued to develop and market that product line and enhance the core desktop mobile management infrastructure with additional functionality and complimentary add on products 
in the first half of  marimba introduced a new product line called server management 
the server management products are designed to address many of the server management challenges inherent in thin client and web commerce computing environments today 
additionally  marimba offers embedded management products that allow device and software vendors to deliver software fixes  new features and services by embedding marimba software management capabilities into their devices or applications 
during  revenues from the desktop mobile  server and embedded management products lines accounted for  and of total license revenues  respectively 
revenues to date have been derived primarily from the license of our products and to a lesser extent from support and maintenance  consulting and training services 
customers who license our products generally purchase maintenance contracts  typically covering a month period 
additionally  customers may purchase consulting services  which are customarily billed at a fixed daily rate plus out of pocket expenses 
we also offer training services that are billed on a per student or per class session basis 
since inception  we have made substantial investments in sales  marketing and research and development to expand and enhance our product lines and increase the market awareness of marimba and our products 
we have incurred significant losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit of approximately million at december  we believe that our success depends on further increasing our customer base and on growth in our market overall 
accordingly  over the long term  we intend to continue to invest heavily in sales  marketing and research and development 
in view of the rapidly changing nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance  growth or financial results 
additionally  we do not believe that historical growth rates or profitability are necessarily sustainable  nor indicative of future growth or financial results 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
discussion and analysis of marimba s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts and litigation 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
we follow detailed guidelines discussed below and in note to the consolidated financial statements in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
we are required to exercise judgment in evaluating the risk of concession when our payment terms are outside of our customary credit period of days or less 
assessment of collectibility is particularly critical in determining whether or not revenue should be recognized in the current difficult economic environment 
we also record small provisions for estimated sales returns and warranty claims in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns and warranty claims  which have been relatively limited 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns or warranty claims  revenue could be overstated or cost of revenues could be understated 
marimba derives its revenues primarily from two sources i license revenues  which consist of software license fees and ii service revenues  which are comprised of fees for maintenance and support  consulting and training 
maintenance and support agreements provide technical support and the right to unspecified upgrades on an if and when available basis 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
marimba applies the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions to all transactions involving the sale of software products 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
sab outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosures related to revenue recognition policies 
marimba applied the provisions of sab to all revenue transactions for fiscal and sab has not had a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for nonmonetary transactions  marimba records barter transactions at the fair value of the goods or services provided or received  whichever is more readily determinable in the circumstances 
to date  revenues from barter transactions have been insignificant and represent less than of net revenues 
marimba licenses software products to corporate customers  oem partners and resellers on a perpetual basis or a term basis 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
marimba uses either a definitive customer purchase order or signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
license revenues in arrangements with customers who are not the ultimate users  primarily resellers  are not recognized until the software is sold through to the end user 
advance payments from resellers for guaranteed minimum commitments are deferred until the software is sold through to the end user or upon expiration of the specified commitment time period if the minimum commitments have not been met 
delivery generally occurs when license keys and passwords have been made available to the customer through e mail 
at the time of the transaction  marimba assesses whether the fee associated with revenue transactions is fixed and determinable and whether or not collection is probable 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and our history with the customer or with similar customers 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  we generally account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  marimba recognizes revenue as the fees become due 
marimba assesses the probability of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  undelivered maintenance and support  marimba allocates revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to marimba 
this means that we defer revenue from the arrangement fee equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair values for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations for our licenses are based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers 
fair value of services  such as training or consulting  is based upon separate sales by us of these services to other customers 
most of our arrangements involve multiple obligations 
marimba s arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  acceptance occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
marimba recognizes revenues for maintenance and support ratably over the maintenance term  which is generally one year 
consulting services are generally billed based on daily rates and training services are generally billed on per student or per class session basis 
we generally recognize consulting and training revenues as the services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established through a charge to the general and administrative expenses 
this allowance is for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
it is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer base  age of the receivable balances  both individually and in aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay or suggest that a particular market sector is more prone to liquidity issues 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  subsequent to the date of our arrangements with them  this could result in an impairment of their ability to make payments and additional allowances would be required 
litigation contingencies 
we are a party to the two legal actions described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
marimba has not provided for reserves for potential losses in these actions due to an adverse judgment or outcome  because such events have not been determined to be probable nor can the contingent losses be reasonably estimated at this time 
the requirement to provide for future reserves  if any  may change due to new developments in each action 
results of operations the following table presents selected financial data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenues 
year ended december  consolidated statement of operations data revenues license service total revenues cost of revenues license service total cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring costs amortization of deferred compensation 
total operating expenses loss from operations interest income and other expenses  net loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss years ended december   and revenues total revenues in were million  comparable to revenues in of million 
total revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in license revenues 
to date  the majority of marimba s license revenues have been derived from sales of our desktop mobile management products 
for the year ended december   revenues from sales of our desktop mobile  server and embedded management products lines accounted for approximately  and of total license revenues  respectively 
for the year ended december   revenues from sales of our desktop mobile and server management products represented and of license revenues 
prior to  marimba did not separately account for its embedded management products and sales of these products were included with the desktop mobile management product line 
license revenues decreased million  or  to million in from million in license revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in license revenues from to was due primarily to delays in anticipated customer purchases and generally longer sales cycles caused by the general economic weakness in the unites states and europe 
also  marimba experienced generally low productivity from its sales force and replaced many unproductive sales personnel 
we typically expect that a new sales representative will take six months or longer to achieve full productivity 
license revenues increased from to due primarily to increased product licenses sold  reflecting higher customer demand for our desktop mobile management products  the introduction of our server management products in  additional sales to existing customers and overall growth of our sales organization 
service revenues 
service revenues include maintenance and support  consulting and training 
service revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in service revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in as a percentage of total revenues  service revenues were  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in service revenues was due primarily to increased revenues from maintenance and support contracts as marimba s customer base has grown 
also  we increased our consulting revenues as customers elected to utilize our consulting organization to assist them with their implementation of our products 
costs of revenues cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues consists primarily of the cost of third party software products that were either integrated into our products or resold by us 
cost of license revenues was   and  in  and  respectively 
the higher cost of license revenues in was due primarily to the costs of a third party product resold by us 
we expect cost of license revenues to remain a relatively small percentage of total revenues 
cost of service revenues 
cost of service revenues includes 
salaries and related expenses of our customer service and training organizations  
salaries and related expenses of our consultants for billable consulting engagements  
cost of third parties contracted to provide consulting services to our customers  and 
an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses 
cost of service revenues was million  million and million in  and  representing  and of service revenue  respectively 
the year to year increases in absolute dollars of cost of service revenues were due primarily to growth in our customer service and training organizations  higher fees paid to a third party that provides after hours telephone support for our customers and an increase in the costs of providing our consulting services  commensurate with the increase in consulting revenues 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses  which are expensed as incurred  consist primarily of 
salaries and related costs of our engineering organization  
fees paid to third party consultants  if any  and 
an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses 
we believe that our success is dependent in large part on continued enhancement of our current products and the ability to develop new  technologically advanced products that meet the sophisticated requirements of our customers 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenses from to was due primarily to our decision to focus on marimba s core change and configuration management products and the resulting discontinuance of marimba 
net  a distribution hosting service and closure of our houston  texas development facility that had previously been dedicated to performance management product development 
the increase in research and development expenses from to was due primarily to an increase in engineering personnel and related costs 
over the long term  we plan to increase our investment in research and development 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of 
salaries and related costs of our sales and marketing organizations  
sales commissions  
costs of our marketing programs  including public relations  advertising  trade shows  collateral sales materials  and seminars  
rent and facilities costs associated with our regional and international sales offices  and 
an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
from to  sales and marketing expenses increased due primarily to growth in the sales organization during the first half of  expansion of marimba s sales operation in the united kingdom and telemarketing expenses 
from to  the increase in sales and marketing expenses was due primarily to growth in our sales and marketing organizations  an increase in sales commissions as sales increased  an increase in the number of regional sales offices and expansion of our marketing programs 
over the long term  we expect to continue to invest heavily in sales and marketing in order to grow revenues and expand our brand awareness 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of 
costs of our finance  human resources and legal services organizations  
insurance premiums and third party legal and other professional services fees  and 
an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses were higher in compared with and due primarily to the settlement of our patent disputes with novadigm  inc  and an increase in the bad debt provision of approximately million 
both of these events occurred in additionally  from through we have grown our administrative organizations in support of the overall company growth 
restructuring 
in april  marimba announced a restructuring plan 
the plan involved the elimination of approximately of the workforce  or employees and independent contractors 
marimba recorded a charge of  in the second quarter of related to the restructuring plan  which consisted of personnel costs of  facilities and equipment impairments of  and other costs of  deferred compensation 
we recorded deferred compensation of approximately million in  representing the difference between the exercise prices of options granted to acquire  shares of common stock during and the deemed fair value for financial reporting purposes of our common stock on the grant dates 
in addition  we granted options to purchase common stock in april for which we recorded additional deferred compensation of approximately million 
in  we recorded deferred compensation of approximately million net of reduction of  due to cancelled shares  which represented the intrinsic value of certain stock awards 
in  we recorded deferred compensation of approximately million net of reduction of  due to cancelled shares  which represented the intrinsic value of certain stock awards 
deferred compensation is being amortized over the vesting periods of the options and stock on a graded vesting method 
we amortized deferred compensation expense of million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
this compensation expense relates to options awarded to individuals in all operating expense categories 
the amortization of deferred compensation  assuming no further reductions due to cancelled shares  is expected to approximate million in and  in in july  marimba granted an option to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share to a non employee in exchange for consulting services 
the option was fully vested at the date of grant and is exercisable for ten years 
we estimated the fair value of the option granted for services using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions risk free interest rate of  an expected life of years  dividend yield of zero and volatility of 
in connection with this option to purchase common stock  marimba recorded a non cash charge to sales and marketing expense of  in interest income and other expenses  net interest income  net  consists primarily of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments offset by other miscellaneous expenses 
interest income  net was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income  net  from to was due primarily to lower invested cash balances and lower interest rates 
the increase in interest income  net  from to was due primarily to increased invested cash balances from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering in april provision for income taxes marimba s provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and  consists of state income and franchise taxes and foreign taxes 
for the year ended december  our provision for income taxes is comprised entirely of foreign taxes 
no provision for federal taxes has been recorded  because we have experienced operating losses from inception through as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
we also had a federal research and development tax credit carryforward of approximately million at that date 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations contained in the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating loss and credits before utilization 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and and million of short term and long term investments in marketable securities  respectively 
in april  we sold shares of our common stock in our initial public offering  generating net proceeds of approximately million after offering expenses 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  reflects the investment of approximately million of the net proceeds from our initial public offering in marketable securities 
proceeds from other issuances of common stock of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  are comprised primarily of employee exercises of stock options 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  is the result of the net loss for the year and a decrease in deferred revenue  partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and adjustments for non cash depreciation and amortization 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  is primarily the result of the net loss for the year and an increase in accounts receivable  partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue 
marimba s contractual obligations consist of noncancellable operating lease agreements 
as of december   future minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases for the period through are expected to be approximately million  as presented in the table below operating leases in thousands year ending december total minimum lease payments  we currently anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
thereafter  cash generated from operations  if any  may not be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements 
we may therefore need to sell additional equity or raise funds by other means 
any additional financings  if needed  might not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
failure to raise capital when needed could seriously harm our business and operating results 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of ownership of our stockholders would be reduced 
furthermore  these equity securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock 
related party transactions in july  marimba provided a loan facility of up to  to one of its executive officers to assist him in paying withholding taxes incurred upon the purchase of restricted stock 
the note bore interest at the rate of  had an outstanding principal amount of  and became due and payable in full on october   which was three months from the executive officer s employment termination date with marimba on july  no amounts were drawn in the outstanding principal amount due under the note was repaid by the executive officer on october  in september  marimba executed a software license agreement in the amount of  with a customer  whose chief executive officer is a member of marimba s board of directors 
as of december   there were no amounts due 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue no 
eitf  accounting for certain sales incentives  effective for periods beginning after december  eitf addresses the recognition  measurement  and income statement classification for sales incentives that a vendor voluntarily offers to customers without charge  which the customer can use in  or exercise as a result of  a single exchange transaction 
sales incentives that fall within the scope of eitf include offers that a customer can use to receive a reduction in the price of a product or service at the point of sale 
we expect to adopt eitf during the first quarter of fiscal  and we do not believe that it will have a material effect on our operating results or financial position 
in june  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
eitf  vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products  effective for periods beginning after december  eitf addresses whether consideration from a vendor to a reseller is a an adjustment of the selling prices of the vendor s products and  therefore  should be deducted from revenue when recognized in the vendor s statement of operations or b a cost incurred by the vendor for assets or services received from the reseller and  therefore  should be included as a cost or expense when recognized in the vendor s statement of operations 
upon application of eitf  financial statements for prior periods presented for comparative purposes should be reclassified to comply with the income statement display requirements 
we expect to adopt eitf during the first quarter of fiscal  and we do not believe that it will have a material effect on our operating results or financial position 
in september  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
eitf  accounting for consideration given by vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products  which is a codification of eitf  eitf and eitf  accounting for points and certain other time or volume based sales incentive offers and offers for free products or services to be delivered in the future 
marimba is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of these issues on our financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations fas 
fas establishes new standards for accounting and reporting business combinations and requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  use of the pooling of interests method will be prohibited 
we expect to adopt this statement during the first quarter of fiscal  and we do not believe that fas will have a material effect on our operating results or financial positions 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  intangible assets 
fas establishes new standards for goodwill  including the elimination of goodwill amortization to be replaced with methods of periodically evaluating goodwill for impairment 
we expect to adopt this statement during the first quarter of fiscal  and we do not believe that sfas will have a material effect on our operating results or financial position 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  reporting the results of operations for a disposal of a segment of a business 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier application encouraged 
we plan to adopt fas as of january  and expect that the adoption of the statement will have an insignificant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued a staff announcement  topic d  which concluded that the reimbursement of out of pocket expenses should be classified as revenue in the statement of operations for financial reporting periods beginning after december  and comparative financial statements for prior periods should be reclassified to comply with the guidance in this announcement 
marimba currently records reimbursement of out of pocket expenses in cost of services 
effective january   we will apply this announcement 
the announcement will have no impact on gross profit or net loss  but will increase services revenue and cost of services revenue 
other factors affecting operating results  liquidity and capital resources the factors discussed below are cautionary statements that identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
for more information regarding the forward looking statements contained in this report  see the introductory paragraph to part i on page above 
our limited operating history may prevent us from achieving success in our business we were founded in february and have a limited operating history that may prevent us from achieving success in our business 
the revenues and income potential of our business and market are unproven 
we will encounter challenges and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
we may not successfully address any of these challenges and the failure to do so would seriously harm our business and operating results 
in addition  because of our limited operating history  we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business 
we have incurred losses and may incur future losses our failure to significantly increase our revenues would seriously harm our business and operating results 
there is no assurance that we will reach sustained profitability 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect over the long term to increase our research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
as a result  we will need to increase our quarterly revenues to offset these increasing expenses and return to profitability 
we may not be able to sustain our historical revenue levels 
in fact  we may not have any revenue growth  and our revenues could decline 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results and absence of significant backlog our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and will likely vary significantly in the future 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of our future performance 
in the future  our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
our failure to meet these expectations would likely harm the market price of our common stock 
operating results vary depending on a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
our operating results may also depend on general economic factors  including an economic slowdown or recession 
a substantial portion of our revenues for most quarters has been booked in the last month of the quarter and the m agnitude of quarterly fluctuations in operating results may not become evident until late in or even at the end of a particular quarter 
as a result  a delay in recognizing revenue  even from just one account  could have a significant negative impact on our operating results 
in the past  a significant portion of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter 
a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter could negatively impact our operating results 
we generally expect that revenues in the first quarter of each year will not substantially increase over  and may be lower than  revenues in the fourth quarter of the preceding year due to the annual nature of companies purchasing and budgeting cycles and the year to date structure of our sales incentive program 
our expense levels are relatively fixed for a particular quarter and are based  in part  on expectations as to future revenues 
as a result  if revenue levels fall below our expectations for a particular quarter  our operating results will be adversely affected because only a small portion of our expenses vary with our revenues 
we have historically operated with little product backlog  because our products are generally delivered as orders are received 
as a result  revenue in any quarter will depend on the volume and timing  and the ability to fill  orders received in that quarter 
we expect significant increases in our operating expenses despite recent cost cutting measures implemented by marimba  we intend over the long term to substantially increase our operating expenses as we 
increase our sales and marketing activities  including expanding our direct sales force  
increase our research and development activities  
expand our customer support and professional services organizations  and 
expand our distribution channels 
with these additional expenses  we must significantly increase our revenues in order to achieve and sustain profitability 
these expenses will be incurred before we generate any revenues associated with this increased spending 
if we do not significantly increase revenues from these efforts  our business and operating results would be adversely affected 
our success depends on our desktop mobile management product family we expect to continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our desktop mobile management product line and related services 
a decline in the price of our desktop mobile management products or our inability to increase sales of these products would seriously harm our business and operating results 
we cannot predict the success of desktop mobile management products 
we periodically update our desktop mobile management products to make improvements and provide additional enhancements 
new versions of this product line may not provide the benefits we expect and could fail to meet customers requirements or achieve widespread market acceptance 
our strategy requires our desktop mobile management products to be highly scalable in other words  able to rapidly increase deployment size from a limited number of end users to a very large number of end users 
if we are unable to achieve this level of scalability  the attractiveness of our products and services would be diminished 
we need to grow our server management and embedded management product revenues and develop new products and services during  revenues from our server management and embedded management product lines accounted for and of total license revenues  respectively 
there can be no assurance that the revenues from each of these product lines will grow  in absolute amount or as a percentage of total license revenues  or that our server management products and embedded management products will meet customer expectations or gain widespread market acceptance 
to provide comprehensive systems management solutions  we will need to develop and introduce new products and services which offer functionality that we do not currently provide 
we may not be able to develop these technologies  and therefore  we may not be able to offer a comprehensive systems management solution 
in addition  in the past we have experienced delays in new product releases  and we may experience similar delays in the future 
if we fail to release new product on a timely basis  our business and operating results could be seriously harmed 
we depend on the growth of our customer base and increased business from our current customers our success is substantially dependent on the continued growth of our customer base 
if we fail to increase our customer base  our business and operating results would be seriously harmed 
our ability to attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors  including the reliability  security  scalability and cost effectiveness of our products and services  as well as our ability to effectively market our products and services 
if we fail to generate repeat and expanded business from our current customers  our business and operating results would be seriously harmed 
many of our customers initially make a limited purchase of our products and services for pilot programs 
these customers may not choose to purchase additional licenses to expand their use of our products 
in addition  as we deploy new versions of our products or introduce new products  our current customers may not require the functionality provided by our new products and may not ultimately license these products 
because the total amount of maintenance and support fees we receive in any period depends in large part on the size and number of licenses that we have previously sold  any downturn in our software license revenues would negatively impact our future service revenues 
our support and maintenance programs are sold on an annual basis 
renewal of annual support and maintenance is generally at the customer s election 
if customers elect not to renew their support and maintenance agreements  our services revenues could be significantly adversely impacted 
if support and maintenance revenues were to decline  or not grow as rapidly as expected  marimba would need to increase its license revenues and other service revenues in order to make up for the decline in support and maintenance revenues 
implementation of our products by large customers may be complex and customers could become dissatisfied if implementation of our products proves difficult  costly or time consuming our products must integrate with many existing computer systems and software programs used by our customers 
integrating with many other computer systems and software programs can be complex  time consuming and expensive and can cause delays in the deployment of our products for such customers 
customers could become dissatisfied with our products if implementations prove to be difficult  costly or time consuming  and this could negatively impact our ability to sell our products 
we must retain and attract key personnel our success depends largely on the skills  experience and performance of the members of our senior management and other key personnel  including our president and chief executive officer  richard wyckoff  our chief financial officer  mark garrett  and our vice president of worldwide sales  matt thompson 
we have in the past lost senior management personnel 
several members of our senior management are relatively new to marimba  including messrs 
wyckoff  garrett and thompson  and our success will depend in part on the successful assimilation and performance of these individuals 
we may not be successful in attracting qualified senior management personnel or be able to attract  assimilate and retain other key personnel in the future 
none of our senior management or other key personnel is bound by an employment agreement 
if we lose additional key employees and are unable to replace them with qualified individuals  our business and operating results could be seriously harmed 
in addition  our future success will depend largely on our ability to continue attracting and retaining highly skilled personnel 
like other companies based primarily in the software industry  we face intense competition for qualified personnel 
we have a long sales cycle that depends upon factors outside our control a customer s decision to license our products typically involves a significant commitment of resources and is influenced by the customer s budget cycles 
in addition  selling our products requires us to educate potential customers on our product s use and benefits 
as a result  our products have a long sales cycle which can take over six months 
we face difficulty predicting the quarter in which sales to expected customers may occur 
the sale of our products is also subject to delays from the lengthy budgeting  approval and competitive evaluation processes of our customers that typically accompany significant capital expenditures 
for example  customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to test our products before they decide whether to purchase a license for deployment 
customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by us or our competitors 
we are exposed to general economic conditions and reductions in corporate it spending  and the current economic downturn may continue to adversely impact our business our business is subject to the effects of general economic conditions and  in particular  market conditions in the industries that we serve 
we believe that our operating results are being adversely impacted by recent unfavorable general economic conditions and reductions in corporate it spending 
finally  since many of our customers may be suffering adverse effects of the general economic slowdown  we may find that collecting accounts receivable from existing or new customers will take longer than we expect or that some accounts receivable will become uncollectable 
if these economic conditions do not improve  or if we experience a worsening in general economic conditions or corporate it spending  our business and operating results could continue to be adversely impacted 
our markets are highly competitive our markets are highly competitive  and we expect this competition to persist and intensify in the future 
our failure to maintain and enhance our competitive position could seriously harm our business and operating results 
we encounter competition from a number of sources  including 
sellers of enterprise wide management systems  which include electronic software distribution  
companies that market products that support the distribution of software applications and content  and 
desktop software management products 
in addition  we compete with various methods of software distribution including thin client systems and web browsers and with application server vendors and others that have introduced software distribution capabilities into their products 
potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate additional components into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products 
furthermore  new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than we can 
most of our competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
many of these companies have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships that they could leverage  including relationships with many of our current and potential customers 
these companies also have significantly more established customer support and professional service organizations than we do 
in addition  these companies may adopt aggressive pricing policies which we are unable to match 
in the past  we have lost potential customers to competitors for various reasons  including lower prices 
protection of our intellectual property is limited we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
these legal protections afford only limited protection 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use our proprietary information 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could significantly harm our business and operating results 
in addition  we sell our products internationally  and the laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights as well as the laws of the united states 
we are involved in patent infringement litigation and may be found to infringe proprietary rights of others we are a defendant in the patent infringement litigation described in part ii  item legal proceedings of this report 
we intend to defend this litigation vigorously 
however  due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of the litigation  particularly in cases such as this where sophisticated factual issues must be assessed and complex technical issues must be decided 
our defense of this litigation  regardless of the merits of the complaint  has been  and will likely continue to be  time consuming  costly and a diversion for marimba s technical and management personnel 
any unfavorable outcome of this litigation could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
other companies  including our competitors  may obtain patents or other proprietary rights that could prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use or sell our products 
as a result  we may be found to infringe the proprietary rights of others 
furthermore  companies in the software market are increasingly bringing suits alleging infringement of their proprietary rights  particularly patent rights 
we could incur substantial costs to defend any intellectual property litigation including the one described above  and intellectual property litigation could result in one or more of the following 
our paying monetary damages  which could be tripled if the infringement is found to have been willful  
the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction requiring us to stop selling one or more of our products in their current forms  
our having to redesign one or more of our products  which could be costly and time consuming and could substantially delay shipments  assuming that a redesign is feasible  
our having to reimburse the holder of the infringed intellectual property for some or all of its attorneys fees and costs  
our having to obtain from the holder licenses to its intellectual property  which licenses might not be made available to us on reasonable terms  or 
our having to indemnify our customers against any losses they may incur due to the alleged infringement 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology  our business and operating results would be significantly harmed 
we are involved in a securities class action litigation and are at risk of additional similar litigation in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
we are a party to the securities class action litigation described in part ii  item legal proceedings of this report 
the defense of this litigation may increase our expenses and divert our management s attention and resources  and an adverse outcome in this litigation could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  we may in the future be the target of other securities class action or similar litigation 
we need to develop third party distribution relationships we have a limited number of distribution relationships and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships 
our current agreements with our distribution partners do not prevent these companies from selling products of other companies  including products that may compete with our products  and do not generally require these companies to purchase minimum quantities of our products 
these distributors could give higher priority to the products of other companies or to their own products  than they give to our products 
in addition  sales through these channels generally result in lower fees to marimba than direct sales 
as a result  while the loss of  or significant reduction in  sales volume to any of our current or future distribution partners could seriously harm our revenues and operating results  a significant increase in sales through these channels could also negatively impact our gross margins 
we need to develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities we need to expand our direct sales and marketing operations in order to increase market awareness of our products  market our products to a greater number of enterprises and generate increased revenues 
competition for qualified sales personnel is intense and we may not be able to hire enough qualified sales personnel in the future 
our products and services require a sophisticated sales effort targeted at senior management of our prospective customers 
new hires require extensive training and typically take at least six months to achieve full productivity 
there is no assurance that new sales representatives will ultimately become productive 
in prior quarters  marimba s license revenues have often resulted from contracts closed by just a few sales representatives 
if marimba were to lose qualified and productive sales personnel  our revenues would be adversely impacted 
furthermore  the cost of hiring and training replacement sales personnel could be significant 
in addition  we have limited experience marketing our products broadly to a large number of potential customers  both in the united states and elsewhere 
we need to expand our professional services we may not be able to attract  train or retain the number of highly qualified services personnel that our business needs 
we believe that growth in our product sales depends on our ability to provide our customers with professional services and to educate third party resellers and consultants on how to provide similar services 
over the long term  we plan to increase the number of our services personnel to meet these needs 
however  competition for qualified services personnel is intense 
over the long term  we expect our total service revenues to increase as we continue to provide support  consulting and training services that complement our products and as our installed customer base grows 
this could negatively impact our gross margin because margins on revenues derived from services are generally lower than gross margins on revenues derived from the license of our products 
expanding internationally is expensive  we may receive no benefit from our expansion and our international operations are subject to governmental regulation we plan to increase our international sales force and operations  and expanding internationally is expensive 
however  we may not be successful in increasing our international sales force or sales revenue 
in addition  our international business activities are subject to a variety of risks  including the adoption of or changes in laws  currency fluctuations  actions by third parties and political and economic conditions that could restrict or eliminate our ability to do business in foreign jurisdictions 
to date  we have not adopted a hedging program to protect us from risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
export clearances  and in some cases  import clearances must be obtained before our products can be distributed internationally 
current or new government laws and regulations  or the application of existing laws and regulations  could expose us to significant liabilities  significantly slow our growth and seriously harm our business and operating results 
we must manage our growth and expansion our historical growth has placed  and any further growth is likely to continue to place  a significant strain on our resources 
any failure to manage growth effectively could seriously harm our business and operating results 
to be successful  we will need to implement additional management information systems  improve our operating  administrative  financial and accounting systems and controls  train new employees and maintain close coordination among our executive  engineering  finance  legal  marketing  sales and operations organizations 
in addition  our growth has resulted  and any future growth will result  in increased responsibilities for management personnel 
we rely on third party software and applications we integrate third party software and digital certificates as a component of our software 
there are inherent limitations in the use and capabilities of much of the technology that we license from third parties 
as a result  we face a number of challenges in integrating these technologies into our products 
we would be seriously harmed if the providers from whom we license software ceased to deliver and support reliable products  enhance their current products or respond to emerging industry standards 
in addition  the third party software may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the loss of  or inability to maintain or obtain this software  could result in shipment delays or reductions 
furthermore  we might be forced to limit the features available in our current or future product offerings 
either alternative could seriously harm our business and operating results 
almost all of our products are written in java and require a java virtual machine in order to operate 
vendors offering these java virtual machines may not continue to make these implementations of the java virtual machines available at commercially reasonable terms or at all 
furthermore  if sun microsystems  inc were to make significant changes to the java language  if significant changes were to be made to java virtual machine implementations of sun microsystems  inc and other vendors or if they fail to correct defects and limitations in these products  our ability to continue to improve and ship our products could be impaired 
in the future  our customers may also require the ability to deploy our products on platforms for which technically acceptable java implementations either do not exist or are not available on commercially reasonable terms 
our customers may also use particular implementations of the java virtual machines that may not be technically or commercially acceptable for integration into our products 
software defects in our products would harm our business complex software products like ours often contain errors or defects  including errors relating to security  particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
our products extensively utilize digital certificates and other complex technology 
our use of this technology has in the past and may in the future result in product behavior problems which may not be anticipated by us or our customers 
defects or errors in current or future products could result in lost revenues or a delay in market acceptance  which would seriously harm our business and operating results 
since many of our customers use our products for business critical applications  errors  defects or other performance problems could result in financial or other damage to our customers and could significantly impair their operations 
our customers could seek damages for losses related to any of these issues 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if not successful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend and could adversely affect our marketing efforts 
our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products or new contracts by us or our competitors  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights and related litigation  other material litigation involving marimba  changes in our management or other key employees  adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry  general market conditions and other factors 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for the common stock of technology companies 
these types of broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our future capital needs are uncertain we expect that our current cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least twelve months 
after that  we may need to raise additional funds  and additional financing may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
this could seriously harm our business and operating results 
furthermore  if we issue additional equity securities  stockholders may experience dilution  and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of existing holders of our common stock 
if we cannot raise funds  if needed  on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
we have experienced recent credit related issues with certain of our customers and we may not achieve anticipated revenue if we need to defer a significant amount of revenue we have experienced recent credit related issues with certain of our existing and proposed customers  primarily due to the economic slowdown in the united states 
certain of these customers are in the process of obtaining funding  and in certain cases  we have deferred a portion or all of the revenues from these customers until they have achieved adequate levels of financing and are able to pay us 
should we have more customers than we anticipate with liquidity issues  or if payment is not received on a timely basis  our business  operating results and general financial condition could be seriously harmed 
we face challenges stemming from our emerging markets the market for certain of our products has only recently begun to develop  is rapidly evolving and will likely have an increasing number of competitors 
we cannot be certain that a viable market for these products will emerge or be sustainable 
if this market fails to develop  or develops more slowly than expected  our business and operating results would be seriously harmed 
furthermore  in order to be successful in this emerging market  we must be able to differentiate marimba from our competitors through our product and service offerings and brand name recognition 
we may not be successful in differentiating marimba or achieving widespread market acceptance of our products and services 
in addition  enterprises that have already invested substantial resources in other methods of deploying and managing their applications  content and or services may be reluctant or slow to adopt a new approach that may replace  limit or compete with their existing systems 
we must respond to rapid technological change and evolving industry standards the markets for our systems management solutions are characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
new solutions based on new technologies or new industry standards can quickly render existing solutions obsolete and unmarketable 
any delays in our ability to develop and release enhanced or new solutions could seriously harm our business and operating results 
our technology is complex  and new products  enhancements and services can require long development and testing periods 
our failure to conform to prevailing standards could have a negative effect on our business and operating results 
we face risks associated with potential acquisitions we may make acquisitions in the future 
acquisitions of companies  products or technologies entail numerous risks  including an inability to successfully assimilate acquired operations and products  diversion of management s attention  loss of key employees of acquired companies and substantial transaction costs 
some of the products acquired may require significant additional development before they can be marketed and may not generate revenue at anticipated levels 
moreover  future acquisitions by us may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  large one time write offs and the creation of goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant amortization expense 
any of these problems or factors could seriously harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since most of our investments are in marketable securities with maturities less than two years 
our investment policy requires us to invest funds in excess of current operating requirements in 
obligations of the us government and its agencies  
investment grade state and local government obligations  
securities of us corporations rated a or aa by standard and poors or the moody s equivalent  and 
money market funds  deposits or notes issued or guaranteed by us and non us commercial banks meeting particular credit rating and net worth requirements with maturities of less than two years 
the following table presents the amounts of cash equivalents and investments that are subject to market risk and the weighted average interest rates  by year of expected maturity  for our investment portfolio as of december  and this table does not include money market funds  because those funds are not subject to market risk 
maturing during in thousands december  cash equivalents  weighted average interest rate investments   weighted average interest rate total   weighted average interest rate maturing during in thousands december  cash equivalents  weighted average interest rate investments   weighted average interest rate total   weighted average interest rate exchange rate sensitivity we develop products in the united states  and sell our products and services primarily in north america  europe and asia 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by various factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as sales are generally made in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
to date  however  because we operate primarily in the united states and as sales have been generally made in us dollars  we have had no material exposures to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
accordingly  we have no basis to quantify the risk from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates
