item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on applying our comprehensive and integrated science and technology platform to discover and accelerate the development of breakthrough drugs and predictive medicine products 
we expect that these drugs and products ultimately will enable physicians to more closely customize medical treatment by combining knowledge of the genetic basis for disease and the genetic characteristics of a patient 
we primarily focus our research and development and commercialization activities in four key disease areas cardiovascular  oncology  inflammatory and metabolic 
we view the pursuit of mergers  acquisitions and product in licensing as important in achieving our business goals 
our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations are subject to important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated 
see risk factors that may affect results 
alliances we have entered into research  development  technology transfer and commercialization arrangements with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies relating to a broad range of therapeutic and predictive medicine products and services 
these alliances provide us with the opportunity to receive various combinations of equity investments  license fees and research funding  and may provide certain additional payments contingent upon our achievement of research and regulatory milestones and royalties and or share profits if our collaborations are successful in developing and commercializing products 
the alliances which we consider material to our business are a collaboration agreement with schering plough ltd 
and schering corporation to jointly develop and commercialize integrilin eptifibatide injection on a worldwide basis  an agreement with genentech to co promote integrilin with genentech s fibrinolytic  or clot dissolving drugs  tnkase tenecteplase and activase alteplase across the united states  an in license and development agreement with xenova group  plc for novel compounds for the treatment of solid tumors in cancer  a collaboration agreement with xoma ltd  pursuant to which xoma will develop two biotherapeutic agents  a joint development agreement with bzl biologics  llc for immunotoxin and radiolabeled products  a joint development and commercialization agreement with abbott laboratories in metabolic diseases  a technology transfer agreement and joint development and commercialization agreement with aventis pharmaceuticals  inc in inflammatory disease  a research agreement with bayer  ag in cardiovascular disease  and certain areas of oncology  pain  hematology  atherosclerosis  thrombosis  urology and viral infections  and a research alliance and technology transfer agreement with monsanto company in plant agriculture 
historically  we have primarily derived our revenue from payments from our strategic alliances with major pharmaceutical companies 
we have not received any revenue from the sale of products 
beginning in the first quarter of  we will recognize co promotion revenue which will include our share of the profits from the sale of integrilin eptifibatide injection  in co promotion territories by schering plough ltd 
and schering corporation  as well as the reimbursement from schering of a portion of our costs of co promotion revenue 
additionally  revenues will include recognition of reimbursement to us by schering of certain manufacturing related expenses for materials outside the co promotion territory and royalties from schering on sales of integrilin outside the co promotion territory 
acquisitions as part of our business strategy  we continually consider joint development  merger and acquisition opportunities that may provide us with products on the market  products in later stage development or additional capabilities necessary to accelerate our downstream drug discovery efforts 
cor on february   we acquired cor through the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock 
this calculation is based on cor s outstanding common stock at the time of the merger using the conversion ratio of 
of a share of our common stock for each share of outstanding cor common stock 
in addition  options to purchase approximately million shares of cor common stock were assumed by us and converted into options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock 
in the first quarter of  we will record the transaction as a purchase for accounting purposes and allocate the purchase price  based upon an independent valuation  to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values 
we will allocate the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair market value of net tangible assets acquired to in process research and development  developed technology and trademark and goodwill 
based upon a preliminary review  we estimate the charge to earnings for acquired in process research and development to be approximately million 
the amount of acquired in process research and development will be determined upon completion of an independent appraisal and  therefore  may differ from our current estimate 
cor s results of operations will be included in our results beginning on the date of the acquisition 
through the merger  we added approximately new employees  a facility in south san francisco  california  acquired integrilin for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes and substantial research capabilities in the areas of cardiovascular disease and oncology 
in connection with the cor acquisition  we assumed cor s million in convertible debt resulting from two offerings the convertible subordinated notes due march  and the convertible senior notes due june  as a result  the noteholders have an option to convert to our common stock 
within thirty days following the closing of the merger  we are obligated to offer cash for the notes at face value through a tender offer 
in the event that the holders of large numbers of these notes accept the offer  the amount of our cash and cash equivalents would be substantially diminished 
cdc on july   we acquired cambridge discovery chemistry ltd  a subsidiary of oxford molecular group  plc  for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
we recorded the transaction as a purchase for accounting purposes and accordingly  we allocated the purchase price to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values 
we allocated the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair market value of tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to intangible assets  resulting in million of specifically identified intangible assets and million of goodwill 
the acquisition did not result in an in process research and development charge 
leukosite on december   we acquired leukosite for an aggregate purchase price of million  effected through the issuance of million shares of our common stock and million shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of assumed leukosite options and warrants 
we recorded the transaction as a purchase for accounting purposes 
we allocated the purchase price  based upon an independent valuation  to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values  with the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair market value of net tangible assets allocated to in process research and development  assembled workforce  core technology and goodwill 
the acquired in process research and development of million was immediately charged to earnings 
through our acquisition of leukosite  we became a party to a joint venture partnership  millennium and ilex partners  lp m i  for development of campath 
under the terms of the partnership  we were required to fund fifty percent of m i s working capital requirements 
we accounted for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting 
on december   ilex oncology  inc ilex acquired our equity interest in m i  which owns the campath product 
in exchange for our equity interest in m i  ilex paid us million on december  and is obligated to pay us up to an additional million over the next three years if sales of campath in the us meet specified sales thresholds 
in addition  we will be entitled to additional payments from ilex based on us sales of campath after financings in order to fund our working capital and other corporate purposes  we have completed several financings in the past three years 
the actual and planned uses of proceeds include financing our growth  accelerating the expansion of our technology platform  developing products  including conducting preclinical and clinical testing and clinical trials  acquisitions of businesses  products  and technologies that expand or complement our business 
in october  we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
in january  we completed a sale  pursuant to rule a of the securities act of  of million of convertible subordinated notes due january   which resulted in net proceeds to us of million 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to maturity at a price equal to per share  subject to adjustment  unless previously repurchased or redeemed by us 
under the terms of the notes  we are required to make semi annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of the notes on january and july of each year 
to date  all required interest payments have been made 
during and  we paid an aggregate of million and million in cash  respectively  to certain holders of our convertible subordinated notes due january  in order to induce the conversion of their notes into our common stock 
these cash payments were expensed during and interest accrued through the date of conversion was charged to interest expense and was paid upon conversion 
these conversions resulted in the retirement of million and million in and  respectively  of outstanding principal of these notes  the issuance of approximately million and million shares in and  respectively  of our common stock  and the reclassification of deferred debt issuance costs of million and million in and  respectively  to additional paid in capital 
at december   we had million of these notes outstanding 
during  we received million from abbott and million from aventis for purchases of approximately million shares and approximately million shares  respectively  of our common stock under equity investment agreements 
expansion of operations during  we continued to expand our operations through internal growth  additional strategic alliances and the cor acquisition  which closed in february to build downstream capabilities  in we hired staff in critical functions  including global commercial operations  clinical research and operations  strategic product development  government relations and regulatory affairs  as well as in other support areas 
as a result of the cor acquisition  we will incur additional significant expenses for research and development and to develop  train  maintain and manage our sales force for integrilin eptifibatide injection 
for the cor notes that remain outstanding after the tender offer  we will be required to make semi annual interest payments each year on the outstanding principal balance 
we expect to continue to pursue additional alliances and to consider joint development  merger  or acquisition opportunities that may provide us with access to products on the market or in later stages of commercial development than those represented within our current programs 
we expect that we will incur increasing expenses and may incur increasing operating losses for at least the next several years  primarily due to expansion of facilities and research and development programs and as a result of our efforts to advance acquired products or our own development programs to commercialization 
our results of operations for any period may not be indicative of future results as our revenues under strategic alliance and licensing arrangements  co promotion revenue and from product sales may fluctuate from period to period or year to year 
critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we believe the following accounting policy to be critical revenue we have formed strategic alliances with major pharmaceutical companies 
these agreements include alliances based on the transfer of technology  alliances which combine technology transfer with a focus on a specific disease or therapeutic approach  and disease focused programs under which we conduct research funded by our partners 
several of our disease based alliances and alliances which combine technology transfer with a disease focus are generally structured as research collaborations 
under these arrangements  we perform research in a specific disease area aimed at discoveries leading to novel pharmaceutical small molecule products 
these alliances generally provide research funding over an initial period  with renewal provisions  varying by agreement 
under these agreements  our partners may make up front payments  additional payments upon the achievement of specific research and product development milestones  ongoing research funding and or pay royalties or in some cases make profit sharing payments to us based upon any product sales resulting from the collaboration 
effective october   we changed our method of accounting for revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
previously  we had recognized revenue relating to non refundable  up front  license and milestone payments and certain research funding payments from our strategic partners in accordance with the contract 
under the new accounting method adopted retroactively to january   we recognize revenue from non refundable  up front  license and milestone payments  not specifically tied to a separate earnings process  ratably over the term of the research contract 
when the period of deferral cannot be specifically identified from the contract  management estimates the period based upon other critical factors contained within the contract 
we continually review these estimates which could result in a change in the deferral period 
when payments are specifically tied to a separate earnings process  revenue is recognized when the specific performance obligation associated with the payment is completed 
performance obligations typically consist of significant milestones in the development life cycle of the related technology  such as initiation of clinical trials  filing for approval with regulatory agencies and approvals by regulatory agencies 
in addition  when appropriate  we recognize revenue from certain research payments based upon the level of research services performed during the period of the research contract 
the cumulative effect of the change on prior years resulted in a charge to income of million  which is included in the loss for the year ended december  in connection with our adoption of sab  we began recognizing the research funding portion of our bayer alliance on a percentage of completion basis 
the percentage of completion is determined based upon the actual level of work performed during the period as compared to management s estimate of the total work to be performed under the alliance 
the estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as necessary  as experience develops or new information becomes known 
accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the effective date of this statement was deferred to fiscal years beginning after june  by sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of effective date of sfas no 
sfas no 
was amended by sfas no 
accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
we adopted this new accounting standard effective january  and it did not have a significant effect on the financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations except for qualifying business combinations that were initiated prior to july  under sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   we are required to adopt sfas no 
for the fiscal year beginning after december  we adopted sfas no 
effective january  and reclassified amounts to goodwill which were previously allocated to assembled workforce 
upon adoption  we ceased the amortization of goodwill currently representing expense of million per year 
although we have not completed the transitional impairment test  we do not currently expect a material impairment charge upon adoption 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
for the fiscal year beginning after december  we adopted sfas no 
effective january  and it did not have a significant effect on the financial statements 
results of operations years ended december  and december  the discussion below relating to the net loss attributable to common stockholders and revenue for the year ended december  the period reflect pro forma results as if we had followed sab from our inception 
for the year ended december  the period  we had a net loss of million or per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million or per basic and diluted share for the period 
revenue under strategic alliances increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the increase is primarily attributable to increased revenue from bayer  aventis and taisho 
the increase in bayer revenue relates primarily to increased milestone and research revenue during the period 
the increase in aventis revenue is due to the fact that the alliance was in place for a full year during the period versus a partial year in the period 
taisho revenue increased as the research program expanded 
included in and revenue is million and million  respectively  of revenue that was recognized in prior years relating to the adoption of sab the amount of revenue to be recognized in future years that was included in the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle is million  million and 
million for  and  respectively 
under the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition  we are required to periodically review and update our estimates as experience develops and as new information becomes known 
to reflect research productivity improvements  management revised its estimate of the remaining work to be performed under the bayer alliance  which resulted in a cumulative catch up adjustment of million of additional revenue in september excluding the impact of this change in estimate  net loss attributable to common stockholders and the related earnings per share amounts for the year ended december  would have been million and per share 
research and development expenses increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the increase was primarily attributable to our continued investment in building a sustainable product pipeline  with increases in personnel and facilities  expenses relating to clinical trials and preclinical product candidates  technology license payments and purchases of laboratory supplies 
as of december   we had ten product candidates in various stages of clinical trials 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time can vary substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
in  we initiated a phase ii trial of our lead oncology candidate  mln  in patients with hematologic cancers and phase i trials for potential treatment of patients with solid tumors 
also in  we initiated phase ii trials of mln in patients with ulcerative colitis and of mln in patients with asthma 
the radio labeled version of our anti psma prostate specific membrane antigen antibody  mln is in phase i trial in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer 
in november  we initiated a phase i trial of our first genomically derived molecule  mln  for the potential treatment of obesity 
cmr international estimates that clinical trials in our franchise areas are typically completed over the following timelines clinical phase estimated completion period phase i years phase ii years phase iii years upon successful completion of phase iii trials  we intend to submit the results to the fda to support regulatory approval of the product 
however  we cannot be certain that any of our products will prove to be safe or effective  will receive regulatory approvals  or will be successfully commercialized 
the duration and the cost relating to preclinical testing and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project 
our joint development arrangements with our strategic partners also result in variability in our development costs 
our primary mechanism for budgeting and tracking these costs is by type of cost incurred 
the types of costs include the following categories personnel costs  clinical costs  laboratory costs  technology license fees  research costs and facilities costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the increase was largely due to the expansion of our commercial organization  other business groups  facilities and infrastructure necessary to support the development of our pipeline and growth in all areas of our business 
significant increases were primarily in consulting  personnel expenses  and facility expenses 
amortization of intangible assets relates to existing technology  assembled workforce and goodwill acquired through the acquisitions of leukosite and cdc 
amortization expense increased to million in the period from million in the period due to a full year of amortization of the cdc goodwill and other intangible assets during versus a partial year in upon our adoption of fas effective as of january   we will continue to amortize specifically identifiable intangible assets and will cease amortizing goodwill and assembled workforce which will be reclassified to goodwill 
equity in operations of the m i joint venture was income of million for the period and a loss of million for the period 
the income in the period was primarily due to profits from the launch of campath in the us and europe and product sales by m i during the loss in the period was primarily attributable to pre product launch marketing and sales activities of the joint venture 
we sold our interest in the partnership to ilex on december  in consideration for the sale of our interest to ilex  we received million in investment income increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the increase resulted primarily from a higher average level of invested funds due to net proceeds from our public stock offering in october of million and million in net proceeds from our convertible debt offering which closed in january interest expense decreased to million for the period from million for the period due to a decrease in the average outstanding debt 
during the period and the period  we paid an aggregate of million and million in cash  respectively to certain holders of our convertible notes in order to induce the conversion of their notes into our common stock 
these cash payments were expensed during the respective periods 
the minority interest in the period consisted of the minority shareholder interest of becton  dickinson and company in the net income for the period of our then majority owned subsidiary  millennium predictive medicine  inc mpmx 
on june   we acquired the outstanding preferred stock of our mpmx subsidiary that we did not already own  making mpmx a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
we recorded a deemed preferred stock dividend of million in relating to the excess of the fair value of our common stock over the carrying value of the mpmx minority interest acquired from becton dickinson 
years ended december  and december  the following discussions relating to the net loss attributable to common stockholders and revenue for the period and for the year ended december  the period reflect pro forma results as if we had followed sab from our inception 
for the period  we had a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million or per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million or per basic and diluted share for the period 
operating results for the period represent the first reported year of fully combined revenues and expenses related to our acquisition of leukosite and five months of combined revenues and expenses related to our acquisition of cdc 
revenue under strategic alliances increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the increase is primarily attributable to revenue from a new alliance with aventis  other new alliance revenue and an increase in the revenue recognized under the bayer alliance during the period 
research and development expenses increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the increase was primarily attributable to our continued investment in clinical trials and preclinical product candidates  increased personnel and facilities expenses  increased purchases of laboratory supplies  increased technology license payments and increased professional fees 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the increase was primarily attributable to increased expenses for additional management and administrative personnel associated with the expansion and increased complexity of our operations and business development efforts 
as part of the leukosite acquisition  we also recorded a one time  noncash charge to operations in of million for acquired in process research and development 
with respect to the value of purchased research and development  we considered  among other factors  each research and development project s stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed to date  the costs already incurred  the projected costs to complete  the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets  the projected date to market and the estimated useful life 
the respective after tax cash flows were then discounted back to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
the discount rates used in the leukosite analysis ranged from to  depending upon the risk profile of the asset 
we believed and continue to believe that the assumptions used to value the acquired intangibles were reasonable at the time of the acquisition 
we cannot assure you  however  that the underlying assumptions we used to estimate projected revenues  development costs or profitability  or other events associated with such projects  will transpire as estimated 
for these reasons  among others  actual results may vary from the projected results 
the in process technology we acquired from leukosite consisted of five significant research and development projects with values assigned of million to million for each project 
these include humanized monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia  inflammatory bowel disease and the prevention of post ischemic reperfusion  small molecule chemotherapeutic agents  and a small molecule compound for treatment of bronchial asthma 
acquired in process technologies related to preclinical projects consisted of treatments primarily for inflammatory and autoimmune conditions and diseases  as well as treatments for asthma and allergies and were assigned a value of million 
through the acquisition date  leukosite had spent approximately million on all of the in process research and development projects 
we expect to incur approximately million to million for each of the four remaining significant clinical projects and approximately million for all of the projects in preclinical development to develop the in process technology into commercially viable projects 
the estimated stage of completion for acquired research and development projects ranged from to 
of the five clinical projects acquired  one project reached completion in late with the filing of a bla  while the others  which are in various stages of phase i and phase ii clinical trials  are projected to reach completion in through the first of the molecules comprising the preclinical development portfolio is projected to reach completion in to successfully complete the projects we will be required to undertake and complete a number of significant activities  including product validation  the successful completion of clinical trials and governmental regulatory approvals 
our ability to successfully complete the research and development projects will be dependent upon numerous factors over which we may have limited or no control 
if these projects are not successfully developed  we may not realize the value assigned to the in process technology 
additionally  the value of the other intangible assets acquired may also become impaired 
we are amortizing specifically identified intangible assets over four years on a straight line basis and goodwill through december   after adopting fas amortization expense for the period of million was primarily related to the leukosite acquisition 
equity in operations of the m i joint venture was a loss of million for the period 
the loss was primarily attributable to pre product launch marketing and sales activities 
investment income increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the increase resulted from an increase in our average balance of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest expense increased to million for the period from million for the period due to the issuance of our convertible subordinated notes due january  and increased capital lease obligations 
the minority interest of million in consisted of the minority shareholder interest of lilly in the net loss for the period of our then majority owned subsidiary  mbio  as well as the minority shareholder interest of becton dickinson in the net income for the period of our then majority owned subsidiary  mpmx 
in october  we issued lilly approximately  shares of millennium common stock in exchange for all mbio shares owned by it 
in december  we merged mbio with and into millennium 
we recorded a deemed preferred stock dividend of million in relating to the excess of the fair value of our common stock over the carrying value of the mbio minority interest acquired from lilly 
liquidity and capital resources we require cash to fund our operating expenses  to make capital expenditures  acquisitions and investments and to pay debt service  including principal and interest and capital lease payments 
as described above under overview expansion of operations  we expect that our cash requirements for all of these uses will increase as the scale of our operations grows 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through the following payments from our strategic collaborators including license fees  milestone payments and research funding  equity investments by our strategic collaborators  including million from abbott in for purchases of our common stock  million for purchases of our common stock under our june equity investment agreement with aventis  equity and debt offerings  including our october secondary public offering  our january issuance of our convertible subordinated notes due january   and property and equipment financings 
we expect to continue to fund our cash requirements from these external sources in the future 
in particular  we are entitled to additional committed research and development funding under a number of our strategic alliances  abbott has agreed to purchase an additional million of our common stock in five quarterly installments through and we may receive additional substantial payments from ilex as a result of our sale of our joint venture interest in m i 
in addition  commencing with the first quarter of  we anticipate that the co promotion revenue relating to sales of integrilin eptifibatide injection in the us will result in significant internally generated funds 
we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash are revenues and margins from sales of integrilin and other products and services for which we obtain marketing approval in the future  the success of our clinical and preclinical development programs  the receptivity of the capital markets to financings by biotechnology companies  our ability to enter into additional strategic collaborations and to maintain existing and new collaborations and the success of such collaborations  and whether sales of campath reach certain levels 
as of both december  and december   we had approximately billion in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
this excludes million of interest bearing marketable securities classified as restricted cash on our balance sheet  which serve as collateral for letters of credit securing leased facilities 
cash flows we used million of cash in operating activities in and million in operating activities provided cash of million in the principal use of cash in both and was to fund our net loss  which includes cash payments of million and million in and  respectively to certain holders of our convertible notes in order to induce the conversion of their notes 
the cash provided in primarily reflected the lower net loss before the in process research and development charge in connection with the leukosite acquisition 
we used cash of million in investing activities in  billion in and million in the principal uses for this purpose in all three years were net investments in marketable securities  purchases of property and equipment and other long term assets and  in  the acquisition of cdc 
financing activities provided net cash of million in  billion in and million in principal sources of net cash from financing activities in were the sale of common stock to abbott and aventis and the exercise of stock options by employees 
principal sources in were from our secondary public stock offering  our rule a sale of convertible notes and the exercise of stock options by employees 
principal sources in were the sale of a minority interest in our mpmx subsidiary to becton dickinson and the exercise of stock options by employees 
we also made payments on our capital leases aggregating million over these three years 
contractual obligations our major outstanding contractual obligations relate to our convertible notes  our capital leases from equipment financings and our facilities leases 
our facilities lease expense in future years will increase significantly over past years as a result of new lease arrangements entered into in and described below and the facilities leases assumed by us in the cor acquisition 
our convertible notes aggregate million in principal amount outstanding 
these notes consist of million of our convertible subordinated notes due  million of convertible senior notes due june  assumed by us in the cor acquisition and million of convertible subordinated notes due march  assumed by us in the cor acquisition 
all three issues of notes require semi annual interest payments through maturity 
we are required to commence an offer to repurchase the million notes assumed by us in the cor acquisition for cash at face value no later than march  and to repurchase tendered notes on april  we plan to use our existing cash and marketable securities to fund the purchase of any tendered notes 
in february  we entered into a lease agreement relating to a building to be constructed for laboratory and office space in cambridge  england 
the lease has a term of years and is expected to commence in we are responsible for a portion of the construction costs  which we estimate to be approximately million 
rent is expected to be approximately million per year and is subject to market adjustments at the end of the th  th and th years 
on august   we entered into lease agreements  relating to two buildings to be constructed for laboratory and office space in cambridge  massachusetts 
the rent obligation for each building is expected to commence on the earlier of a september  or october   respectively or b the date on which we commence occupancy of the respective building 
both leases are for a term of seventeen years 
we are responsible for a portion of the construction costs for both buildings 
our cost to complete each of the buildings is expected to be approximately and million  respectively 
rent is calculated on an escalating scale ranging from approximately million  per building per year  to approximately million  per building per year 
at december   we had pledged million of marketable securities  included in restricted cash  as collateral for letters of credit for certain leased facilities 
below is a table which presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period total less than one year years years after years long term debt      capital lease obligations including interest   operating leases      external collaborations    total contractual cash obligations    as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million to offset future federal taxable income expiring in through and million to offset future state taxable income expiring in through due to the degree of uncertainty related to the ultimate realization of such prior losses  no benefit has been recognized in the financial statements as of december  we would allocate any subsequently recognized tax benefits to operations  goodwill and additional paid in capital 
moreover  our ability to utilize these losses in future years may be limited under the change of stock ownership rules of the internal revenue service 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents  internally generated funds and the anticipated cash payments from our current strategic alliances will be sufficient to support our operations and fund our capital commitments for the near term 
our actual future cash requirements  however  will depend on many factors  including the progress of our disease research programs  the number and breadth of these programs  achievement of milestones under strategic alliance arrangements  our ability to establish and maintain additional strategic alliance and licensing arrangements  success of integrilin eptifibatide injection and additional products introduced into the market  and the progress of our development efforts and the development efforts of our strategic partners 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december  however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the interest rates on our convertible subordinated notes due january  and capital lease obligations are fixed and therefore not subject to interest rate risk 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments which would require disclosure under this item 
as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements
