overview the company enters into formal arrangements that provide for single or multiple deliverables of hardware  software and related services 
these arrangements are formalized by either a simple purchase order or by more complex contracts such as development  reseller or master agreements 
these arrangements are typically us dollar denominated and typically have an aggregate value of several thousand to several million dollars and vary in length from days to several years eg  master agreements 
agreements spanning several years are typically implemented in smaller statements of work or orders that are typically deliverable within three to twelve months 
the company derives revenues primarily from the sale of its product based solutions  where a combination of hardware  proprietary software and related services are offered to customers 
when an agreement provides for significant modification or customization of software  or when the company s system integration and product development are essential to the functionality of the software  revenues related to the software licenses and services are aggregated and the combined revenues are recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method is based on the estimated stage of completion of individual contracts determined on a cost or level of efforts basis 
any hardware or post contract customer support provided for under the terms of the agreement is unbundled 
hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery ie  transfer of title and post contract customer support is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
most of the company s professional services are delivered in conjunction with the company s solutions and are essential to the functionality of other elements of the arrangement 
however  the company occasionally sells unbundled services  and  in these instances  the company generally recognizes revenue as the services are performed 
in limited instances  the company enters into a multiple element arrangement that does not involve significant modification or customization of the related software 
in these limited instances  the company allocates revenue to each element of the arrangement based on objective evidence of the element s fair value based on internal price listings developed by the company 
revenue is recognized upon delivery ie transfer of title when a signed agreement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
revenue for a given period typically reflects products delivered or services performed during the period with respect to relatively large financial commitments from a small number of customers 
during  the company had customers each generating  or more in revenues during the period major customers and together represented approximately of total revenues 
siemens ag  the company s largest customer in fiscal year  represented approximately of total revenues and trw contributed approximately of total revenues 
during  the company had major customers representing of total revenues 
siemens ag represented approximately of revenues and winstar contributed of total revenues earned during during  the company had major customers representing of total revenues 
the average revenues earned per major customer were million in  million in and million in during fiscal and  the company experienced significant net losses from operations  primarily due to lower demand from its north american telecommunications customers 
management expects this lower demand to continue in the foreseeable future 
to offset the effects of the current lower north american demand  the company continues to target sales efforts in what it believes to be a growing market for its convergent mediation tm solutions outside of north america 
the company is focused on streamlining the organization to meet its objectives  conserve cash and control expenses 
in january  the company reduced staff by approximately of the company s then full time employees 
this reduction was designed to reduce costs without materially impacting the company s ability to maintain its historical levels of customer involvement and technological innovation 
the company plans to continue pursuing new business opportunities in partnerships and alliances with other companies  although there can be no assurances as to the timing or effectiveness of any partnering arrangements 
these arrangements could include technology and marketing alliances driven by product development requirements and sales opportunities  as well as other business combinations that would strengthen the company s product offerings and market potential 
critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants include a discussion of its critical accounting policies 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
the following is a brief discussion of the company s critical accounting policies revenue recognition the company derives revenues primarily from product based solutions  where a combination of hardware  proprietary software  and services are offered to customers 
these product based solutions are typically formalized in a multiple element arrangement involving significant modification or customization of the underlying software and implementation services 
the company s software licenses to end users generally provide for an initial license fee to use the product in perpetuity 
under certain contracts  the company licenses its software to resellers for subsequent modification and resale 
in situations when the company s product based solutions involve significant modification or customization of software  or when the company s systems integration and product development are essential to the functionality of the software  revenues relating to the software licenses and services are aggregated and the combined revenues are recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
the hardware revenue on these contracts is recognized upon transfer of title 
revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method is based on the estimated stage of completion of individual contracts determined on a cost or level of efforts basis 
in limited instances  the company enters into a multiple element arrangement that does not involve significant modification or customization of the related software 
in these limited instances  the company recognizes revenue in accordance with aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  and allocates revenue to each element of the arrangement based on objective evidence of the element s fair value based on internal price listings developed by the company 
revenue is recognized upon delivery ie  transfer of title  when a signed agreement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
our revenue recognition policy takes into consideration the creditworthiness of the customer in determining the probability of collection as a criterion for revenue recognition 
the determination of creditworthiness requires the exercise of judgment  which affects our revenue recognition 
if a customer is deemed to be not creditworthy  all revenue under arrangements with that customer is recognized only upon receipt of cash 
the creditworthiness of customers is re assessed on a regular basis and revenue is deferred until cash is received 
allowance for bad debts the allowance for doubtful accounts is established through a charge to general and administrative expenses 
this allowance is for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
it is an estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer  age of the receivable balance  individually and in aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances 
our customer base is highly concentrated in the telecommunications and internet service provider industries 
several of the leading companies in these industries have filed for bankruptcy 
if collection is not probable at the time the transaction is consummated  we do not recognize revenue until cash collection 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
results of operations the following sets forth selected consolidated data as a percentage of revenue for each of the following years ended june years ended june  revenue costs and expenses cost of revenue selling  general and administrative research and development provision for doubtful accounts income loss from operations net interest income income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss revenues total revenues in were million compared to million in and million in total revenues decreased million or in and million or in  in each case as compared to the prior year 
revenue growth depends  in part  on the overall demand for the company s product based solutions 
because the company s sales are primarily to telecommunication and internet service providers and enterprises  its ability to generate revenue also depends on specific conditions affecting those providers and on general economic conditions 
the decrease in revenues in  over the prior corresponding period  reflects the continuing weak general economic conditions and  more specifically  weak economic conditions in the domestic telecommunication and internet service provider markets 
customers in this market often rely on the capital markets to meet their ongoing cash flow requirements and to support their growth 
during  customers in this market encountered further reduced demand for their products and difficulty in accessing capital markets  resulting in the continuing reduction of demand for the company s products 
in addition  several of the company s north american customers filed for bankruptcy during consequently  revenues from sales to telecommunication and internet service providers decreased to million in  as compared to the prior year  and represented approximately of total revenues 
revenues from sales to enterprises decreased to million in  as compared to the prior year  and represented approximately of total revenues 
during  the company received a single large order of approximately million that it was not able to completely replace in the decline in sales to enterprises reflects the same weak economic conditions and the company has experienced increased competition from telecommunication equipment manufacturers who are seeking to diversify sales from the telecommunications and internet service provider markets to the overall enterprise market 
in  next generation service providers in the telecommunication and internet market began experiencing reduced demand for their products and difficulty in accessing capital markets and  as a result  the company experienced decreased demand for convergent mediation tm product based solutions 
revenues from sales to telecommunication and internet service providers decreased to million in  as compared to the prior year  and represented approximately of total revenue 
conversely  revenues from sales to enterprises increased to million in  as compared to the prior year  and represented of total revenues 
a single customer in contributed significantly to the increase in sales to enterprises

selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of costs to support the company s sales and administrative functions 
sales expenses consist primarily of salary  commission  travel  trade show  bid and proposal  and other related selling and marketing expenses required to sell our product based solutions to target markets 
general and administrative expenses consist of unallocated costs related to information systems infrastructure  facilities  finance and accounting  legal  human resources and corporate management 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  million in  and million in  representing  and of total revenues in each year  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or in  as compared to the prior year 
the decrease is primarily the result of a continuing effort to reduce expenses  which includes company and employee initiated reductions in personnel

research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of personnel costs and the associated infrastructure costs required to support the design and development of the company s product based solutions 
research and development expenses were million in compared to million in and million in research and development expenses decreased million or in and million or in  as compared to each prior corresponding period 
research and development expenses represented of revenues in and of revenues in and the decrease in research and development in and  over the prior corresponding periods  reflects a decrease in resources applied to research and development 
the company was selective in approving new projects and in some instances discontinued projects that were not related to the development of convergent mediation tm solutions 
during  research and development costs were higher  compared to the prior corresponding periods  due to an increase in resources applied to develop next generation technologies  especially convergent mediation tm solutions and a decrease in capitalized software development costs 
the company did not capitalize software development costs in  or in because the company s product development methodology generally establishes technological feasibility near the end of the development process 
provision for doubtful accounts the company recognized a net provision for doubtful accounts of million in  compared to a net provision for doubtful accounts of million in and a net recovery of million in  representing a decrease of million in and an increase of million in  in each case as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year 
beginning in and continuing through  some of the company s telecommunication and internet service provider customers who elected to reorganize under chapter of the bankruptcy code  were unable to obtain adequate financing  or were affected by unfavorable economic conditions in their respective markets 
the impact of these economic conditions on our customers  and in particular the bankruptcy filing by winstar  adversely affected the company s ability to collect outstanding accounts receivables  resulting in increased bad debts in and the company believes that it will not continue to encounter these difficulties with its current customers 
however  existing or future customers ability to pay the company may be adversely impacted by the continuing unfavorable economic conditions

additional factors affecting future operating results this annual report on form k and the other documents we file with the sec contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts and projections about the industries to which we supply solutions and in which we operate  our beliefs and our management s assumptions 
in addition  other written or oral statements that constitute forward looking statements may be made by or on behalf of us 
words such as expects  anticipates  targets  goals  projects  intends  believes  seeks  estimates  variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forward looking statements 
except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the sec  we do not have the intention or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements after the distribution of this report on form k  whether as a result of new information  future events  changes in assumptions  or otherwise 
the following items are representative of the risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome of the forward looking statements reliance on significant customers and large orders 
to date  a significant portion of our revenue has come from large financial commitments from a small number of customers 
we expect to continue to depend on a limited number of customers in any given period for a significant portion of our revenue  and in turn  to be dependent on their continuing success and positive financial results and condition 
if we fail to continue to receive orders from such customers for our solutions  or if any one or more of these customers suffers a downturn  our results will suffer 
economic conditions 
if the current uncertainty and negativity in the economic climate in the us and the rest of the world continue  our customers and our business and financial results will continue to be adversely affected 
telecommunications industry conditions 
our business and financial results are highly dependent on the telecom industry and the capital spending of our customers 
recent trends  all of which is likely to have a continuing adverse effect on us  indicate that capital spending by telecom companies has decreased and may continue to decrease in the near future as a result of the general decline in economic conditions in local and international markets  by intense competition in the development of new technology  and by the increasing reluctance of large telecom carriers to make significant capital expenditures  due  in part to increasing competition from smaller  rapidly developing alternative carriers  decreasing prices for telecom services and equipment  and regulatory rate structures that have become less dependent on the level of carriers capital expenditures 
market consolidation 
the north american communications industry has experienced significant consolidation 
in the future  there may be fewer potential customers requiring operations support systems and related services  increasing the level of competition in the industry 
in addition  larger  consolidated communication companies have strengthened their purchasing power  which could create pressure on the prices charged and the margins realized 
these companies are also striving to streamline their operations by combining different communications systems and the related operations support systems into one system  reducing the number of vendors needed 
the company may lose customers as a result of industry consolidation  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
strategic alliances 
our results could suffer further if we are unable to continue to develop or to be successful in developing strategic alliances with leading companies that provide telecommunications services or that manufacture and market network equipment  in order to expand our distribution channels and provide additional exposure for our product offerings 
credit risk 
our results could be adversely affected by non payment or slow payment of trade receivables from customers in the telecommunication services industry and government sector  or in the early stages of their development and whose financial resources may be limited 
international sales 
to the extent that a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from international sales and are therefore subject to the related risks  including the general economic conditions in each country  the overlap of different tax structures  the difficulty in managing resources in various countries  changes in regulatory requirements  compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  and longer payment cycles  our results may be adversely affected 
hiring and retention of employees 
our business and results may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully develop new  and enhance existing  products  to service our customers  and to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales and marketing and management personnel 
accurate estimates of resources necessary to complete fixed price contracts 
our sales are typically formalized in multiple element arrangements involving significant customization of the underlying software and services 
our failure to accurately estimate the resources required for a project or a failure to complete contractual obligations in a manner consistent with the project plan may result in lower than expected project margins or project losses  which would negatively impact operating results 
on occasion  we have and may be required in the future to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects 
additionally  we may fix the price of an arrangement before the final requirements are finalized 
as a result  project losses may occur that would have a negative impact on operating results 
revenue forecasting 
we may not be able to accurately forecast the timing of our revenue recognition due to the difficulty of anticipating compliance with the accounting requirements for revenue recognition and to the fact that we historically have generated a disproportionate amount of our operating revenues toward the end of each quarter 
our operating results historically have varied from fiscal period to fiscal period 
accordingly  our financial results in any particular fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results for future periods
