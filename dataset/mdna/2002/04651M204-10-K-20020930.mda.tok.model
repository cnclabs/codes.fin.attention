item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company develops  publishes  and distributes interactive games for leisure entertainment  gaming enthusiasts and children s markets for a variety of platforms 
the company employs a portfolio approach to achieve a broad base of published products across most major consumer software categories 
since it began operations in february  the company has experienced rapid growth and its product and customer mix has changed substantially 
publishing and distribution of interactive entertainment software are the two major activities of the company 
publishing is conducted through the company s three main studios santa monica  california sports racing and action adventure games  beverly  massachusetts kids family games  racing  and strategy  and minneapolis  minnesota action adventure games 
because each of these product categories has different associated costs  the company s margins have depended  and will depend  in part  on the percentage of net revenues attributable to each category 
in addition  a particular product s margin may depend on whether it has been internally or externally developed and on the platform published 
furthermore  the company s margins may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of its new published product releases 
distribution activities primarily include the sale of games produced by software publishers which are unrelated to the company third party products 
to the extent that mass merchants require greater proportions of these products  some of which may yield lower margins  the company s operating results may be negatively impacted 
the worldwide interactive entertainment software market is comprised primarily of software for personal computers pcs and dedicated game consoles  and the company develops and publishes games for all of these platforms 
during fiscal  the company s product mix consisted of pc games  sony playstation r games  sony playstation r games  nintendo game boy r and game boy r advance games  microsoft xbox r games  and games for other platforms  including sega dreamcast r 
the company believes that maintaining a healthy mix of platform distribution in its product line up is vital for its continued growth 
according to international development group idg  legacy platforms such as the multimedia home pc had an installed base of approximately million in north america in  that base is projected to increase to more than million by idg also reports that the playstation  currently the most widely distributed gaming console  had an installed base of nearly million in north america in  that base is projected to increase incrementally to approximately million in while the playstation s growth may slow  the installed base for the playstation  introduced in north america in  is projected to grow from million in to nearly million in in addition  as of november  the console market now includes new platforms from microsoft and nintendo  the xbox tm and gamecube tm  respectively 
idg projects that the xbox will have a north american installed base of approximately million by  while the gamecube is projected to have a north american installed base of more than million in the same time period 
the expansion of the gaming market  both organic and through the addition of new consoles  opens additional opportunities for the company s product while increasing the competition for market share and shelf space 
there has been an increased rate of change and complexity in the technological innovations affecting the company s products  coupled with increased competitiveness for shelf space and buyer selectivity 
the market for interactive games has become increasingly hit driven  which has led to higher production budgets  more complex development processes  longer development cycles and generally shorter product life cycles 
the importance of the timely release of hit titles  as well as the increased scope and complexity of the product development and production process  have increased the need for disciplined product development processes that limit cost and schedule overruns 
this in turn has increased the importance of leveraging the technologies  characters or storylines of such hit titles into additional interactive entertainment software products in order to spread development costs among multiple products 
in this environment  the company is determined to achieve balances between internal external development  and licensed product owned franchises 
the distribution channels for interactive software have expanded significantly in recent years 
while traditionally  consumer software was sold only through specialty stores  today  consumers have access to interactive software through a variety of outlets  including mass merchant retailers such as wal mart and target  major retailers  such as best buy  compusa  toys r us and gamestop  and specialty stores such as electronics boutique  as well as through a myriad of internet and on line networks 
effective january   the company changed its fiscal year from december to march effective april   the company changed its fiscal year from march to june accordingly  the discussion of financial results set forth below compares the year ended june  to the year ended june   the year ended june  to the year ended june   and the three month period ended june  to the three month period ended june  critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to accounts and notes receivable  inventories  intangible assets  investments  income taxes and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
sales returns  price protection  and other customer related allowances sales are recorded net of estimated future returns  price protection and other customer related allowances 
the company is not contractually obligated to accept returns  however  based on facts and circumstances at the time a customer may request approval for a return  the company may permit the exchange of products sold to certain customers 
in addition  the company may provide price protection  co operative advertising and other allowances to certain customers in accordance with industry practice 
these reserves are determined based on historical experience  budgeted customer allowances and existing commitments to customers 
although management believes it provides adequate reserves with respect to these items  actual activity could vary from management s estimates and such variances could have a material impact on reported results 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts and notes receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make payments when due or within a reasonable period of time thereafter 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories the company writes down its inventories for estimated slow moving or obsolete inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and estimated market value based upon assumed market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those assumed by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
developer royalty advances and milestone payments rapid technological innovation  shelf space competition  shorter product life cycles and buyer selectivity have made it extremely difficult to determine the likelihood of individual product acceptance and success 
as a result  the company follows the policy of expensing developer royalty advances also known as developer advances as incurred  treating such costs as research and development expenses 
generally  developers are paid an advance upon the signing of a contract with the company 
subsequent payments are due as the specific contractual milestones are met by the developer and approved by the company 
the timing of when these contracts are entered into and when milestone payments are made could vary significantly from budgeted amounts and  because these payments are expensed as incurred  they could have a material impact on reported results in a given period 
the company s success depends in part on its continued ability to obtain or renew product development agreements with independent software developers 
income taxes the company files income tax returns in every jurisdiction in which it has reason to believe it is subject to tax 
historically  the company has been subject to examination by various taxing jurisdictions 
to date  none of these examinations has resulted in any material additional tax 
nonetheless  any tax jurisdiction may contend that a filing position claimed by the company regarding one or more of its transactions is contrary to that jurisdiction s laws or regulations

euro conversion as part of the european economic and monetary union emu  a single currency the euro replaced the national currencies of most of the european countries in which the company conducts business 
the conversion rates between the euro and the participating nations currencies have been fixed irrevocably as of january   with the participating national currencies being removed from circulation between january  and june  and replaced by euro notes and coinage 
during the transition period from january  through december   public and private entities as well as individuals paid for goods and services using either checks  drafts  or wire transfers denominated in euros or the participating country s national currency 
under the regulations governing the transition to a single currency  there was a no compulsion  no prohibition rule which states that no one is obliged to utilize the euro until the notes and coinage were introduced on january  in keeping with this rule  the company is euro compliant able to receive euro denominated payments and able to invoice in euros as requested by vendors and suppliers  respectively as of january  in the affected countries

as of june   foreign operations represented and of consolidated net revenues and total assets  respectively 
the company also recorded approximately million in operating losses related to foreign operations of which approximately related to a development studio located outside the united states 
currently  substantially all of the company s business is conducted in the united states where its revenues and expenses are transacted in us dollars 
as a result  the majority of the company s results of operations are not subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the company does not hedge against foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to the limited financial exposure it faces with respect to such risk 
the company purchases certain of its inventories from foreign developers 
the company s business in this regard is subject to certain risks  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
the company s future results could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
interest rates the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on its revolving credit facility  its related party credit facility and the medium term loan 
outstanding balances under these three facilities which aggregated approximately million at june  bear interest at variable rates based on a margin over libor

for fixed rate debt including the short term promissory notes  infogrames sa subordinated convertible notes formerly the gap notes and the subordinated convertible note with a subsidiary of infogrames sa aggregating approximately million at june   interest rate changes effect the fair market value of such debt  but do not impact the company s earnings
