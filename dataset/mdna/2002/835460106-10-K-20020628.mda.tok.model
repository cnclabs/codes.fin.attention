item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview  certain factors that make future results difficult to predict  certain items to remember when reading our financial statements our quarterly operating results vary significantly depending on the timing of new product introductions and enhancements by ourselves and by our competitors 
our results also depend on the volume and timing of our professional customer orders and on shipments of our oem partners which are difficult to forecast 
because our professional customers generally order on an as needed basis and we normally ship products within one week after receipt of an order  and because our oem partners report shipments during or after the end of the period  we do not have an order backlog which can assist us in forecasting results 
for all these reasons  our results of operations for any quarter are a poor indicator of the results to be expected in any future quarter 
a large portion of our quarterly professional product revenue is usually generated in the last few weeks of the quarter 
since our ongoing operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we plan our expenditures based primarily on sales forecasts  if professional revenue generated in the last few weeks of a quarter or if oem partner shipments do not meet our forecast  operating results can be very negatively affected 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
our management is also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting period 
we periodically evaluate our estimates including those relating to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized software  and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on the specific circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying valued of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies impact the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex 
we follow very specific and detailed guidance in measuring revenue 
certain judgments  however  affect the application of our revenue policy 
we have adopted statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop  and sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain arrangements and in certain instances in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
sop generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements such as software products  hardware  upgrades  enhancements  maintenance and support  installation and training to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
the fair value of an element must be based on vendor specific objective evidence 
we have derived our revenue primarily from licenses of our software products including hardware components and maintenance and support 
revenue recognized from multiple element software arrangements are allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the fair values of elements  
table of contents such as software products and maintenance and support 
the determination of fair value is based on objective evidence specific to us 
sop requires recognition of revenue using the residual method in a multiple element arrangement when fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement 
under the residual method  the total fair value of the undelivered element is deferred and subsequently recognized in accordance with sop the difference between the total software arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
revenue from license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product including hardware has occurred  no significant obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
in addition  royalty revenue from certain distributors that do not meet our credit standards and revenues from our distributor agreement with daikin are recognized upon sell through to the end customer 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms longer than one year not to be fixed and determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
fees from development agreements  whereby the development is essential to the functionality of the licensed software  the revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
under this method  management is required to estimate the number of hours needed to complete a particular project  and revenues and profits are recognized as the contract progresses to completion 
deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which revenues have not been recognized which generally results from the following deferred maintenance and support  amounts billed to certain distributors for our products not yet sold through to the end user customers  and amounts billed to technology customers for license and development agreements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected non collection of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified in our portfolio of receivables 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if payments from customers are significantly delayed  additional allowances might be required 
capitalized software we capitalize a portion of our software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
such capitalized costs are amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated economic life of the product  which is generally three years 
see note of notes to financial statements 
periodically  we compare a product s unamortized capitalized cost to the product s net realizable value 
to the extent unamortized capitalized cost exceeds net realizable value based on the product s estimated future gross revenues  reduced by the estimated cost of sales  the excess is written off 
this analysis requires us to estimate future gross revenues associated with certain products  and the future cost of sales 
if these estimates change  write offs of capitalized software costs could result 
other contingencies we are subject to various claims relating to product  technology  patent  shareholder and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses in these matters 
the amount of loss accrual  if any  is determined after careful analysis of each matter  and is subject to adjustment if warranted 
see following discussion under risk factors titled we may become involved in costly and time consuming patent litigation 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from sonic solutions statements of operations as a percentage of net revenue for fiscal years through years ended march  net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses marketing and sales research and development general and administrative general and administrative total operating expenses operating loss other expense provision benefit for income taxes net loss comparison of fiscal years ended march   and net revenue 
our net revenue decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  representing a decrease of and increased to  in fiscal  representing an increase of 
the decrease in net revenue in fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in sales of our professional audio and dvd systems which was partially offset by the increase in sales of our consumer dvd products including dvdit 
our professional audio and dvd sales decreased approximately in fiscal which was partially offset by sales of daikin related products subsequent to our purchase of daikin s dvd business in late february sales of our consumer dvd products commenced during fiscal year in fiscal year sales of these products increased 
the increase in net revenue in fiscal was primarily due to the increase in sales of our consumer dvd products which increased approximately from fiscal the increase in fiscal year is also due to the revenue recognized on license development contracts entered into during fiscal these increases were offset in part by decreases in our professional audio and dvd sales of approximately international sales accounted for  of our net revenue in the fiscal years and international sales accounted for of our net revenue in the fiscal year see note of notes to financial statements 
international sales have historically represented around of our total sales  and we expect that they will continue to represent a significant percentage of future revenue  however possibly as a lower percentage due to the anticipated increase in domestic oem revenue related to sales of our technology and consumer dvd products 
cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased from of net revenue in fiscal to in fiscal to in fiscal the decreases in cost of revenue were primarily due to a shift in sales product mix towards higher margin consumer dvd systems and to the reduction of hardware as a percentage of revenue in our professional dvd systems 
additionally  during fiscal we recognized revenue on license development contracts which carry a relatively high margin 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience reductions in our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue in future periods  as our sales product mix shift continues to higher margin software only products and software development contracts 

table of contents marketing and sales 
our marketing and sales expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and decreased to  in fiscal marketing and sales represented  and of net revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
our marketing and sales expenses decreased in fiscal primarily due to lower commission expenses as a result of lower sales 
our marketing and sales expenses decreased in fiscal primarily due to lower advertising and collateral expenses and lower salary expense as a result of our reduction in headcount  which were offset in part by an increase in commission expense due to the increase in sales 
our marketing and sales headcount increased from forty at march  to forty nine at march  and decreased to forty four at march  dealer and employee commission expenses  as a percentage of net revenue decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal and increased to in fiscal research and development 
our research and development expenses decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and increased to  in fiscal our research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue were in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal we capitalize a portion of our software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
this means that a portion of the costs we incur for software development are not recorded as an expense in the period in which they are actually incurred 
instead they are recorded as an asset on our balance sheet 
the amount recorded on our balance sheet is then amortized over the estimated life of the products in which the software is included 
during fiscal we capitalized approximately  and amortized approximately  and during fiscal we capitalized approximately  excluding the amount capitalized with the daikin acquisition and amortized  we expect to continue to amortize more than we capitalize 
our research and development expenses decreased in fiscal primarily due to reduced consulting expenses associated with product development 
headcount remained consistent at thirty two from march  to march  research and development expenses increased in fiscal primarily due to increased headcount from thirty two at march  to forty nine at march  general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and decreased to  in fiscal these expenses represented of net revenue in fiscal  of net revenue in fiscal and of net revenue in fiscal our general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal primarily due to an increase in legal and professional expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal primarily due to reduced legal fees and a reversal of previously recorded bad debt reserve 
we expect that general and administrative expenses may increase as our operations expand 
other income and expense 
other expense on our statement of operations includes primarily the amount of interest or other financing charges we have incurred due to borrowings 
for our  and fiscal years  we incurred interest and other financing charges related to financing agreements we had with entities associated with hambrecht quist  as well as borrowings under our bank credit line which expired in the fiscal year 
other income includes the interest we earned on cash balances and short term investments 
provision for income taxes 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we made no provision for income taxes for our and years 
for the fiscal year a benefit was recorded during the quarter ended june  to reflect the refund due us following the conclusion of an internal revenue service audit 
for the fiscal year foreign tax expense was recorded to reflect the cumulative taxes withheld by various japanese customers and paid to the japanese taxing authorities 
in the fiscal year ended march   we exhausted our ability to carryback tax losses resulting from operations 
liquidity and capital resources 
in march   we renegotiated a previous financing arrangement with hambrecht quist guaranty finance 
the agreement we reached involved the restructuring of  debt into  of series c convertible preferred stock see note of notes to financial statements and  of debt 
the interest rate on such restructured debt was and was due in october we filed a form s registration statement under the securities act of to register the resale of the  shares of the company s common stock which underlie the series c convertible preferred stock issued to hambrecht

in connection with the agreement  the exercise price of  of the warrants issued with the original arrangement reached in december was lowered to the fair value of common stock of 
we accounted for this transaction by revaluing the new warrants  using comparable assumptions as the original warrant grant  and the resultant value of  was amortized over the new loan period 
in june    of the warrants were exercised on a net exercise basis  and the warrant holder received  shares of common stock 
during the fiscal year ended march   the remaining  shares of the preferred stock were converted into common stock pursuant to this financing arrangement 
in october   we renegotiated a financing arrangement with hambrecht quist guaranty finance 
the agreement we reached involved the restructuring of  debt into  shares of series c convertible preferred stock and  of debt 
the interest rate on the restructured debt is and the debt and interest were payable in monthly installments through april  in connection with this agreement  we issued warrants to purchase  common shares at an exercise price of 
these warrants expire on april  we also enhanced the conversion rate of hambrecht and quist s existing series c convertible preferred stock so that each share of series c convertible preferred stock is convertible into shares of common stock 
the beneficial conversion feature  warrants and new debt were recorded at their relative fair values 
we recorded  of deferred financing costs attributable to this finance restructuring with hambrecht quist guaranty 
this amount is being amortized using the effective interest rate method to interest expense over the term of the financing facility months 
the fair value of the warrants was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions volatility of  risk free interest rate of and expected life equal to the contractual terms 
we filed a form s registration statement under the securities act of to register the shares of the common stock which underlie the series c convertible preferred stock and the  shares of our common stock which underlie the warrants issued to hambrecht quist guaranty finance 
during the fiscal year ended march    of the warrants were exercised on a net exercise basis  and the warrant holder received  shares of common stock 
subsequent to fiscal year ended march   in april  the remaining  of the warrants were exercised 
on may   we secured a new equity based line of credit by entering into a new stock purchase agreement with kingsbridge 
under this arrangement  we were able to draw up to  in cash in exchange for common stock 
pricing of the common stock issued under this arrangement was based on the market price of our common stock at the time of a draw  discounted by or  depending upon the price of our common stock 
the availability of the credit line  and the amounts and timing of draws under the line were subject to a number of conditions 
on may   we filed a registration statement on form s to register for resale the shares we may issue to kingsbridge under this credit line and on august  the statement became effective 
during the fiscal year ended march   we drew  from the credit line for which we issued  shares of common stock 
because of limitations on the total number of shares that could be issued under this line of credit  this facility is no longer available to us and was terminated on march  on may   we secured a new equity based line of credit by entering into a new stock purchase agreement with kingsbridge 
under the new agreement  we may sell up to  worth of our common stock  but not to exceed that number of shares of common stock which equals of our outstanding shares 
when we sell shares to kingsbridge the price per share is set by a formula at a discount from the market price of our common stock around the time of the sale to kingsbridge 
that discount ranges from to 
our ability to sell stock to kingsbridge is contingent upon a number of terms and conditions  including for example  continued listing on nasdaq  effectiveness of a registration statement  continued accuracy of representations and warranties made to kingsbridge and lack of material adverse changes to our business 
the quantity and timing of sales that we are able to make under the equity line agreement are also limited by the market price and trading volume of our stock 
because of these limitations at the time we need cash in the future  the equity line arrangement with kingsbridge may be unavailable or insufficient to meet our cash needs 
on july   we filed a registration statement on form s to register for resale the shares we may issue to kingsbridge under this credit line and on november  the statement became effective 
during the fiscal year ended 
table of contents march   we drew  from the credit line for which we issued  shares of common stock 
during the fiscal year ended march   we drew  from the credit line for which we issued  shares of common stock 
the maximum number of shares we could sell after march  under this agreement would be approximately  shares with gross proceeds of approximately  our operating activities have used cash of  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year and generated cash of  in fiscal year during fiscal year  cash used in operations included a net loss of  including depreciation and amortization of  cash used in operations was affected by changes in assets and liabilities including increases in inventory of  prepaid expenses of  and other assets of  and by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  and deferred revenue and deposits of  in fiscal  net accounts receivables decreased by  however days outstanding increased to days 
during fiscal year  we recorded a charge to bad debt expense of  which represented a reserve for sales to audio professionals and distributors who were experiencing liquidity difficulties due to a decline in their business

during the fiscal years discussed above  our current ratio has fluctuated  primarily due to the increase in our deferred revenue and deposits 
during fiscal year  our current ratio increased over fiscal year  primarily due to increase in cash from deposits and prepayments received from oem and licensing customers which was offset in part by the increase in the deferred revenue account 
in addition to our operations  we utilized cash during the  and fiscal years primarily to purchase new fixed assets  pay down debt obligations and to develop and purchase software that was added to capitalized software 
during the  and the fiscal years we augmented cash on hand primarily by drawing on the equity credit lines described above 
we cannot estimate the impact  if any  on the trading price of our common stock in the event that we sell shares in the future under the equity line 
future sales may depress our stock price since stock is sold under the equity line at approximately an to discount from the market price 
for a further discussion of the potential effect of future sales under the equity line  see the risk factor our equity line agreement with kingsbridge capital limited may be unavailable or insufficient to meet our future cash needs  issuance of stock under that agreement may also dilute our shareholders  adversely affect our earnings per share and may reduce our share price 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  available credit and cash generated from operations  plus cash available through the equity based line of credit with kingsbridge will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal year as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  
table of contents risk factors 
you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below we have had losses in each of the past five fiscal years 
we were unprofitable during each of the last five fiscal years 
for example  in fiscal year  we had a net loss of  and in fiscal year we had a net loss of  we were unprofitable during each quarter of the and fiscal years and during the first three quarters of the fiscal year 
we were profitable in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
although we have provided revenue and profitable earnings guidance for fiscal  there are no assurances that we will meet such guidance and our inability to meet such guidance could cause our share price to decline 
the other risks identified below could also cause the value of our shares to decline 
we cannot  however  estimate the likelihood that our shares may decline in value or the amount by which they may decline 
during the fiscal years ended march  and  we had negative operating cash flows 
during the fiscal years ended march  and  we had a negative operating cash flow of  and  respectively 
this means that without access to outside capital we would have had to cease or significantly curtail operations 
during the fiscal year ended march   we had a positive operating cash flow of  the positive cash flow for fiscal year ended march  was due primarily to the increase in sales and the increase in deferred revenue 
there are no assurances that we will continue to report positive operating cash flow in the future  and we might need to obtain additional financing to continue to operate 
if we are unable to obtain such financing  then we may have to cease or significantly curtail operations 
our equity line agreement with kingsbridge capital limited may be unavailable or insufficient to meet our future cash needs  issuance of stock under that agreement may also dilute our shareholders  adversely affect our earnings per share  and may reduce our share price 
in may  we entered into an equity line agreement with kingsbridge capital limited which allows us to sell our common stock to kingsbridge from time to time 
under the agreement we may sell up to  worth of our common stock  but only up to that number of shares of common stock which equals of our outstanding shares 
when we sell shares to kingsbridge the price per share is equal to the market price of our common stock around the time of the sale to kingsbridge minus a discount 
that discount ranges from to 
as of march   we have sold under this agreement  shares of common stock with gross proceeds to us of approximately  because of the limit on the number of shares we may sell to kingsbridge  the maximum number of shares we could sell after march  under this agreement would be approximately  shares with gross proceeds of approximately  sale of the maximum number of shares could result in dilution to our shareholders of approximately 
stated another way  if we sold the maximum number of shares to kingsbridge  then the ownership percentage of our existing shareholders excluding insider ownership would decline from approximately to approximately of our company 
our ability to sell stock to kingsbridge is contingent upon a number of terms and conditions  including  for example  continued listing of our stock on nasdaq  continued effectiveness of a registration statement  continued accuracy of representations and warranties made to kingsbridge and lack of material adverse changes to our business 
the quantity and timing of sales that we are able to make under the equity line agreement are also limited by the market price and trading volume of our stock 
the risk to us is that because of these limitations  at the time we need cash in the future  the stock sale arrangement with kingsbridge may be unavailable or insufficient to meet our cash needs 
issuances of shares under the equity line agreement with kingsbridge will result in a greater number of our shares outstanding 
as a result  to the extent we have net income  net income per share will be lower due to the larger number of shares outstanding 

table of contents the risk of dilution from sales of stock to kingsbridge may cause our stock price to decline 
the perceived risk of dilution from sales of stock to kingsbridge may cause holders of our stock to sell their shares or it may encourage short sales 
this could contribute to a decline in our share price 
recent and future acquisitions may compromise our operations and financial results 
on may   we entered into an agreement with axeda in which axeda will license ravisent s software dvd player and other digital media technologies to us 
under this agreement  we paid axeda a one time fee of million for the license and related agreements  and in return will obtain exclusive rights to deploy the ravisent technologies in the personal computer market 
in addition  we acquired certain key engineers from axeda 
any failure to successfully integrate the axeda technology or employees could impact us negatively 
this license agreement and the integration of the ravisent s products involves risk for us and for our shareholders 
these risks include distracting management from day to day operations of our current business  costs  delays and inefficiencies associated with integrating the new technology  undiscovered and unknown problems  defects or other issued related to the ravisent s products that become known to us only some time after the acquisition  the ravisent business line was not profitable when owned by axeda 
it is possible that the ravisent technology and employees will not be a positive contributor to our operations and instead will constitute a drain on our resources 
as part of our efforts to enhance our existing products and introduce new products  we may pursue acquisitions of complementary companies  products and technologies 
acquisitions could adversely affect our operating results in the short term as a result of dilutive issuances of equity securities or usage of our cash and the incurrence of additional debt costs 
the purchase price for an acquired company may exceed its book value  creating goodwill  possibly resulting in significant impairment write downs charged to our operating results in future periods 
we have limited experience in acquiring and integrating outside businesses and other acquisitions are likely to involve similar risks to those identified above 
if new digital formats are unsuccessful  it is unlikely that we will generate sufficient revenues to recover our development cost 
our business involves new digital audio and video formats  such as dvd video and dvd audio  and  more recently  the new recordable dvd formats including dvd ram  dvd r rw and dvd rw 
if these formats prove to be unsuccessful or are not accepted for any reason  there will be only limited demand for our products 
we may have to incur significant product redesign costs if chip manufacturers discontinue or redesign their products 
our products are based on integrated circuits or chips produced by other companies 
for example  we use the ibm i chip manufactured by ibm and the motorola dsp chip manufactured by motorola 
if these chip manufacturers or another chip manufacturer that we may be using discontinues or redesigns the chips we use for our products  then we will likely incur significant costs to redesign our products to handle these changes 
we cannot estimate the amount of these costs or the likelihood that we will have to redesign our products 
our reliance on outsourcing and single suppliers for our manufacturing and components makes us vulnerable to supplier operational problems 
our outsourcing manufacturing program commits responsibility for almost all of our manufacturing activities to a single supplier arrow bell electronics 
in addition  we often use components that are only 
table of contents available from a single source 
those components include  for example  phillip s video scaler and various xilinx devices 
reliance on a single supplier for manufacturing or for certain manufacturing components makes us vulnerable to operating or financial problems encountered by those suppliers 
if we fail to protect our products intellectual property rights  such as trade secrets  we may not be able to market our products successfully 
our products are based in large part on proprietary technology which we have sought to protect with patents  trademarks and trade secrets 
for example  we have numerous patents and we have also filed applications for additional patents 
we also registered trademarks for the following dvdit  mydvd  dvd creator  and dvd fusion  among others 
to the extent that we use patents to protect our proprietary rights  we may not be able to obtain needed patents or  if granted  the patents may be held invalid or otherwise indefensible 
in addition  we make extensive use of trade secrets that we may not be able to protect 
to the extent we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  competitors may enter the market offering products identical to ours  with a negative impact on sales of our products 
other companies intellectual property rights may interfere with our current or future product development and sales 
we have never conducted a comprehensive patent search relating to the technology we use in our products 
there may be issued or pending patents owned by third parties that relate to our products 
if so  we could incur substantial costs defending against patent infringement claims or we could even be blocked from selling our products 
other companies may succeed in obtaining valid patents covering one or more of the key techniques we utilize in our products 
if so  we may be forced to obtain required licenses or implement alternative non infringing approaches 
our products are designed to adhere to industry standards  such as dvd rom  dvd video  dvd audio and mpeg video 
a number of companies and organizations hold various patents that claim to cover various aspects of dvd and mpeg technology 
we have entered into license agreements with certain companies relative to some of these technologies 
for instance  we have entered into license agreements with dolby licensing corporation covering dolby digital audio and with meridian audio limited covering meridian lossless packing 
such license agreements may not be sufficient to grant all of the intellectual property rights to us necessary to market our products 
we may become involved in costly and time consuming patent litigation 
third parties could pursue us claiming that our products infringe various patents 
patent infringement litigation can be time consuming and costly 
if the litigation resulted in an unfavorable outcome for us  we could be subject to substantial damage claims and a requirement that we obtain a royalty or license agreement to continue using the technology in issue 
such royalty or license agreements might not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all  resulting in serious harm to our business 
for example  a group of companies have formed an organization called mpeg la to enforce the rights of holders of patents covering aspects of mpeg video technology 
we have been asked by mpeg la to enter into a license agreement with them 
we have not entered into such an agreement with mpeg la  though we are continuing to evaluate the situation 
the cost to us of such a license cannot be estimated at this time 
because a large percentage of our professional audio and dvd products operate only on macintosh computers  the potential success of our products is tied to the success of this platform 
many of our current professional audio and dvd products  including dvd creator and dvd fusion  operate on macintosh computers manufactured by apple computer 
if macintosh computers become in short 
table of contents supply  sales of our products will likely decline 
if there is a decrease in the use of the macintosh as a computing platform in the professional and corporate audio and video markets  there will likely be a decrease in demand for our products 
if there are changes in the operating system or architecture of the macintosh  it is likely that we will incur significant costs to adapt our products to the changes 
our macintosh users generally demand that we maintain compatibility with the latest models of the macintosh and the macintosh os 
currently our dvd creator and dvd fusion applications run only in os while os x currently offers a compatibility mode which supports os x compatible applications  we believe that we will soon have to modify our macintosh creator and fusion applications for them to continue to be able to run with the latest macintosh models 
such a modification may be difficult to accomplish and if it proves to be lengthy our revenues could be significantly reduced in the interim 
because a large portion of our net revenue is from oem customers  the potential success of our products is tied to the success of their product sales 
much of our consumer revenue is derived from sales to large oem customers  which include for example dell  hewlett packard  sony  matrox and avid 
the revenue from many of these customers is recognized on a sell thru basis 
if there is a decrease in unit sales by these customers  our net revenue will decrease 
some of our competitors possess greater technological and financial resources than we do  may produce better or more cost effective products than ours and may be more effective than we are in marketing and promoting their products 
there is a substantial risk that competing companies will produce better or more cost effective products  or will be better equipped than we are to promote them in the marketplace 
a number of companies have announced or are delivering products which compete with our products 
these include ahead  apple computer  cyberlink  dazzle a division of scm microsystems  intervideo  inc  mediostream  pinnacle  roxio and ulead 
see discussion entitled competition for desktop products in the business section of this document 
most of these companies have greater financial and technological resources than ours 
in april  apple computer announced the acquisition of the dvd authoring business of astarte gmbh 
prior to the acquisition  astarte sold a dvd authoring system that competed primarily with our dvd fusion product 
in january  apple announced two new dvd authoring products  which we presume are based on astarte s technology 
the first product  idvd  is intended for consumer users and we believe will compete with mydvd and dvdit the second product  dvd studio pro  is intended for professional users  and competes with dvdit pe  dvd fusion and reeldvd 
apple also announced the availability of aggressively priced dvd recorders with certain models of their macintosh personal computer 
in mid  apple purchased spruce technologies  a long standing competitor of ours in the professional dvd market 
while it is unclear to us what apple intends to do with the assets it acquired from spruce  it is quite likely that this acquisition will bolster apple s dvd technology base and make their products more competitive with our products 
our reliance on outsourcing our web store makes us vulnerable to third party s operational problems 
we have initiated a web based retail store for our dvdit and mydvd products as well as some of our professional products  for example  reeldvd  that are priced in a range that is typically sold over the internet 
we currently outsource our web store through an arrangement we have with digital river 
under this arrangement  digital river provides the servers which list our products and handle all purchase transactions through their secure web site 
we believe that outsourcing our web store gives us significant benefits  in terms of security  flexibility and overall cost 
however  outsourcing means that we are dependent on a third party for smooth operation of our web store 
our web store sales are a significant portion of our revenues and  we expect  will produce an increasing revenue stream for us 
interruption of our web store could have a negative effect on our business 

table of contents we have little ability to reduce expenses to compensate for reduced sales 
we tend to close a number of sales in the last month or last weeks of a quarter and we generally do not know until quite late in a quarter whether our sales expectations for the quarter will be met 
for example  in recent quarters  as much as of our professional sales have been procured in the last month of the quarter 
because most of our quarterly operating expenses and our inventory purchasing are committed prior to quarter end  we have little ability to reduce expenses to compensate for reduced sales 
approximately of our revenue derives from sales to a single company and another and was derived from sales to two large distributors in fiscal year during the last three fiscal years   and  between and of our revenue was derived from sales of audio processing subsystems to discreet logic 
during the fiscal years   and an additional  and  respectively  of our revenue was derived from sales to our japanese dealer  sanshin electronics company who is also a shareholder in the company 
additionally  during the fiscal year ended  and additional of our revenue was derived from sales to daikin industries  ltd  our japanese distributor and a shareholder in the company 
a decrease or interruption in any of the above mentioned businesses or their demand for our products would cause a significant decrease in our revenue 
a significant portion of our revenue derives from sales made to foreign customers located primarily in europe and japan 
revenue derived from these customers accounted for approximately and of our revenues in fiscal years and  respectively
