results of operations fiscal year ended july  versus fiscal year ended july  gas liquid and related product sales 
total gas liquids and related product sales decreased  due to a decrease in the average propane sales price per gallon and an additional  primarily due to a significant decrease in retail propane sales volume 
the average propane sales price per gallon decreased due to the effect of a significant decrease in the wholesale cost of propane 
in addition  retail sales volumes decreased to  gallons in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the effects of the significantly warmer than normal weather and to a lesser extent the weak national economy 
the heating season of fiscal november through march was the third warmest in recorded united states history  according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa data  with national average temperatures warmer than normal compared to colder than normal for the same period last year 
during the peak winter heating season december through february average national temperatures were warmer than normal 
other revenues 
other revenues decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to lower appliance sales and service labor related to the effect of the weak national economy 
cost of product sold 
cost of product sold decreased  due to the significant decline in the wholesale cost of propane during fiscal and an additional  primarily due to the effect of the decline in retail sales volume compared to last year 
the propane wholesale market price at one of the major supply points  mt 
belvieu  texas  averaged per gallon during fiscal compared to an average of per gallon for the prior year 
other major supply points in the united states also experienced significant declines in propane prices 
however  cost of product sold increased  due to exceptional results from risk management trading activities recognized in fiscal that were not repeated in fiscal see additional discussion regarding risk management trading activities in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased primarily due to the effect of a significant decrease in retail propane volumes and to a lesser extent  the decrease in results from risk management trading activities 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in retail margin per gallon 
operating expense 
operating expense decreased primarily due to a  decrease in operating expenses incurred at our retail distribution outlets generally resulting from fewer gallons delivered to customers in fiscal as compared to fiscal general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased primarily due to increased performance based incentive compensation expense 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily due to the implementation of sfas no 
 which eliminated goodwill amortization 
see further discussion of the implementation of sfas no 
in note b to the consolidated financial statements 
equipment lease expense 
equipment lease expense decreased due to the impact that significantly lower interest rates had on our variable rate operating leases as compared to fiscal see further discussion about these leases in liquidity and capital resources investing activities and financing activities 
loss gain on disposal of assets and other 
loss on disposal of assets and other decreased  primarily due to a decrease in the activity related to the transfer of accounts receivables pursuant to the accounts receivable securitization facility 
see further discussion about this facility in liquidity and capital resources investing activities and financing activities 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased primarily due to reduced borrowings and the impact that significantly lower interest rates had on our credit facility borrowings 
this decrease was partially offset by the effect of the termination of an interest rate swap agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal forward looking statements 
our gross profit  operating income and net earnings each declined between and from fiscal to in fiscal  we also recognized decreases in gas liquids and related product sales  cost of product sold  operating expenses  equipment lease expense  and depreciation and amortization expense 
warm winter weather  a significant decrease in interest rates and the elimination of goodwill amortization during fiscal largely contributed to these decreases 
assuming that the weather remains the same as in fiscal or becomes colder and that interest rates remain relatively stable  we do not anticipate similar decreases in revenue  gross profit  operating expenses and operating income as was recognized in fiscal versus fiscal we will implement sfas no 
beginning in the fiscal year ending july   and expect to record a one time reduction to earnings during the first quarter of fiscal  as a cumulative change in accounting principle  of approximately  we believe the implementation will not have a material ongoing effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  as a result of the redemption of our  senior secured notes in september  we will reflect an approximate  charge to earnings related to the premium and other costs incurred to redeem the notes plus the write off of financing costs related to the original issuance of the notes in see further discussion about this debt redemption in liquidity and capital resources financing activities 
fiscal year ended july  versus fiscal year ended july  gas liquid and related product sales 
total gas liquids and related product sales increased  due to an increased average sales price per gallon and an additional  primarily due to increased retail sales volumes 
the average sales price per gallon increased due to the effect of a significant increase in the wholesale cost of propane during fiscal  which was significantly higher as compared to fiscal retail sales volumes increased to  gallons in fiscal as compared to  gallons for the prior year  primarily due to the acquisition of thermogas completed in december and the effect of colder weather  partially offset by the impact of customer conservation caused by the higher product cost environment 
during the heating season of fiscal  temperatures as reported by noaa were colder than normal as compared to temperatures warmer than normal during the same period in fiscal other revenues 
other revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the acquisition of thermogas completed in december cost of product sold 
cost of product sold increased  due to a significant increase in the wholesale cost of propane during fiscal and an additional  primarily due to the increase in retail sales volumes delivered compared to fiscal the propane wholesale market price at one of the major supply points  mt 
belvieu  texas  averaged per gallon during fiscal compared to an average of per gallon for the prior year 
other major supply points in the united states also experienced significant increases in propane prices 
cost of product sold increased  due to lower gains from risk management trading activities in fiscal compared to the prior year s exceptional performance 
gross profit 
gross profit increased primarily due to increased retail margins  the effect on sales related to the colder than normal weather and the acquired thermogas operations  partially offset by lower gains from risk management trading activities 
see additional discussion regarding risk management trading activities in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note j to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
operating expense 
operating expense increased primarily due to operating expenses related to the acquired thermogas operations and to a lesser extent the increased cost of incentives resulting from our improved financial performance 
this increase was partially offset by favorable expense management related to the completed integration of the thermogas acquisition and expense savings initiatives established late in fiscal year general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased primarily due to incentives resulting from the improved financial performance of the company as compared to last year and due to expenses incurred related to business process reviews 
prior to the acquisition by us  thermogas incurred in excess of  in general and administrative expenses per year 
as a result of our acquisition of thermogas and the complete integration of the general and administrative services into our operations  we were able to eliminate approximately of these overhead costs  thus realizing the expected general and administrative cost reduction from the acquisition 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily due to the change in the estimated residual values of customer and storage tanks  partially offset by the depreciation and amortization expense from the addition of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets from the thermogas acquisition 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we increased the estimate of the residual values of our existing customer and storage tanks 
this increase in the residual values resulted from a review by our management of tank values established through an independent tank valuation obtained in connection with a financing completed in december due to this change in the tank residual values  depreciation expense decreased by approximately  compared to the depreciation that would have been recorded using the previously estimated residual values 
the change in estimated residual values will continue to affect future depreciation expense as compared to the depreciation that would have been recorded using the previously estimated residual values 
equipment lease expense 
equipment lease expense increased due to the addition of the  operating leases in december  and to a lesser extent to upgrades to our truck fleet 
loss gain on disposal of assets and other 
loss on disposal of assets and other increased  primarily due the loss on disposal of fixed assets and losses related to the transfer of accounts receivables pursuant to the accounts receivable securitization 
see note e to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding the accounts receivable securitization 
interest expense 
interest expense increased primarily due to the result of increased borrowings related to the thermogas acquisition  partially offset by the effect of reduced credit facility borrowings during fiscal and interest rate savings resulting from an interest rate swap arrangement in effect during most of the fiscal year 
in june  the interest rate swap agreement was terminated by the counterparty 
the reduced credit facility borrowings resulted primarily from the funds generated from the accounts receivable securitization facility 
see discussion of the transactions between us and ferrellgas receivables in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources financing activities 
other charges 
on april   we announced a series of transactions that increased the cash distribution coverage to our public unitholders and modified the structure of our outstanding senior units 
see additional discussion of this transaction in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources financing activities 
we incurred  in banking  legal and other fees related to these transactions 
liquidity and capital resources our ability to satisfy our obligations is dependent upon future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic  financial  business  and weather conditions and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
during fiscal the united states experienced unusually mild temperatures that were approximately warmer than normal during the winter heating season november through march and warmer than normal during the peak winter heating season december through february 
these temperatures rank as the third warmest winter heating season and fifth warmest peak winter heating season in the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s year history 
moreover  the weather has been significantly warmer than normal in four of the last five winter heating seasons 
despite these challenges  we paid the minimum quarterly distribution of on all common units on september   which represents the thirty second consecutive minimum quarterly distribution paid to our common unitholders dating back to october due to the seasonality of the retail propane distribution business  a significant portion of our cash flow from operations is generated during the winter heating season which occurs during our second and third fiscal quarters 
we generate significantly lower cash flows from operations in our first and fourth fiscal quarters as compared to the second and third quarters because fixed costs exceed gross profit during the non peak heating season 
subject to meeting the financial tests discussed below  our general partner believes that ferrellgas  lp will have sufficient funds available to meet its obligations  and to distribute to ferrellgas partners sufficient funds to permit ferrellgas partners to meet its obligations with respect to the  senior notes 
in addition  our general partner believes that ferrellgas  lp will have sufficient funds available to distribute to ferrellgas partners sufficient cash to pay the required quarterly distribution on the senior units and the minimum quarterly distribution on all common units during fiscal our credit facilities  public debt  private debt  accounts receivable securitization facility and operating tank leases contain several financial tests and covenants restricting our ability to pay distributions  incur debt and engage in certain other business transactions 
in general  these tests are based on our debt to cash flow ratio and cash flow to interest expense ratio 
our general partner believes that the most restrictive of these tests currently are debt incurrence limitations within the credit facility  operating tank leases and accounts receivable securitization facility and limitations on the payment of distributions within ferrellgas partners senior notes 
the credit facility  operating tank leases and accounts receivable securitization facility generally limit ferrellgas  lp s ability to incur debt if it exceeds prescribed ratios of either debt to cash flow or cash flow to interest expense 
ferrellgas partners senior notes restrict payments if a minimum ratio of cash flow to interest expense is not met  assuming certain exceptions to this ratio limit have previously been exhausted 
this restriction places limitations on our ability to make restricted payments such as the payment of cash distributions to unitholders 
the cash flow used to determine these financial tests generally is based upon our most recent cash flow performance giving pro forma effect for acquisitions and divestitures made during the test period 
it should be noted that none of our credit facilities  public debt  private debt  accounts receivable securitization facility or operating tank leases contain repayment provisions related to a decline in our credit rating 
as of july   our general partner believes that we met all the required quarterly financial tests and covenants 
based upon current estimates of our cash flow  our general partner believes that we will be able to continue to meet all of the required quarterly financial tests and covenants 
however  if we were to encounter unexpected downturns in business operations in the future  such as significantly warmer than normal weather  a volatile energy commodity cost environment or continued economic downturn  we may not meet the applicable financial tests in future quarters 
this could have a materially adverse effect on our operating capacity and cash flows and could restrict our ability to incur debt or to make cash distributions to our unitholders  even if sufficient funds were available 
depending on the circumstances  we may consider alternatives to permit the incurrence of debt or the continued payment of the quarterly cash distribution to our unitholders 
no assurances can be given  however  that such alternatives can or will be implemented with respect to any given quarter 
our future capital expenditures and working capital needs are expected to be provided by cash generated from future operations  existing cash balances  the credit facility or the accounts receivable securitization facility 
to fund expansive capital projects and future acquisitions  we may borrow on our facilities  we may issue additional debt to the extent permitted under existing financing arrangements or we may issue additional equity securities  including  among others  common units 
toward this purpose  on february   we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the periodic sale of equity and or debt securities 
the registered securities are available to us for sale in the future to fund acquisitions  to reduce indebtedness or to provide funds for general corporate purposes 
on june   we issued  worth of equity common units and on september   we issued  worth of debt  both pursuant to this registration statement 
we currently have approximately  remaining available under this registration statement for the sale of registered securities in the future 
see further discussion about debt issuance in liquidity and capital resources financing activities 
we also maintain a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for  common units 
we may issue these common units in connection with our acquisition of other businesses  properties or securities in business combination transactions 
operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal this increase is primarily due to improved working capital principally reflected in o the decrease in accounts receivable  net of the change in the related funding from the accounts receivable securitization facility  o the decrease in inventory  primarily attributable to the decreased cost of propane and lower inventory volumes  and o the effect of timing of payments on accounts payable 
investing activities 
during fiscal  we made cash capital expenditures of  consisting primarily of the following o technology and process enhancement initiative discussed in the following paragraph  o upgrading district plant facilities  o vehicle lease buyouts  and o additional propane storage tanks and cylinders 
during fiscal  we completed a review of our key business processes to identify areas where we could use technology to improve our operational efficiency 
specifically  we identified areas where we believe we can reduce operating expenses and improve customer satisfaction in the near future 
these areas of opportunity include improvements to our routing and scheduling of customer deliveries  customer administration and operational workflow 
during fiscal  we allocated considerable resources toward these improvements  including the purchase of computer hardware and software and development of new software 
the capital expenditures related to the technology and process enhancement initiative were funded primarily from excess cash generated from operations during our record financial performance in fiscal year these capital expenditures represent a substantial majority of the capital expenditures we expect to incur in connection with this initiative 
we intend to fund any remaining capital requirements from cash generated from future operations or funds available from our credit facility or accounts receivable securitization facility 
we incurred the following expenditures related to this initiative in fiscal and in thousands capital expenditures expensed items fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal development of new computer software  purchased computer software and licenses  computer hardware and other equipment operating expense  general and administrative expenses  total incurred    less amounts payable to vendors  total cash used for technology initiative    other than this initiative  our capital requirements for repair and maintenance of property  plant and equipment are expected to remain relatively low 
we lease computers  light and medium duty trucks  tractors and trailers 
we believe vehicle leasing is a cost effective method for meeting our transportation and technology equipment needs 
we purchased  of vehicles whose lease terms expired during fiscal we utilize an accounts receivable securitization facility for the purpose of providing us with additional short term working capital funding  especially during the winter heating months 
as part of this day facility  we transfer an interest in a pool of our trade accounts receivable to ferrellgas receivables  llc  our wholly owned  qualifying special purpose entity  which sells its interest to a commercial paper conduit of banc one  na 
we do not provide any guarantee or similar support to the collectability of these receivables 
we structured the facility using a wholly owned  qualifying special purpose entity in order to facilitate the transaction as required by banc one  na and to comply with our various debt covenants 
we remit daily to this special purpose entity funds collected on its pool of trade receivables 
this unconsolidated entity  together with the accounts receivable securitization facility  provide us additional working capital liquidity at interest rates approximately one half of one percent lower than borrowings from our credit facility  based on the most recent twelve month period 
the level of funding available from this facility is currently limited to the lesser of  or qualified trade accounts receivable 
at july   there was no outstanding balance from this facility 
during fiscal  the funding outstanding from this facility was reduced by  to zero 
this decrease in funding resulted from our reduced liquidity needs caused primarily by the significant decrease in the amount of account receivables outstanding and lower inventory levels related primarily to the lower wholesale propane cost environment experienced for most of this fiscal year as compared to last year 
we renewed this facility effective september   for a day commitment with banc one  na in accordance with sfas no 
 this transaction is reflected on our consolidated financial statements as a sale of accounts receivable and an investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary 
see note e to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion about this facility 
we continue to consider opportunities to expand our operations through strategic acquisitions of retail propane operations located throughout the united states 
during the fiscal year ended july   we made total acquisition capital expenditures of approximately  pursuant to the acquisition of three retail propane companies 
this amount was funded by approximately  of cash payments  the issuance of  in common units and  in notes and other consideration 
financing activities 
on september   we issued  of publicly held senior notes at a fixed rate of due interest is payable semi annually in arrears on june and december  commencing on december  these new notes are unsecured and not redeemable before june   except under specific circumstances 
we used the proceeds from the new senior note issuance to repurchase and redeem our  fixed rate senior secured notes due  including related premiums  fees  accrued and unpaid interest and tender consent payments 
we paid the required quarterly distribution on the senior units and the minimum quarterly distribution on all common units  as well as general partner interests  totaling  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in cash distributions from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to o a full year of cash distributions paid in fiscal on the  common units issued in june  and o cash distributions paid on the senior units for a full year in fiscal as compared to in kind distributions paid for two quarters in fiscal on september   we paid our fourth fiscal quarter cash distribution of and per senior and common unit  respectively 
on june   we received  net of issuance costs  pursuant to the issuance of  common units to the public 
we used these proceeds to redeem  senior units  to pay the related accrued senior unit distribution and to pay related common unit issuance fees 
on april   we announced a series of transactions that increased the cash distribution coverage to our public common unitholders and modified the structure of our outstanding senior units 
in addition  we announced that an entity owned by our general partner s chairman  chief executive officer and president  james e 
ferrell  purchased all the outstanding senior units from the williams companies for a purchase price of  plus accrued and unpaid distributions 
we pay the senior units a quarterly cash distribution equivalent to percent per annum of the liquidating value 
we can redeem the senior units at any time  in whole or in part  upon payment in cash of the liquidating value of the senior units  currently per unit  plus the amount of any accrued and unpaid distributions 
the holder of the senior units has the right  subject to various events and conditions  to convert any outstanding senior units into common units at the earlier of december  or upon the occurrence of a material event as defined by our partnership agreement 
such conversion rights are contingent upon us not previously redeeming such securities 
also  ferrell companies granted us the option  until december   to defer future distributions on the common units held by it up to an aggregate outstanding amount of  as of july   we have not elected to defer any common unit distributions due ferrell companies 
our credit facility  which expires june   is an unsecured facility and consists of the following o a  working capital  general corporate and acquisition facility  including a letter of credit sub facility  and o a  revolving working capital facility  which is subject to an annual reduction in outstanding balances to zero for thirty consecutive days 
we intend to renew this facility before june   however  there are no assurances that the new facility will be renewed or on terms at least as favorable as the existing agreement 
all borrowings under the credit facility bear interest  at the borrower s option  at a rate equal to either london interbank offered rate plus an applicable margin  based upon our debt to cash flow ratio  varying from percent to percent or the bank s base rate plus an applicable margin varying from percent to percent 
the bank s base rates at july  and july  were and  respectively 
see investing activities for a discussion of additional cash availability related to the accounts receivable facility agreement 
at july    of letters of credit were outstanding under this credit facility 
letters of credit are currently used to cover obligations primarily relating to requirements for insurance coverage and  and to a lesser extent  risk management activities 
based on the pricing grid contained in the credit facility  the current borrowing rate for future borrowings under the credit facility is either the bank s base rate plus or libor plus 
effective july   the credit facility was amended to increase the letter of credit sub facility availability from  to  at july   we had a total of  of funding available under two facilities o  available for general corporate  acquisition and working capital purposes under the credit facility  and o  of funding available from the accounts receivable securitization facility 
we believe that the liquidity available from these facilities will be sufficient to meet our future working capital needs 
however  if we were to experience an unexpected significant increase in working capital requirements  this need could exceed our immediately available resources 
events that could cause increases in working capital borrowings or letter of credit requirements include  but are not limited to the following o a significant increase in the cost of propane  o a significant delay in the collections of accounts receivable  o increased volatility in energy commodity prices related to risk management activities  o increased liquidity requirements imposed by insurance providers  o a significant downgrade in our credit rating  or o decreased trade credit 
if one or more of these events caused a significant use of available funding  we would consider alternatives to provide increased working capital funding 
no assurances can be given  however  that such alternatives could be implemented 
in december  we entered into a  operating lease involving a portion of our customer tanks 
also in december  we assumed a  operating lease involving a portion of the thermogas acquisition related customer tanks 
both arrangements utilize a structure referred to as a synthetic operating lease  using a special purpose entity as lessor and ferrellgas  lp as lessee  thus  the assets and liabilities of the special purpose entities are not included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we made  of rent payments related to these leases for the most recent twelve month period 
both arrangements have terms that expire june   and may be extended for two additional one year periods at the option of ferrellgas  lp  if such extension is approved by the lessor 
prior to the end of the lease terms  we intend to secure additional financing in order to either lease or purchase the related customer tanks 
no assurances can be given that such financing will be obtained or  if obtained  such financing will be on terms equally favorable to us

however  there is no assurance that we will be successful in the future 
the large buyout amount in fiscal primarily relates to the previously discussed operating tank leases 
these two leases have terms that expire june   and may be extended for two additional one year periods at the option of ferrellgas  lp  if such extension is approved by the lessor 
we intend to secure additional financing in order to either lease or purchase the related tanks 
see note l to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding these leases 
at july   we had no borrowings outstanding on our credit facility 
we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of  used primarily to cover obligations relating to requirements for insurance coverage 
at july   we did not have any funding from our accounts receivable securitization facility 
as of july   in addition to the inventory on hand  we had committed to make delivery of approximately  gallons at a fixed price

pursuant to our partnership agreement  our general partner is entitled to reimbursement for all direct and indirect expenses incurred or payments it makes on our behalf  and all other necessary or appropriate expenses allocable to us or otherwise reasonably incurred by our general partner in connection with operating our business 
these costs  which totaled  for the year ended july   include compensation and benefits paid to officers and employees of our general partner who perform services on our behalf and general and administrative costs 
on december   we issued  common units to ferrell propane  inc  a subsidiary of our general partner in connection with our acquisition of blue flame bottle gas see note p to the consolidated financial statements 
the common unit issuance compensated ferrell propane for its retention of  of certain tax liabilities of blue flame 
during fiscal  we paid jef capital management  to redeem a total of  senior units and  in senior unit distributions 
in a noncash transaction  we accrued a senior unit distribution of  that we paid to jef capital management on september  ferrell international limited and fi trading  inc are beneficially owned by james e 
ferrell and thus are our affiliates 
we enter into transactions with ferrell international limited and fi trading in connection with our risk management activities and do so at market prices in accordance with our affiliate trading policy approved by our general partner s board of directors 
these transactions include forward  option and swap contracts and are all reviewed for compliance with the policy 
during fiscal  we recognized net receipts from purchases  sales and commodity derivative transactions of  these net purchases  sales and commodity derivative transactions with ferrell international limited and fi trading  inc are classified as cost of product sold 
amounts due from to ferrell international limited at july  were  and  respectively 
we believe these related party transactions were under terms that were no less favorable to us than those available with third parties

accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requirements include  among other things  that all business combinations be accounted for by a single method the purchase method 
it applies to all business combinations initiated after june  we have historically accounted for business combinations using the purchase method  therefore  this new standard will not have a substantial impact on how we account for future business combinations 
sfas no 
modifies the financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets  including the requirement that goodwill and some intangible assets no longer be amortized 
also some intangibles were reclassified to goodwill 
we adopted sfas no 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal although there was no cash flow effect  our amortization expense decreased by  in fiscal  compared to the amortization that would have been recorded had the new accounting standard not been issued 
this new standard also required us to test goodwill for impairment at the time the standard was adopted and also on an annual basis 
the results of these impairment tests did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we did not recognize any impairment losses as a result of these tests 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of a liability if a company has a legal or contractual financial obligation in connection with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset 
we will implement sfas no 
beginning in the fiscal year ending july   and expect to record a one time reduction to earnings during the first quarter of fiscal  as a cumulative change in accounting principle  of approximately  this charge relates to the estimated expenditures that will be incurred by us in the future primarily to close our underground storage facilities 
we believe the implementation will not have a material ongoing effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
sfas no 
modifies the financial accounting and reporting for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and it broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
we will implement sfas no

eliminates the requirement that material gains and losses resulting from the early extinguishment of debt be classified as an extraordinary item in the results of operations 
instead  companies must evaluate whether the transaction meets both the criteria of being unusual in nature and infrequent in occurrence 
other aspects of sfas no 
relating to accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers and accounting for lease modifications do not currently apply to us 
we will implement sfas no 
beginning in the fiscal year ending july   and believe the implementation will not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
sfas no 
modifies the financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this standard requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
additionally  the statement requires the liability to be recognized and measured initially at fair value 
under previous rules  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the entity s commitment to an exit plan 
we adopted and implemented sfas no 
for any exit or disposal activities that are initiated after july  we believe the implementation will not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
new federal legislation the public company accounting reform and investor protection act of was enacted by the united states congress on july  this act covers a wide variety of issues and its provisions will become effective at different times generally when implementing regulations become effective  at   or days after enactment depending on the specific provision 
it is important to note  however  that a number of the act s provisions became effective on july highlights of this legislation as it applies to us include o certification of the periodic reports by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer  o restrictions on insider trading of our partnership units and quicker reporting of insider trades in our partnership units  o prohibition of company loans to executives  o future periodic reports will contain an internal control assessment by management and the independent public accountants will attest to this assessment  o adoption of a code of ethics for senior financial officers  o the audit committee will establish procedures to handle complaints about accounting matters  including the confidential submission by employees  o independent public accountants are prohibited from providing certain non audit related activities to audit clients  o all audit and non audit services provided to the company by its independent public accountant will be pre approved by the audit committee  and o increased communication between the audit committee and the independent public accountants 
there are many other aspects of this act which will not directly apply to our company and other aspects which will have only a minor effect 
we will continue to review this act and forthcoming regulations as they are published 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our policies and estimates on an on going basis 
our consolidated financial statements may differ based upon different estimates and assumptions 
we discuss our significant accounting policies in note b to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies depreciation of property  plant and equipment we calculate depreciation using the straight line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from two to years 
changes in the estimated useful lives of our assets could have a material effect on results of operations 
amortization of intangible assets we calculate amortization using either straight line or accelerated methods over periods ranging from two to years 
we use amortization methods and determine asset values based on our best estimates using reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
changes in the amortization methods or asset values could have a material effect on results of operations 
fair value of derivative commodity contracts we enter into commodity forward  futures  swaps and options contracts involving propane and related products  which  in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  are not accounting hedges  but are used for risk management trading purposes 
to the extent such contracts are entered into at fixed prices and thereby subject us to market risk  the contracts are accounted for using the fair value method 
under this valuation method  derivatives are carried in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in value recognized in earnings 
we classify all gains and losses from these derivative contracts entered into for risk management trading purposes as cost of product sold in the consolidated statements of earnings 
we utilize published settlement prices for exchange traded contracts  quotes provided by brokers and estimates of market prices based on daily contract activity to estimate the fair value of these contracts 
changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these contracts could have a material effect on results of operations 
for further discussion of derivative commodity contracts  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations  liquidity and capital resources disclosures about risk management activities accounted for at fair value and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note j to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices 
our risk management trading activities utilize various types of energy commodity forward contracts  options  swaps traded on the over the counter financial markets and futures and options traded on the new york mercantile exchange to manage and hedge our exposure to the volatility of floating commodity prices and to protect our inventory positions 
we include the results from our risk management trading activities in our discussion and analysis of cost of product sold 
our other risk management activities  specifically our supply procurement activities  also utilize over the counter energy commodity forward contracts to limit overall price risk and options to hedge our exposure to inventory price movements 
we include the results from these other risk management activities in cost of product sold and in our discussion and analysis of retail margin per gallon 
market risks associated with energy commodities are monitored daily by senior management for compliance with our risk management policies 
these policies include specific dollar exposure limits  limits on the term of various contracts and volume limits for various energy commodities 
we also utilize loss limits and review our positions daily where we remain exposed to market risk  so as to manage exposures to changing market prices 
market  credit and liquidity risk 
new york mercantile exchange traded futures are guaranteed by the new york mercantile exchange and have nominal credit risk 
we are exposed to credit risk associated with forwards  swaps and option transactions in the event of nonperformance by counterparties 
for each counterparty  we analyze its financial condition prior to entering into an agreement  establish credit limits and monitor the appropriateness of each limit 
the change in market value of exchange traded futures contracts requires daily cash settlement in margin accounts with brokers 
forwards and most other over the counter instruments are generally settled at the expiration of the contract term 
in order to minimize the liquidity risk of cash  margin or collateral requirements of counterparties for over the counter instruments  we attempt to balance maturities and positions with individual counterparties 
historically  our risk management activities have not experienced significant credit related losses in any year or with any individual counterparty 
our risk management contracts do not contain material repayment provisions related to a decline in our credit rating 
sensitivity analysis 
we have prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate the exposure to market risk of our energy commodity positions 
forward contracts  futures  swaps and options used in our risk management trading activities were analyzed assuming a hypothetical adverse change in prices for the delivery month for all energy commodities 
the potential loss in future earnings regarding these positions from a adverse movement in market prices of the underlying energy commodities is estimated at  and  for risk management trading activities and  and  for other risk management activities as of july  and  respectively 
the preceding hypothetical analysis is limited because changes in prices may or may not equal  thus actual results may differ 
additionally  we seek to mitigate our variable rate interest rate risk exposure on operating leases by entering into interest rate cap agreements 
at july  and  we had  and  outstanding  respectively  in variable rate operating leases and an equal amount of interest rate cap agreements outstanding to hedge the related variable rate exposure 
thus  assuming a one percent increase in our variable interest rate  the interest rate risk related to the operating leases and the associated interest rate cap agreements would be a loss in future earnings of  and  in fiscal and  respectively
