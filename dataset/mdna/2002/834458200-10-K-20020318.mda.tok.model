equipment services the foundation for our unique value proposition has expanded to include equipment services as a complement to our equipment sourcing in response to our customers demand for both 
our ability to deliver a combined equipment and services solution  which supplements or replaces services that customers traditionally performed themselves  can enable the customers to focus on their core business strategies 
to date  our revenues from these services have not been significant 
we provide the following services in connection with our equipment sourcing 
equipment asset recovery services our customized asset recovery programs provide operators with effective solutions to manage their existing  surplus  or unwanted equipment assets 
these programs are customized to meet the specific objectives of each operator  and include direct equipment purchases as well as equipment trade ins  consignment and re marketing programs 
the programs allow operators to easily and rapidly recapture value from redeployed equipment 

equipment customization services our customization services include refurbishment and reconfiguration services providing quality  warranteed equipment that meet the requirements of today s network operators 
typically  the operator  another third party  or a somera trained professional removes the equipment from the network 
the refurbishment process is conducted by our in house technicians  whom we train  or by third parties  to conform to manufacturer specifications

equipment deployment services somera s intellectual capital in people and operations are uniquely qualified to provide installation and de installation services from the over different manufacturers represented 
trained technicians are dispatched to the location  where removal of the equipment is performed 
typically  the equipment redeployed from the site is shipped to our distribution and operations center for refurbishment and reconfiguration 

equipment diagnostic repair services to ensure the reliability of redeployed equipment we sell  many of our products are subjected to a rigorous testing and evaluation process 
the process includes loop back testing  field simulation testing  and self diagnostics 
we test equipment for procurement activities and customer orders prior to shipment 
we also perform repair services for customer owned equipment 
sales  marketing and procurement our sales organization is located primarily at our corporate headquarters in santa barbara  california and is augmented by our regional offices located in california  colorado  new jersey  georgia  kansas  washington  texas  and our international offices in amsterdam  the netherlands and singapore 
as of december   we employed over sales  services and procurement professionals 
we generate leads primarily through direct sales contact  telemarketing  direct marketing  customer referrals and participation in industry tradeshows 
our sales force is organized by market segment  including specialized teams focused on the regional bell operating companies rbocs  incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs  long distance carriers ixcs  competitive local exchange carriers clecs  wireless carriers  including cellular  personal communications service companies pcss and specialized mobile radio operators smrs  and internet service providers isps 
for our customers in the us and canada  our sales force operates on a named account basis rather than by geography  which allows us to maintain a consistent  single point of contact for each customer 
for our customer in all other countries  we approach the business more on a geographic basis due to language and country specific considerations 
another key feature of our selling effort is the relationships we establish at various levels in our customers organizations 
this structure allows us to establish multiple contacts with each customer across their management  engineering and purchasing operations 
for each type of operator  we employ dedicated teams with extensive market knowledge to meet the specific equipment needs of these customers 
each team member has access to  and is supported by  our relationship management database 
this real time proprietary information system allows each team to 
respond to customer requirements by accessing our proprietary global database of excess and redeployed equipment located at operators  manufacturers  distributors and other third parties worldwide  as well as by accessing our select inventory  
access relevant detailed purchase and sale information by customer and part number  
access technical and system configuration information  
trace and track all customer and vendor order activity  and 
project and anticipate customer equipment requirements 
each of our teams is headed by a group sales director who is responsible for the overall customer relationship and is supported by a number of group sales managers  account executives  and project managers to support logistics and production requirements 
we believe our dedicated team structure provides consistent high quality customer service which builds long term relationships with our customers 
our account executives have frequent customer contact and oversee customer proposals while our logistics administrators work with our production controllers as well as our customers to coordinate sourcing  delivery and any required follow through procedures to ensure our customers receive quality  timely customer service 
our marketing effort focuses on enhancing market awareness of our brand through industry trade shows  professional sales presentations and brochures  an informative web site  branded giveaways and special customer events 
additionally  we advertise in key telecommunications industry publications 
we believe the size and scope of our operations in our highly fragmented industry gives us both a unique advantage and opportunity to further build and enhance our brand recognition 
in support of our sales activities  we have teams who are responsible for procurement of the redeployed equipment we sell 
procurement teams are organized by market segment  including specialized teams focused on wireless operators  wireline operators  oems and distributors 
our procurement project managers are dedicated  on a named account basis  to purchase redeployed equipment from operators 
we also employ a product marketing group that develops and maintains our relationships with manufacturers and distributors to assure the availability of new equipment for our customers 
substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
as a result  we may commit resources to the procurement and testing of products without having received advance purchase commitments from customers 
we anticipate that our operating results for any given period will continue to be dependent  to a significant extent  on purchase orders 
these purchase orders can be delayed or canceled by our customers without penalty 
additionally  as telecommunications equipment supplier competition increases  we may need to lower our selling prices or pay more for the equipment we procure 
consequently  our gross margins may decrease over time 
we recognize revenue  net of estimated provision for sales returns and warranty obligations  when we ship equipment to our customers  provided that there are no significant post delivery obligations 
as we attempt to expand our sales  marketing and procurement efforts into international markets  we face a number of challenges  including 
recruiting skilled sales and technical support personnel  
creation of new supply and customer relationships  
difficulties and costs of managing and staffing international operations  and 
developing relationships with local suppliers 
any of these factors could potentially harm our future international operations 
customers we sell to every major segment of the telecommunications sector 
we sell equipment to ilecs  rbocs  ixcs  wireless operators including cellular  pcs  paging and smrs  and clecs 
we have a healthy account diversity with over  customers worldwide with the majority located in the united states 
in  verizon communications accounted for of our net revenue  with no other customers accounting for more than of our net revenue 
in  verizon communications accounted for of our net revenue 
in  no single customer accounted for more than of our net revenue 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for of our net revenue in  of our net revenue in  and of our net revenue in customers from whom we recognized at least million in net revenue in include leading operators such as verizon communications  alltel  western wireless and at t wireless 
competition the market for our equipment and service offerings is highly competitive 
we believe that the trends toward greater demand for telecommunications services  increasing global deregulation and rapid technology advancements characterized by shortened product lifecycles will continue to drive competition in our industry for the foreseeable future 
increased competition may result in price reductions  lower gross margins and loss of our market share 
increased competition in the secondary market for telecommunications equipment could also heighten demand for the limited supply of redeployed equipment  which would lead to increased prices for  and reduce the availability of  this equipment 
any increase in these prices could significantly impact our ability to maintain our gross margins 
any reduction in the availability of this equipment could cause us to lose customers 
the market for equipment deployment services is very fragmented 
we currently face competition primarily from oems  distributors and secondary market dealers 
many of these competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater resources and name recognition  and a larger base of customers 
these competitors are also likely to enjoy substantial competitive advantages over us  including the following 
ability to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their equipment and related services  
ability to adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can  
ability to expand existing customer relationships and more effectively develop new customer relationships than we can  including securing long term purchase agreements  
ability to leverage their customer relationships through volume purchasing contracts  and other means intended to discourage customers from purchasing products from us  
ability to more rapidly adopt new or emerging technologies and increase the array of products offered to better respond to changes in customer requirements  
greater focus and expertise on specific manufacturers or product lines  and 
ability to form new alliances or business combinations to rapidly acquire significant market share 
there can be no assurance that we will have the resources to compete successfully in the future or that competitive pressures will not harm our business 
employees as of december   we had full time employees 
we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory 
we have never had a work stoppage  and none of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract  integrate  retain and motivate highly qualified personnel  and upon the continued service of our senior management and key sales personnel 
demand for qualified personnel in the telecommunications equipment industry and our primary geographic locations is competitive 
we may not be successful in attracting  integrating  retaining and motivating a sufficient number of qualified employees to conduct our business in the future

corporate history we were organized as a limited liability company  or llc  and commenced operations in july in august  we entered into a million term loan facility and a million revolving loan facility with a syndicate of financial institutions led by fleet national bank 
in november  we raised approximately million in net proceeds from the initial public offering of  shares of our common stock 
approximately million of the proceeds were used to payoff the fleet national bank term loan and revolving loan facilities  including associated accrued interest 
the balance of the proceeds have been invested in short term  interest bearing  investment grade marketable securities 
business combinations 
in october  we acquired msi communications inc msi 
this acquisition has enabled somera to strengthen its product offering in data networking equipment and services  increase its national presence  and provide key personnel 
this transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
we paid million in cash  including acquisition costs and issued  shares of our common stock  which were held in escrow at december  in october  we completed the acquisition of the equipment repair business of asurent technologies  inc asurent for million in cash and acquisition costs 
the acquisition of asurent provides somera with enhanced equipment repair capabilities  key personnel  and additional customer and supplier relationships 
the financial results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the dates of acquisition 
for further details about these acquisitions  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations compared to net revenue 
substantially all of our net revenue consists of sales of new and redeployed telecommunications and data networking equipment  including switching  transmission  access  wireless  microwave and power products  net of estimated provision for returns 
net revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in net revenue was primarily attributable to a general increase in our equipment and services offerings rather than significant increases in the price of the products we sold  expansion of our international operations  and growth in significant customer accounts 
net revenues from customers outside of the united states increased to million in from million in due to the expansion of our international operations 
our acquisitions of msi in october and the equipment repair business of asurent in october contributed to the general increase in equipment and service offerings 
these increases were partially offset by the effects of the general slow down in the telecommunications operators capital spending levels  including increased price pressure on our redeployed equipment prices  caused by oems reduction of their equipment prices 
net revenue attributable to new equipment sales increased slightly to million in from million in net revenue attributable to redeployed equipment sales increased to million in from million in the increase in net revenue attributable to redeployed equipment sales was due to greater demand among our customers in connection with the build out and servicing of their existing networks 
we believe net revenue attributable to new and redeployed equipment will increase as our customers continue to build out their existing networks 
we believe net revenue from customers outside of the united states will increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of overall net revenue as we continue to expand our international operations 
cost of net revenue 
substantially all of our cost of net revenue consists of the costs of the equipment we purchase from third party sources 
cost of net revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in cost of net revenue during this period is primarily attributable to increases in our volume of redeployed equipment sales 
cost of net revenue attributable to new equipment sales decreased slightly to million in from million in cost of net revenue attributable to redeployed equipment sales increased to million in from million in the increase in cost of net revenue attributable to redeployed equipment was due primarily to increased volume of redeployed equipment sales 
we believe that the cost of net revenue attributable to redeployed equipment will continue to increase in absolute dollar terms as our volume of redeployed equipment sales increases in response to customer demand 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenue  or gross margin  decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to increased price pressure on redeployed equipment due to oems reduction of their equipment prices  as a result of the slow down of the economy in gross margin attributable to new equipment sales increased to in from in the increase in gross margin attributable to new equipment sales was primarily a function of equipment mix 
we believe gross margin attributable to new equipment sales will continue to fluctuate depending upon the mix of the new equipment we sell 
gross margin attributable to redeployed equipment sales decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin attributable to redeployed equipment sales was due primarily to increased price pressure on redeployed equipment 
we believe that gross margins attributable to redeployed equipment sales may continue to fluctuate depending upon the mix of redeployed equipment we sell  our ability to make significant discounted purchases  and the pace of recovery of the economy in general and the telecommunications industry  in particular 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and benefits for sales  marketing and procurement employees as well as costs associated with advertising  promotions and our e commerce initiative 
a majority of our sales and marketing expenses are incurred in connection with establishing and maintaining long term relationships with a variety of operators 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million  or of net revenue  in from million  or of net revenue  in this increase was primarily due to an increase of million in salaries and wages associated with the hiring of additional sales and procurement personnel  and an increase of  in travel related costs associated with our intensified sales efforts  partially offset by a decrease of million in lower absolute commissions corresponding to lower gross profit on which commissions are based 
the absolute increase in salaries and wages and decrease in commissions were also due to a change in compensation structure for our senior sales personnel  wherein base salaries were increased and commission rates were reduced 
we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our product and service offerings and increase our hiring of additional sales  services and procurement personnel  although such expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of net revenue 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of salary and benefit costs for executive and administrative personnel  professional fees and facility costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of net revenue  in from million  or of net revenue  in this increase was due primarily to an increase of million in compensation costs and benefits associated with the increase in employees relating to the expansion of our operations  an increase of million associated with facilities costs and an increase of million in depreciation 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in the future as we expand our operations  although such expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of net revenue 
reorganization charges 
on march   in light of the economic environment and the state of the telecommunications industry  we undertook a reorganization in which the domestic workforce was reduced by people  or approximately of the then existing workforce 
the terminations were not concentrated in any particular aspect of the business 
we recorded total associated charges of  representing accrued salaries and wages  severance  accrued vacation  payroll taxes and other directly related costs  all of which were paid during amortization of intangible assets 
intangible assets consist of acquired workforce  customer contract and goodwill related to our acquisitions during and which were amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives 
amortization of intangible assets increased to million in from  in this increase in reflects a full year of amortization of the goodwill and purchased intangibles arising from the msi acquisition compared with three months of amortization in we expect amortization of intangible assets to decrease in the future upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net consists of investment earnings on cash and cash equivalent balances 
interest income  net decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates in effect during we had no long term debt outstanding as of december  income tax provision 
income tax provision decreased to million in  an effective tax rate of  from million in  an effective tax rate of 
compared to net revenue 
net revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in net revenue was driven primarily by greater overall customer demand for our equipment rather than significant increases in the price of the products we sold  our expansion in united states markets and growth in significant customer accounts 
net revenue attributable to new equipment sales increased to million in from million in the increase in net revenue attributable to new equipment sales was due to greater customer demand for new telecommunications equipment and our offering a broader variety of new equipment to customers 
net revenue attributable to redeployed equipment sales increased to million in from million in the increase in net revenue attributable to redeployed equipment sales was due to greater demand among our customers in connection with the build out and servicing of their existing networks 
cost of net revenue 
cost of net revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in cost of net revenue during this period is primarily attributable to increases in our volume of new and redeployed equipment sales 
cost of net revenue attributable to new equipment sales increased to million in from million in the increase in cost of net revenue attributable to new equipment was due primarily to increases in the volume of new equipment we sold rather than increased unit costs of equipment we purchased 
cost of net revenue attributable to redeployed equipment sales increased to million in from million in the increase in cost of net revenue attributable to redeployed equipment was due primarily to increased volume of redeployed equipment sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenue  or gross margin  increased to in from in the increase in gross margins was primarily due to more favorable prices obtained from our suppliers due in part to our increased volume of purchases and opportunistic buys  offset by an increase in the proportion of new equipment we sold  which generally has lower gross margins than redeployed equipment 
gross margin attributable to new equipment sales increased to in from in the increase in gross margin attributable to new equipment sales was due primarily to our ability to leverage the increased volume of purchases in negotiating more favorable pricing from our suppliers 
gross margin attributable to redeployed equipment sales increased to in from in the increase in gross margin attributable to redeployed equipment sales was due primarily to our opportunistic purchases of redeployed equipment in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million  or of net revenue  in from million  or of net revenue  in this increase was due to higher absolute commission expenses consistent with increased gross profit  hiring of additional sales and procurement personnel  intensified marketing and advertising activities and costs associated with our e commerce initiative 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of net revenue  in from million  or of net revenue  in this increase was due primarily to the increase in employees relating to the expansion of our operations and associated facilities costs

amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges total operating expenses income from operations interest income expense  net income before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income historically  prior to  our net revenue and gross profit had increased in each quarter compared to the same quarter in the previous year due primarily to increased levels of customer demand for the equipment we sell in general 
however  due primarily to the general slow down in the economy in  net revenue for the third and fourth quarters did not exceed the amounts in comparable quarters in  and gross profit was generally lower than the year earlier quarters 
our gross margin worsened in versus primarily due to increased price pressure from oems 
sales and marketing expenses have increased in absolute dollars in almost every quarter reflecting greater commissions paid on increased gross profit  the addition of sales personnel and intensified marketing efforts 
general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollar terms in almost every quarter due to the increase in personnel and facilities costs and professional fees required to support our growth 
historically  our net revenue and results of operations have been subject to significant fluctuations  particularly on a quarterly basis  and could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year in the future 
causes of such fluctuations may include the rate and timing of customers orders for the equipment we sell  the rate at which telecommunications operators redeploy equipment  decreases in the prices of the equipment we sell due to increased secondary market competition  our ability to locate and obtain equipment  our ability to deploy equipment on a timely basis  seasonal variations in customer purchasing  write offs due to inventory defects and obsolescence  the potentially long sales cycle for our equipment  delays in the commencement of operations in new markets  costs relating to possible acquisitions  and general economic conditions and conditions specific to the telecommunications industry 
significant quarterly fluctuations in our net revenue will cause significant fluctuations in our cash flows and working capital 
liquidity and capital resources since inception in july  we have financed our operations primarily through cash flows from operations 
net cash generated by operating activities in was million  comprised of net income of million  noncash expenses of million and a decrease in operating assets and liabilities of million 
net cash used in operating activities in was million  comprised of net income of million  noncash expenses of million and an increase in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the increase in operating assets and liabilities in is primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of million and our strategic investment in inventory  resulting in an increase in inventory of million 
net cash generated by operating activities was million in through november  substantially all of the cash generated by operating activities was distributed to the members of somera communications  llc  our predecessor entity 
net cash used in investing activities in comprised primarily our acquisition of asurent for million in cash  including acquisition costs  and acquisition of property and equipment of million 
net cash used in investing activities in comprised primarily our acquisition of msi for million in cash  including acquisition costs  and acquisition of property and equipment of million 
net cash used in investing activities in comprised primarily loans to officers of million and acquisition of property and equipment of  on august   we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions led by fleet national bank 
the credit agreement provided for a term loan facility and a revolving loan facility 
the term loan facility was for an aggregate principal amount of million 
the revolving loan facility allowed us to borrow million  with a million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit 
the obligations under the term loan facility and the revolving loan facility were secured by a first priority lien on all our tangible and intangible assets 
the proceeds of our term loan facility were used to make a distribution to the members of somera communications  llc of million in september and the remaining million was used to pay off a portion of outstanding balances on notes payable 
additionally  approximately million of our revolving loan facility was used to pay off the current portion of the notes payable 
the remaining amount of notes payable  approximately  was satisfied from available cash 
on november   we sold  shares of our common stock at per share through an initial public offering  raising approximately million in net proceeds 
in november  we repaid and retired the outstanding balance of the term loan facility and the outstanding balance of the revolving loan facility with the proceeds of the offering 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
we do not currently plan to pay dividends  but rather to retain earnings for use in the operation of our business and to fund future growth 
we had no long term debt outstanding as of december  the following summarizes the our contractual obligations under various operating leases for both office and warehouse space as at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
the remaining lease terms range in length from one to four years with future minimum lease payments  net of sublease proceeds of  in and  in  as follows in thousands operating leases total minimum lease payments  we are also exposed to credit risk in the event of default of the sublessee  because we are still liable to meet our obligations under the terms of the original lease agreement 
we anticipate significant increases in working capital in the future primarily as a result of increased sales of equipment and higher relative levels of inventory 
we will also continue to expend significant amounts of capital on property and equipment related to the expansion of our corporate headquarters  distribution centers  equipment testing infrastructure  and additional facilities to support our growth  as well as expending significant resources in support of our business to business e commerce activities and other information technology projects 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  valuation allowances  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  and income taxes to be critical policies 
revenue recognition 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from the sale of products 
revenue is recognized upon our delivery of product provided that  at the time of delivery  there is evidence of a contractual arrangement with the customer  the fee is fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and there are no significant remaining obligations 
delivery occurs when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  generally at the time the product is shipped to the customer 
we also generate some services revenue in connection with equipment sales 
revenue for transactions that include multiple elements such as equipment and services is allocated to each element based on its relative fair value or in the absence of fair value  the residual method and recognized when the revenue recognition criteria have been met for each element 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the following criteria are satisfied undelivered elements are not essential to the functionality of delivered elements  uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved  and the fair value for all undelivered elements is known 
through revenue from services represented less than of total revenue 
revenue is deferred when customer acceptance is uncertain  when significant obligations remain  or when undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered products 
a reserve for sales returns and warranty obligations is recorded at the time of shipment and is based on our historical experience 
actual results could differ from those estimates  which could affect our operating results 
at december   the reserve for sales returns and warranty obligations was million 
valuation allowances 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
specifically  we make estimates of doubtful accounts and slow moving and obsolete inventory 
at december   the estimates for doubtful accounts and slow moving and obsolete inventory were million and million  respectively 
these estimates are made based on a consideration of various factors  including historical experience  knowledge of customers and the telecommunications equipment market  and current economic trends 
actual results could differ from those estimates  which could affect our operating results 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
see further discussion under recent accounting pronouncements below 
at december   we determined that our identifiable intangibles and goodwill were appropriately recorded and that there was no loss impairment 
deferred taxes 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assess the need for additional valuation allowances related to our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had no valuation allowances recorded against our deferred tax assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
sfas business combinations and sfas no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires business combinations initiated after june   to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separately from goodwill 
recorded goodwill and intangibles will be evaluated against these new criteria and may result in certain intangibles being subsumed into goodwill  or alternatively  amounts initially recorded as goodwill may be separately identified and recognized apart from goodwill 
sfas requires the use of a non amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles 
under a non amortization approach  goodwill and certain intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead would be reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its fair value 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
on january  in the year ended december   we recorded approximately million of amortization expense on goodwill and acquired workforce which would not have been recognized if this standard were in effect for the current year 
for business combinations initiated after june   we will follow the non amortization method under sfas in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas addresses significant issues relating to the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and develops a single accounting method under which long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale are measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell 
additionally  sfas expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and its provisions are to be applied prospectively 
we are currently assessing the impact of sfas on our financial position and results of operations 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business could be harmed and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
you should also refer to other information contained in this annual report on form k  including our financial statements and related notes 
our operating results are likely to fluctuate in future periods  which might lead to reduced prices for our stock 
our annual or quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of numerous factors  many of which are outside of our control 
if our annual quarterly operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the trading price of our stock could significantly decline 
factors that could impact our operating results include 
the rate  timing and volume of orders for the telecommunications infrastructure equipment we sell  
the rate at which telecommunications operators de install their equipment  
decreases in our selling prices due to competition in the secondary market or price pressure from oems  
our ability to obtain products cost effectively from oems  distributors  operators and other secondary sources of telecommunications equipment  
our ability to provide equipment and service offerings on a timely basis to satisfy customer demand  
variations in customer capital spending patterns due to seasonality  economic conditions for telecommunications operators and other factors  
write offs due to inventory defects or obsolescence  
the sales cycle for equipment we sell  which can be relatively lengthy  
delays in the commencement of our operations in new market segments and geographic regions  and 
costs relating to possible acquisitions and integration of new businesses 
our business depends upon our ability to match third party redeployed equipment supply with carrier demand for this equipment and failure to do so could reduce our net revenue 
our success depends on our continued ability to match the equipment needs of telecommunications operators with the supply of redeployed equipment available in the secondary market 
we depend upon maintaining business relationships with third parties who can provide us with redeployed equipment and information on available redeployed equipment 
failure to effectively manage these relationships and match the needs of our customers with available supply of redeployed equipment could damage our ability to generate net revenue 
in the event operators decrease the rate at which they de install their networks  or choose not to de install their networks at all  it would be more difficult for us to locate this equipment  which could negatively impact our net revenue 
a downturn in the telecommunications industry or an industry trend toward reducing or delaying additional equipment purchases due to cost cutting pressures could reduce demand for our products 
we rely significantly upon customers concentrated in the telecommunications industry as a source of net revenue and redeployed equipment inventory 
in  we experienced a general downturn in the level of capital spending by our telecommunications customers 
this slow down in capital in capital spending could result in reduced sales to our customers and postponement of network upgrades 
there can be no assurance that the level of capital spending in the telecommunications industry or by our customers specifically will increase or remain at current levels 
lower capital spending could result in reduced sales to our customers  and could impair our ability to obtain redeployed telecommunications equipment 
the market for supplying equipment to telecommunications operators is competitive  and if we cannot compete effectively  our net revenue and gross margins might decline 
competition among companies who supply equipment to telecommunications operators is intense 
we currently face competition primarily from three sources oems  distributors and secondary market dealers who sell new and redeployed telecommunications infrastructure equipment 
if we are unable to compete effectively against our current or future competitors  we may have to lower our selling prices and may experience reduced gross margins and loss of market share  either of which could harm our business 
competition is likely to increase as new companies enter this market  as current competitors expand their products and services or as our competitors consolidate 
increased competition in the secondary market for telecommunications equipment could also heighten demand for the limited supply of redeployed equipment which would lead to increased prices for  and reduce the availability of  this equipment 
any increase in these prices could significantly impact our ability to maintain our gross margins 
we do not have many formal relationships with suppliers of telecommunications equipment and may not have access to adequate product supply 
in fiscal year  of our net revenue was generated from the sale of redeployed telecommunications equipment 
typically  we do not have supply contracts to obtain this equipment and are dependent on the de installation of equipment by operators to provide us with much of the equipment we sell 
our ability to buy redeployed equipment from operators is dependent on our relationships with them 
if we fail to develop and maintain these business relationships with operators or they are unwilling to sell redeployed equipment to us  our ability to sell redeployed equipment will suffer 
our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our key customers would have a negative impact on our net revenue 
historically  a significant portion of our sales have been to relatively few customers 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for of our net revenue in  of our net revenue in  and in verizon communications accounted for and of our net revenue in and  respectively 
in  no single customer accounted for over of our net revenue 
in addition  substantially all of our sales are made on a purchase order basis  and no customer has entered into a long term purchasing agreement with us 
as a result  we cannot be certain that our current customers will continue to purchase from us 
the loss of  or any reduction in orders from  a significant customer would have a negative impact on our net revenue 
we may be forced to reduce the sales prices for the equipment we sell  which may impair our ability to maintain our gross margins 
in the future we expect to reduce prices in response to competition and to generate increased sales volume 
in some manufacturers reduced their prices of new telecommunications equipment 
if manufacturers reduce the prices of new telecommunications equipment  we may be required to further reduce the price of the new and redeployed equipment we sell 
if we are forced to reduce our prices or are unable to shift the sales mix towards higher margin equipment sales  we will not be able to maintain current gross margins 
the market for redeployed telecommunications equipment is relatively new and it is unclear whether our equipment and service offerings and our business will achieve long term market acceptance 
the market for redeployed telecommunications equipment is relatively new and evolving  and we are not certain that our potential customers will adopt and deploy redeployed telecommunications equipment in their networks 
for example  with respect to redeployed equipment that includes a significant software component  potential customers may be unable to obtain a license or sublicense for the software 
even if they do purchase redeployed equipment  our potential customers may not choose to purchase redeployed equipment from us for a variety of reasons 
our customers may also re deploy their displaced equipment within their own networks which would eliminate their need for our equipment and service offerings 
these internal solutions would also limit the supply of redeployed equipment available for us to purchase  which would limit the development of this market 
we may fail to continue to attract  develop and retain key management and sales personnel  which could negatively impact our operating results 
we depend on the performance of our executive officers and other key employees 
the loss of any member of our senior management or other key employees could negatively impact our operating results and our ability to execute our business strategy 
in addition  we depend on our sales professionals to serve customers in each of our markets 
the loss of any of our sales professionals could significantly disrupt our relationships with our customers 
we do not have key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
our future success also depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
competition for employees in the telecommunications equipment industry is intense 
additionally  we depend on our ability to train and develop skilled sales people and an inability to do so would significantly harm our growth prospects and operating performance 
we have experienced  and we expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees 
our business may suffer if we are not successful in our efforts to keep up with a rapidly changing market 
the market for the equipment and services we sell is characterized by technological changes  evolving industry standards  changing customer needs and frequent new equipment and service introductions 
our future success in addressing the needs of our customers will depend  in part  on our ability to timely and cost effectively 
respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes  
develop our internal technical capabilities and expertise  
broaden our equipment and service offerings  and 
adapt our services to new technologies as they emerge 
our failure in any of these areas could harm our business 
moreover  any increased emphasis on software solutions as opposed to equipment solutions could limit the availability of redeployed equipment  decrease customer demand for the equipment we sell  or cause the equipment we sell to become obsolete 
the lifecycles of telecommunications infrastructure equipment may become shorter  which would decrease the supply of  and carrier demand for  redeployed equipment 
our sales of redeployed equipment depend upon telecommunications operator utilization of existing telecommunications network technology 
if the lifecycle of equipment comprising operator networks is significantly shortened for any reason  including technology advancements  the installed base of any particular model would be limited 
this limited installed base would reduce the supply of  and demand for  redeployed equipment which could decrease our net revenue 
many of our customers are telecommunications operators that may at any time reduce or discontinue their purchases of the equipment we sell to them 
if our customers choose to defer or curtail their capital spending programs  it could have a negative impact on our sales to those telecommunications operators  which would harm our business 
a significant portion of our customers are emerging telecommunications operators who compete against existing telephone companies 
these new participants only recently began to enter these markets  and many of these operators are still building their networks and rolling out their services 
they require substantial capital for the development  construction and expansion of their networks and the introduction of their services 
if emerging operators fail to acquire and retain customers or are unsuccessful in raising needed funds or responding to any other trends  such as price reductions for their services or diminished demand for telecommunications services in general  then they could be forced to reduce their capital spending programs 
if we fail to implement our strategy of purchasing equipment from and selling equipment to regional bell operating companies  our growth will suffer 
one of our strategies is to develop and expand our relationships with regional bell operating companies  or rbocs 
we believe the rbocs could provide us with a significant source of additional net revenue 
in addition  we believe the rbocs could provide us with a large supply of redeployed equipment 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in implementing this strategy 
rbocs may not choose to sell redeployed equipment to us or may not elect to purchase this equipment from us 
rbocs may instead develop those capabilities internally or elect to compete with us and resell redeployed equipment to our customers or prospective customers 
if we fail to successfully develop our relationships with rbocs or if rbocs elect to compete with us  our growth could suffer 
if we do not expand our international operations our growth could suffer 
we intend to continue expanding our business in international markets 
this expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources to develop a successful international business  including sales  procurement and support channels 
following this strategy  we opened our european headquarters in the fourth quarter of  hired a vice president to oversee our international operations in the first quarter of and a regional sales director for asia in the second quarter of however  we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for the equipment we sell  and therefore we might not be able to expand our international operations 
we currently have limited experience providing equipment outside the united states 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for of our net revenue in  of our net revenue in  and of our net revenue in we may fail to engage in selective acquisitions which could limit our future growth 
one of our strategies for growth is to engage in selective acquisitions 
our ability to conduct such acquisitions may be limited by our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates and obtain necessary financing 
if we are unable to identify and take advantage of these opportunities  our future growth could be limited 
if we do engage in selective acquisitions  we may experience difficulty assimilating the operations or personnel of the acquired companies  which could threaten our future growth 
if we make acquisitions in the future  we could have difficulty assimilating or retaining the acquired companies personnel or integrating their operations  equipment or services into our organization 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
moreover  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs  impairment of goodwill  or amortization of acquired other intangible assets 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities in any future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities would be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
failure to manage our rapid growth effectively could harm our results of operations 
since we began commercial operations in july  we have experienced rapid growth and expansion that is straining our resources 
continued growth could place a further strain on our management  operational and financial resources 
our inability to manage growth effectively could harm our business 
our current or planned operational systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
delays in the implementation of new systems or operational disruptions when we transition to new systems would impair our ability to accurately forecast sales demand  manage our equipment inventory and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 
defects in the equipment we sell may seriously harm our credibility and our business 
telecommunications operators require a strict level of quality and reliability from telecommunications equipment suppliers 
telecommunications equipment is inherently complex and can contain undetected software or hardware errors 
if we deliver telecommunications equipment with undetected material defects  our reputation  credibility and equipment sales could suffer 
moreover  because the equipment we sell is integrated into our customers networks  it can be difficult to identify the source of a problem should one occur 
the occurrence of such defects  errors or failures could also result in delays in installation  product returns  product liability and warranty claims and other losses to us or our customers 
in some of our contracts  we have agreed to indemnify our customers against liabilities arising from defects in the equipment we sell to them 
furthermore  we supply most of our customers with guarantees that cover the equipment we offer 
while we may carry insurance policies covering these possible liabilities  these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted 
a material product liability claim  whether successful or not  could be costly  damage our reputation and distract key personnel  any of which could harm our business 
our strategy to outsource services could impair our ability to deliver our equipment on a timely basis 
while we have expanded our services capability  we still currently depend on  to a large degree  third parties for a variety of equipment related services  including engineering  repair  transportation  testing  installation and de installation 
this outsourcing strategy involves risks to our business  including reduced control over delivery schedules  quality and costs and the potential absence of adequate capacity 
in the event that any significant subcontractor were to become unable or unwilling to continue to perform their required services  we would have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements 
this process could be lengthy  and we cannot be sure that additional sources of third party services would be available to us on a timely basis  or at all 
our quarterly net revenue and the price of our stock may be negatively impacted by the seasonal purchasing patterns of our customers 
our quarterly net revenue may be subject to the seasonal purchasing patterns of our customers  which may occur as a result of our customers annual budgetary  procurement and sales cycles 
if our quarterly net revenue fails to meet the expectations of analysts due to those seasonal fluctuations  the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected 
our ability to meet customer demand and the growth of our net revenue could be harmed if we are unable to manage our inventory needs accurately 
to meet customer demand in the future  we believe it is necessary to maintain or increase some levels of inventory 
failure to maintain adequate inventory levels in these products could hurt our ability to make sales to our customers 
in the past  we have experienced inventory shortfalls  and we cannot be certain that we will not experience shortfalls again in the future  which could harm our reputation and our business 
further  rapid technology advancement could make our existing inventory obsolete and cause us to incur losses 
in addition  if our forecasts lead to an accumulation of inventories that are not sold in a timely manner  our business could suffer 
the corruption or interruption of key software systems we use could cause our business to suffer if it delays or restricts our ability to meet our customers needs 
we rely on the integrity of key software and systems 
specifically we rely on our relationship management database which tracks information on currently or potentially available redeployed equipment 
this software and these systems may be vulnerable to harmful applications  computer viruses and other forms of corruption and interruption 
in the event our software or systems are affected by any form of corruption or interruption  it could delay or restrict our ability to meet our customers needs  which could harm our reputation or business 
if we are unable to meet our additional capital needs in the future  we may not be able to execute our business growth strategy 
we currently anticipate that our available cash resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
however  our resources may not be sufficient to satisfy these requirements 
we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings to 
take advantage of business opportunities  including more rapid international expansion or acquisitions of complementary businesses  
develop and maintain higher inventory levels  
gain access to new product lines  
develop new services  or 
respond to competitive pressures 
any additional financing we may need might not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our business could suffer if the inability to raise this funding threatens our ability to execute our business growth strategy 
moreover  if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of ownership of our current stockholders will be reduced 
newly issued equity securities may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of investors in our common stock 
in addition  the terms of any debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
we face the risk of future non recurring charges in the event of impairment 
we adopted sfas beginning in january and  as a result  we no longer amortize goodwill 
however  we will continue to have amortization related to other purchased intangibles  and we must evaluate our intangible assets  including goodwill  at least annually for impairment 
for  our amortization charge for other intangibles was  and our amortization charge for goodwill was million 
if we determine that these items are impaired  we will be required to take a related non recurring charge to earnings 
our facilities could be vulnerable to damage from earthquakes and other natural disasters 
our main facilities are located on or near known earthquake fault zones and are vulnerable to damage from fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures and similar events 
if a disaster occurs  our ability to test and ship the equipment we sell would be seriously  if not completely  impaired  and our inventory could be damaged or destroyed  which would seriously harm our business 
we cannot be sure that the insurance we maintain against fires  floods  earthquakes and general business interruptions will be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case 
our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us  and may make future business decisions with which some of our stockholders might disagree 
our executive officers  directors and entities affiliated with them beneficially own an aggregate of approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  as a result  these stockholders will be able to exercise substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk we have reviewed the provisions of financial reporting release no 
disclosure of accounting policies for derivative commodity instruments and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risks inherent in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
we had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at december  substantially all of our revenue and capital spending is denominated in us dollars 
we invest our excess cash in short term  interest bearing  investment grade marketable securities 
due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity  these instruments are classified as cash equivalents and do not represent a material interest rate risk 
as of december   we had no long term debt outstanding
