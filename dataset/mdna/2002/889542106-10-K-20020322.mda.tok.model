item business 
the company was incorporated in pennsylvania in and began operations in its principal offices are located at nixon road  cheswick  pennsylvania and its telephone number is the company designs  engineers  markets and supports test system  test access and status monitoring products for the telecommunications and cable television industries 
the company s telecommunications proprietary test access products enable telephone companies to use their existing line test systems to remotely diagnose problems in plain old telephone service pots lines containing both copper and fiber optics 
pots lines comprise the vast majority of lines in service today throughout the world 
in addition to traditional voice service  pots includes lines for popular devices such as computer modems and fax machines 
pots excludes the more complex lines  such as data communications service lines  commonly referred to as special services 
in general  pots line test systems  which are located at telephone companies central offices  focus on helping local exchange carriers conduct the full range of fault diagnosis in the local loop  which is the portion of the telephone network which connects end users to a telephone company s central office 
in addition  these line test systems have the ability to remotely qualify  deploy and maintain next generation services that include digital subscriber line dsl service and integrated services digital network isdn service 
these test systems reduce the time needed to identify and resolve problems and eliminate or reduce the cost of dispatching a technician to the problem site 
most pots line test systems were designed for use over copper wireline only  so that the introduction of fiber optic technology into the local loop renders it inaccessible to these test systems 
the company s mcu r products solve this problem by extending test system access through the fiber optic portion into the copper portion of the local loop
