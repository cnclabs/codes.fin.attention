item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations and financial condition we are a leading developer and manufacturer of power sources  feedthroughs and wet tantalum capacitors used in implantable medical devices 
we also develop and manufacture other precision engineered components used in implantable medical devices 
we leverage our core competencies in technology and manufacturing to develop and produce power sources for commercial applications that demand high performance and reliability 
these applications include aerospace  oil and gas exploration and oceanographic equipment 
in june  we acquired substantially all of the assets of the sierra kd components division of maxwell technologies  inc greatbatch sierra  a developer and manufacturer of electromagnetic interference filters and capacitors primarily for implantable medical devices  for million in cash and certain assumed liabilities 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill 
in july  we completed a stock offering of million shares of common stock  comprised of million shares sold by existing shareholders and million newly issued shares 
the company received million in net proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions and debt reduction 
we derive revenues from the sale of medical and commercial products 
our medical revenues consist of sales of implantable power sources  capacitors and components 
our commercial revenues consist of sales of commercial power sources 
our implantable power source revenues are derived from sales of batteries for pacemakers  implantable cardioverter defibrillators icds and other implantable medical devices 
we also record royalties as implantable power source revenues for licenses we have granted to others for the manufacture of batteries using designs and processes patented by us 
our capacitor revenues are derived from sales of our wet tantalum capacitors  which we developed for use in icds 
our component revenues are derived from sales of feedthroughs  electrodes  electromagnetic interference emi filters and other precision components principally used in pacemakers and icds 
we also sell our components for use in other implantable medical devices 
our commercial power sources revenues are derived primarily from sales of batteries for use in oil and gas exploration 
we also supply batteries to nasa for its space shuttle program and other similarly demanding commercial applications 
a substantial part of our business is conducted with a limited number of customers 
our two largest customers accounted for approximately of revenues in we have entered into long term supply agreements with most of our large customers 
for each of our products  we recognize revenue when the products are shipped and title passes 
we do not give warranties to our customers for our products and to date  returns have been immaterial 
cost of goods sold includes materials  labor and other manufacturing costs associated with the products we sell 
selling  general  and administrative expenses include salaries  facility costs  professional service fees  and patent related and other legal expenses 
research  development  and engineering costs include expenses associated with the design  development  testing  deployment and enhancement of our products 
we record cost reimbursements received for research  development and engineering conducted on behalf of customers as an offset to research  development and engineering expenses 
our fiscal year ends on the closest friday to december accordingly  our fiscal year will periodically contain more or less than days 
for example  fiscal ended on december   fiscal ended december  and fiscal ended on december  our fiscal quarters are three month periods that end on the friday closest to the end of the applicable calendar quarter 
the commentary that follows should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
fiscal compared with fiscal revenues total revenues for were million  a million  or  increase from million for medical 
total medical revenues for were million  a million  or  increase from million for implantable power source revenues for were million  a million  or  increase from million for this increase was primarily due to higher demand for our icd batteries from our customers  both foreign and domestic 
this increase was partially offset due to the expiration of implantable power source patents in on which we had been receiving royalty fees 
capacitor revenues for were million  a million or increase from million for this increase was primarily due to market acceptance and demand for the icds using our capacitor  which was first introduced in the fourth quarter of medical component revenues for were million  a million  or  increase from million for this increase was primarily due to the acquisition of greatbatch sierra in june  whose primary product line of emi filters for implantable devices complements our other component lines well 
commercial 
commercial power sources revenues increased to million compared to million for the higher revenues were primarily related to the inclusion of revenues for a full year from our battery engineering  inc bei acquisition that was completed in august this acquisition  combined with our pre existing commercial business  allowed us to participate strongly in the increased demand for products used in oil and gas exploration activity  which was up sharply in gross profit gross profit for was million  an million  or  increase from million for as a percentage of total revenues  gross profit for improved to from for this increase was primarily due to increased efficiencies and cost leveraging based on the higher production volumes in over in addition  the absence in of significant start up costs that accompanied the ramp up of capacitors to production volumes in further aided the comparison 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for were million  a million  or  increase from million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due to the inclusion of such expenses from greatbatch sierra since its acquisition in june  a full year of expenses from bei in versus only five months in  a full year of public company expenses annual stock listing and registrar fees  investor relation expenses  etc  and increased training costs in support of our adoption of a six sigma quality initiative 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were and in and  respectively 
research  development and engineering expenses research  development and engineering costs for were million  a million  or  increase from million in payments received from customers for the development of proprietary products are recorded as an offset to research  development and engineering costs 
such payments totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in net costs reflects our acquisitions of greatbatch sierra and bei as discussed above  as well as our ongoing commitment to invest in the development of new products and enhancing the performance of our existing products 
as a percentage of total revenues  research  development and engineering costs before development payments received from customers were in  as compared to in this decrease was primarily due to the rapid growth in capacitor and commercial revenues in  and not to any decrease in our research and development initiatives 
other operating expenses intangible amortization was million for  an increase of million  or from million in this increase primarily reflects the amortization of intangible assets that were recorded as part of our acquisition of greatbatch sierra 
net interest expense for was million  a decrease of million  or  from million for gross interest expense in was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in proceeds from our fall initial public offering were used to prepay million of our senior debt in october the remaining debt was refinanced during the first quarter of at more favorable terms 
an additional million was borrowed in june to finance our acquisition of greatbatch sierra 
net interest expense included interest income of million in  an increase of million  or from interest income of million in this increase reflected incremental income earned on the investment of proceeds from our secondary stock offering in july other expense of million in compares with other income of million in losses on disposition of assets and additions to our allowance for doubtful accounts comprise the majority of the balance in these recurring items were offset in  when we sold  for a gain  interest rate cap agreements which were no longer needed due to the prepayment of our senior debt 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate decreased slightly to for from for our rate includes the effect of all state taxes and available credits 
extraordinary charge as discussed above  the senior debt and subordinated debt that remained outstanding at year end was refinanced in the first quarter this transaction resulted in an extraordinary charge  net of tax  of million 
the charge related to the call premium and write off of fees and other expenses incurred to establish the original debt financing 
the extraordinary charge  net of tax  recorded in as a result of that year s prepayment of debt with proceeds from our initial public offering totaled million 
net income our net income for amounted to million  up from a net loss of million in this improvement was primarily due to the decrease in interest expense and the increase in gross profit 
the net earnings per share was for  assuming dilution  as compared with a loss per share of for fiscal compared to fiscal revenues total revenues for were million  an million  or  increase from million for the growth in revenues was primarily due to sales of our line of wet tantalum capacitors  which were launched commercially in the fourth quarter of  and the inclusion of revenues from bei since its acquisition in august medical 
total medical revenues for were million  a million  or  increase from million for implantable power source revenues for were million  a million  or  increase from million for this increase was primarily due to higher pacemaker battery sales as a result of an increase in pacemaker device sales by our customers  both foreign and domestic 
this increase was partially offset due to an industry wide design change in icds that resulted in icds using one battery instead of two 
this conversion began in mid and was substantially complete by the third quarter of capacitor revenues for were million  a million increase from million for this increase was primarily due to initial commercial sales of our new wet tantalum capacitors beginning in the fourth quarter of medical components revenues for were million  a million  or  increase from million for this increase was primarily due to the sale of a greater number of implantable medical devices by our customers  as well as our sales of a broader range of components in when compared with commercial 
commercial power sources revenues increased to million compared to million for the higher revenues were primarily related to the inclusion of revenues from the bei acquisition that was completed in august gross profit gross profit for was million  a million  or  increase from million for as a percentage of total revenues  gross profit for declined to from for this decrease was primarily due to a lower percentage of total revenues from established product lines such as implantable power sources  with no accompanying start up costs  versus a higher percentage of total revenues from newer products  with accompanying high start up costs  such as capacitors 
in addition  sales of lower margin products  such as medical components and commercial power sources  have increased at a faster rate than have sales of historically higher margin implantable power sources 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for were million  a million  or  increase from million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the inclusion of such expenses from bei since its acquisition in august  wage increases in as compared to wage decreases in and the accrual of incentive compensation in whereas there were no such accruals in as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were and in and  respectively 
the increase in total revenues mitigated the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues 
research  development and engineering expenses research  development and engineering expenses for were million  a million  or  increase from million for payments received from customers for the development of proprietary battery models are recorded as an offset to research  development and engineering expenses 
such payments totaled million and million in and  respectively 
as a percentage of total revenues  research  development and engineering expenses before such payments for declined to from for this decrease was primarily due to the rapid growth in capacitor sales and the growth in revenues of products that historically have not required significant research  development and engineering expenses  such as medical components and commercial power sources 
other operating expenses intangible amortization was million for and interest expense for was million  a decrease of million  or  from million for this decrease was due to the use of net proceeds from our initial public offering to prepay million of our senior debt 
miscellaneous income of million in compares with miscellaneous expense of million in in  we sold interest rate cap agreements  which were no longer needed due to the prepayment of our senior debt  for a gain of million 
in  we wrote down by million the carrying value of our investment in an unaffiliated company 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate increased to for from for this increase was primarily due to the decrease in state tax credits available to us for as compared with extraordinary charge in addition to the million prepayment of our senior debt with the net proceeds of our initial public offering  we redeemed a portion of our subordinated debt 
these two transactions resulted in an extraordinary charge  net of tax  of million in the charge relates to the write off of fees and other expenses incurred to establish the original debt financing 
net loss our net loss for narrowed to million from a net loss of million in the reduction in net loss was primarily due to an increase in gross profit 
the net loss per share was for  assuming dilution  and for liquidity and capital resources the refinancing of our then remaining senior and subordinated debt in at more favorable terms and the receipt of million in net proceeds from our secondary offering of stock in july have furthered strengthened our financial position 
total assets at december  grew to million  reflecting the common stock proceeds and our acquisition of the net assets of greatbatch sierra 
liquidity as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
this amount primarily reflected the proceeds from our secondary offering of common stock in july  and remains available for general corporate purposes  which may include debt reduction or acquisitions 
cashflow from operations was adequate to cover all required debt servicing  capital expenditures and normal operational costs 
in addition  we have a million line of credit facility  all of which was available at year end 
cash provided by operating activities in was million compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in when compared to both prior years was primarily due to an increase in operating income  which largely reflected improved gross profit and decreased interest expense 
this improvement was somewhat tempered by increases in accounts receivable and inventories  driven by an increased volume of business 
cash provided by operating activities improved in from levels primarily due to an increase in operating income  the receipt of refunds from state tax credits and previously paid income taxes and a reduction in net operating assets 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
our acquisition of greatbatch sierra was the most significant item in  accounting for million of the million 
capital expenditures were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared with cash used in financing activities of million and million in and  respectively 
in january  we consummated a million term loan to pay off the remaining senior and subordinated debt outstanding at that time  including a call premium 
an additional million was borrowed in june to finance the acquisition of greatbatch sierra 
in july  we received million in net proceeds from an offering of our common stock 
in  we used the proceeds from our initial public offering and cash generated by operating activities to prepay or make regularly scheduled payments of million on our senior debt  including our revolving line of credit 
we redeemed million of our subordinated notes and purchased million of common stock from the holder of the redeemed notes 
in  we also sold million of our stock to the previous owner of bei and used these proceeds to pay off the million in debt we assumed in the bei acquisition 
cash used in financing activities in was primarily the result of ongoing operational debt and equity transactions  and an earnout payment related to our acquisition of greatbatch hittman 
we believe that cash generated from operations  combined with our available cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for the near term 
capital expenditures for are expected to increase from historical levels  as we invest in increased production capacity and product development opportunities 
these investments include completion of an expansion to our research and development facilities  which began in should other suitable investment opportunities arise during fiscal  including acquisitions  we believe that our earnings  cash flows and balance sheet will permit us to obtain additional debt or equity capital  if necessary 
there can be no assurance  however  that additional financing will be available to us or  if available  that it can be obtained on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us 
capital structure our capital structure consists of interest bearing debt and equity 
interest bearing debt as a percentage of our total capitalization increased to at december  compared with at december   primarily due to the additional debt incurred to finance the acquisition of greatbatch sierra 
the december  percentage of debt net of cash as a percentage of total capitalization was 
our long term debt at december  consisted of a term loan 
there was also a million revolving line of credit available  none of which was outstanding at year end 
in january  we consummated a million credit facility that consisted of a million term loan and a million revolving line of credit 
both the term loan and the revolving line of credit had a term of five years and would have matured on january  we used the proceeds from this term loan to pay off the remaining senior debt and the senior subordinated notes that were outstanding as of december   plus accrued interest and a call premium 
at that date  there was million net amount outstanding under our senior subordinated notes  million outstanding under our term a loan facility and million outstanding under our term b loan facility 
there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit 
at december   the weighted average interest rate for our term a loans was and the weighted averaged interest rate for our term b loans was 
in june  in conjunction with the acquisition of greatbatch sierra  we amended our credit facility with a consortium of banks by increasing the total size of the facility to million 
the amended facility consisted of an million term loan and a million revolving line of credit 
both the term loan and the revolving line of credit have a term of five years  maturing in july this credit agreement is secured by our accounts receivable and inventories and requires us to comply with various quarterly financial covenants related to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  as it is defined in the credit agreement  and ratios of leverage  interest and fixed charges as they relate to ebitda 
both the term loan and the revolving line of credit bear interest at a rate that varies with our level of leverage 
at december  leverage levels  the applicable interest rates for both the term loan and revolving line of credit were prime less  or the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus  at our option 
at march   the weighted average interest rate for the term loan was  and there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant effect on our operations 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and supersedes apb no 
 business combinations 
effective july   all business combinations in the scope of this new statement are to be accounted for using one method  the purchase method 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes apb no 
 intangible assets 
it changes the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
we adopted sfas no 
effective december   which was the first day of fiscal  and will cease the amortization of goodwill and any other intangible assets with an indefinite life which were recorded in past business combinations 
total amortization expense of all intangible assets was million before tax  per diluted share for the year ended december  and million before tax  per diluted share for the year ended december  of these amounts  million and million in and  respectively  represented amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives that would not have been amortized if sfas no 
had been in effect for those years 
sfas no 
also requires the company  in the year of adoption and for each year thereafter  to analyze all intangible assets for possible impairment  and to write such assets down to fair market value 
the company continues to evaluate the impact of sfas no 
on its financial position and results of operations  however  based on the transitional goodwill impairment test  no impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets is anticipated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under the credit facility consummated in june  both the term loan and any borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at fluctuating market rates 
an analysis of the impact on the company s interest rate sensitive financial instruments of a hypothetical change in short term interest rates shows an impact on expected earnings of less than million of higher or lower earnings  depending on whether short term rates rise or fall by the 
the discussion and the estimated amounts referred to above include forward looking statements of market risk  which involve certain assumptions as to market interest rates 
actual future market conditions may differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  the forward looking statements should not be considered projections of future events by our company
