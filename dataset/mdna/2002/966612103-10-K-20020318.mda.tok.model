item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of this discussion and analysis is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition of whitney holding corporation and its subsidiaries the company or whitney and on their results of operations during  and virtually all of the company s operations are contained in its banking subsidiary  whitney national bank the bank 
this discussion and analysis is intended to highlight and supplement information presented elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly the consolidated financial statements and related notes in item certain financial information in prior years has been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation 
overview whitney made three business acquisitions in and two in as detailed in note  incurring conversion and other merger expenses related to the acquisitions in each of these years and recognizing a merger related gain in table compares net income  earnings per share  return on average assets and return on average shareholders equity for  and  showing the effect of these merger related items 
table effects of merger related items years ended december dollars in millions  except per share data earnings before tax effected merger related items tax effected merger related items 
net income basic earnings per share before tax effected merger related items effect of tax effected merger related items 

basic earnings per share return on average assets before tax effected merger related items effect of tax effected merger related items 

return on average assets return on average shareholders equity before tax effected merger related items effect of tax effected merger related items 

return on average shareholders equity the company earned per share  or million  for  excluding tax effected merger related items 
this is a increase over the per share  or million  earned for the key components of s earnings performance follow o net interest income  on a taxable equivalent te basis  increased  or million  from whitney was and continues to be moderately asset sensitive  which implies it would experience some compression in its net interest margin in a declining rate environment  holding other factors constant 
short term market rates declined sharply during  and whitney s net interest margin te of was basis points below the margin in the mix of funding sources has been favorably impacted by an increase in overall liquidity during  however  the mix of earning assets has trended toward investment vehicles with a smaller spread to the cost of funds because of a slowing in loan demand 
o noninterest income  excluding securities transactions  grew in  or million  including a merger related gain of approximately million 
service charges on deposit accounts increased  or million  and secondary mortgage market operations generated a million increase in fee income 
at the end of the third quarter of  whitney recognized a million gain when it sold its merchant processing agreements to a firm that specializes in this business  retaining an interest in the net revenues produced through an alliance formed with the specialist 
this move lowered fourth quarter noninterest income by approximately million and noninterest expense by million 
o noninterest expense  excluding merger related costs  increased a moderate  or million  page of pages between and  including an increase of million in purchased intangibles amortization related to acquisitions 
adjusting for the impact of the merchant business sale  the increase in noninterest expense would have been approximately  or million 
ongoing expense control efforts and savings from system integration activities have helped offset growth in noninterest expense from purchased operations 
o the company provided million for possible loan losses in compared to million in as the economy entered into a recession in and experienced the initial repercussions of the september terrorist attacks  customer credit risks increased throughout most of the banking industry 
this was also the case for whitney 
net charge offs increased to million in from million in  and nonperforming assets were 
of loans plus foreclosed assets and surplus bank property at the end of compared to 
a year earlier 
whitney s overall credit quality picture  however  continued to compare favorably to industry statistics 
per share earnings of in before tax effected merger related items were higher than the per share earned in the million earned in before merger items was million above the million earned in growth in net interest income te of  or million  reflected a increase in loans in and a healthy net interest margin that showed only limited compression as a result of the greater use of higher cost sources of funds to support earning asset growth 
noninterest income  excluding securities transactions  grew  or million 
important factors  in addition to expansion into the houston  texas market in early  included the positive impact of whitney securities first full year of operations and the growth in fees from merchant processing and credit and debit card activity on increased transaction volumes and strategic adjustments to service fee schedules 
noninterest expense  excluding merger related costs  increased  or million  between and  with much of this increase attributable to the houston expansion and other bank operations acquired in  including purchased intangibles amortization of million 
excluding these operations  noninterest expense increased less than in expense control efforts had a favorable impact on the growth rate of several major expense categories 
a moderate increase in the risk profile of the loan portfolio  coupled with strong loan growth  were the major factors behind the million increase in the provision for possible loan losses in forward looking statements this discussion contains forward looking statements as that term is defined by the private securities litigation reform act of such statements include  but may not be limited to  comments about the sensitivity of whitney s net interest margin to changing market interest rate environments  comments regarding the expected growth rate of the loan portfolio  statements of the results of net interest income simulations run by the company to measure interest rate sensitivity  and comments about possible future benefits to be derived from whitney s recently formed alliance to provide credit card sale processing services to its merchant customers 
factors that could affect actual results and potential benefits include the actual timing and extent of future interest rate movements  trends in whitney s earning assets and sources of funds  the level of success of asset liability management strategies implemented  trends in credit card sale activity in whitney s market area and the success of ongoing customer development and retention efforts by the alliance 
in making forward looking statement  management makes assumptions about these and other factors 
other important factors include  but are not limited to  the economic strength and the performance of the economies in whitney s market area  actions that may be taken by the federal reserve board to influence interest rates in response to changing economic conditions  changes in laws and regulations affecting the activities of the banking industry and other financial service providers  the nature and level of competition  trends in customer behavior and preferences  and the company s ability to execute its plans to respond effectively 
because it is uncertain whether future conditions and events will confirm the company s assumptions  there is a risk that whitney s future results will differ materially from what is stated in or implied by such forward looking statements 
the company cautions readers to consider this risk 
whitney undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement included in this discussion  whether as a result of new information  future events or developments  or for any other reason 
page of pages loans and reserve for possible loan losses the rate of portfolio lending slowed in  reflecting economic conditions and market uncertainty 
average loans increased  or million  in compared to growth in of  or million 
total loans were little changed between the end of and table  which is based on regulatory reporting codes  shows loan balances at december  and at the end of the previous four years 
table loans outstanding by type december dollars in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural loans      real estate loans commercial and other      real estate loans retail mortgage      loans to individuals      total loans      commercial loans  including those secured by real property  increased approximately million  or  on average in  but were up only million  or  between year end and commercial real estate lending  which encompasses loans secured by properties used in commercial or industrial operations  increased million  or  on average  but only million  or  from the prior year end 
the year over year increase in was 
growth in this portfolio category in has been limited  as anticipated  by developers taking advantage of permanent financing opportunities in a favorable rate environment and a moderating pace of new project development 
in recent years  growth came from a variety of sources  including apartment and condominium projects largely in the eastern gulf coast region  and retail  small office and industrial and commercial facilities throughout the company s market area 
loans for hotel projects were stable during both and after growing rapidly in previous years with new construction spurred by a strong convention and tourism industry in the new orleans metropolitan area 
hotel loans were approximately of total commercial real estate loans at the end of both and in the current economic environment  a return to significantly faster growth in the commercial real estate portfolio in is not anticipated 
commercial loans other than those secured by real property increased on average by million  or  in  but were  or million  higher than year end this followed a million  or  increase in from the end of most portfolio sectors were relatively stable during  although there was some noticeable growth in loans to customers in the oil and gas and maritime industries 
also included in this category are loans to individuals  generally secured by collateral other than real estate  that are used to fund investments in new or expanded business opportunities 
increased economic uncertainty and reduced opportunities led to a decrease in such investment loans in after two years of rapid growth 
overall  the portfolio remained well diversified 
participations in syndicated commercial loans at december   totaled approximately million  including million related to the oil and gas industry and million to the gaming industry 
all of these loans are with customers operating in whitney s market area and are subject to standard underwriting criteria 
the rate of commercial loan growth in will depend mainly on the economic fundamentals of the company s market area as well as on its ability to develop customers in the newer parts of its market and take advantage of competitive circumstances to attract new business in its established market 
loans to customers related to the oil and gas industry increased million in from the end of the previous year after a million increase in whitney s customer base mainly provides services and products to support exploration and production activities 
an improvement in underlying commodity prices helped maintain active production levels through much of and began to stimulate new exploration and development activity 
commodity prices turned lower toward the latter part of in reaction to slowing global demand for energy  and production activity has been reduced 
the commitment to new exploration and development is impacted more by changes in longer term expectations about demand and prices 
the level of activity in this industry continues to have an important impact on the economies of certain portions of whitney s market area  particularly southern louisiana and houston 
at december   outstanding loans to oil and gas industry customers totaled million  or approximately of total loans 
page of pages retail loans  including both retail mortgage loans and other loans to individuals  increased million on average in  but decreased million  or  from the end of with the shift late in to a strategy of selling substantially all residential mortgage loan production in the secondary market  retail mortgage loans decreased million  or  in from year end this category had grown million  or  in the major factor behind the increase in was the growth in the origination of adjustable rate mortgage loan products  which then were being retained in the portfolio  particularly as market rates rose in the second half of and into whitney continued to promote its fixed term home equity loan product in such loans increased million  or  in  after an increase of million  or  in this product offers customers the opportunity to leverage increased home values and equity to obtain tax advantaged consumer financing 
loans to individuals include various consumer installment and credit line loan products other than retail mortgage loan products 
in early  management decided to also begin selling student loan production at the earliest possible date rather than holding such loans through the student deferment period 
the company sold million of qualifying student loans from the existing portfolio in january including the impact of this decision  loans to individuals decreased million  or  in the increase in over resulted mainly from loans with customers of acquired bank operations 
whitney s exit from one segment of this market in and consumer preference for tax advantaged home equity financing continued to impede growth in this category during and table reflects contractual loan maturities  unadjusted for scheduled principal reductions  prepayments or repricing opportunities

management s evaluation of this risk is ultimately reflected in the company s financial statements by the level of the reserve for possible loan losses  and changes in this ongoing evaluation over time are reflected in the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense

recoveries to gross charge offs reserve for possible loan losses to loans at end of year in making its risk evaluation and establishing a reserve level that it believes is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio  management considers various sources of information 
some of the more important sources include analyses prepared on specific loans reviewed for impairment  statistics on balances of loans assigned to internal risk rating categories by loan officers and the company s independent credit review function  reports on the composition and repayment performance of consumer and other loan portfolios not subject to individual risk ratings  and factors developed through ongoing migration analysis of historical loss experience 
in addition to this more objective and quantitative information  management s evaluation must take into consideration its assessment of general economic conditions and how current conditions affect specific segments of borrowers 
management must also come to a judgment regarding the level of accuracy inherent in the loss reserve estimation process 
a formal reserve analysis is prepared at least quarterly that summarizes the results of the evaluation process and helps ensure a consistent process over time 
in as in  the credit risk profile of the company s customers increased moderately  led by commercial loans not secured by real estate  but the overall profile remained well within acceptable limits and compared favorably to industry statistics 
the increased risk profile is evident in higher levels of nonperforming loans and loans internally classified as having above normal credit risk as discussed below 
as would be expected  the percentage of the reserve allocated to commercial loans has also increased as is shown in table management s evaluation of credit risk included an assessment of what impact the economic repercussions of the terrorist attacks on the united states could have on the company s customers 
in whitney s market area  the most immediate impact was felt by businesses related to the page of pages convention and tourism industry  including  among others  hotels and restaurants  and by the employees of these businesses 
loan officers are monitoring the operations of affected customers and their responses to this evolving situation 
management used stress tests to identify credits that would have the most difficulty with debt service if there were to be a prolonged downturn more severe than would have been considered in the normal underwriting process 
stress tests were applied to approximately million of loans and commitments for hotel financing and million of restaurant industry loans  and the results indicated acceptable levels of risk 
the lasting impact of these attacks remains uncertain  however  and this uncertainty along with questions concerning the depth of the economic slowdown in are reflected in the level of unallocated reserves

this compared to approximately at december  the december  total of million was page of pages million above year end s total 
the increase during was largely influenced by participations in credit facilities with two customers in whitney s market area that were included in the shared national credit review process by federal banking regulators 
loans warranting special attention because of risk characteristics that indicate potential weaknesses totaled million at december   little changed from the prior year end 
there was a million increase  to a total of million  in loans classified as having well defined weaknesses that  if not corrected  would likely result in some loss

between these same periods  average federal funds sold and other short term investments increased million  reflecting increased liquidity from growth in deposit funding sources during as discussed in the following section 
the weighted average taxable equivalent portfolio yield was at december   a decrease of basis points from approximately at december   reflecting mainly lower rates for reinvestment opportunities in substantially all of the securities in the investment portfolio bear fixed interest rates

effective january   the company reclassified securities with a carrying value of million  and an unrealized net loss of million  as available for sale in connection with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
these securities had previously been classified as held to maturity 
securities available for page of pages sale are reported at estimated fair market value in the consolidated balance sheets

during the company had begun building its investment in securities classified as available for sale  primarily as a means to increase liquidity management flexibility 
with the reclassification in  such securities constituted of the total investment portfolio at december  the net unrealized gain on available for sale securities was million at year end the improvement from an unrealized net gain of million at the end of  before the reclassification  reflected the favorable impact of generally lower market interest rates on fixed income security prices 
the company does not normally maintain a trading portfolio 
occasionally  the bank holds immaterial amounts of trading account securities for short periods while buying and selling securities for customers 
such securities  if any  are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
at december   whitney held no investment in securities of a single issuer  other than securities issued or guaranteed by the u

government or its agencies  that exceeded of its shareholders equity 
the company has made no investments in financial instruments or participated in agreements with values that are linked to or derived from changes in the value of some underlying asset or index 
these financial instruments or agreements are commonly referred to as derivatives and include such instruments as futures  forward contracts  option contracts  interest rate swap agreements and other financial arrangements with similar characteristics 
management continues to evaluate whether to use derivatives as part of its asset liability and liquidity management processes 
deposits and short term borrowings average deposits increased  or million  in  and were up  or million  in deposits associated with purchased bank operations contributed approximately million to average deposit growth in and million in deposit growth accelerated in with the competitive positioning of new money market deposit products for businesses and individuals and greater demand for the safety and liquidity of deposit products in response to turmoil in the capital markets

these deposits had increased strongly in as whitney responded to rising short term market rates during that period with competitively structured time deposit products 
the growth in time deposits over  in both and also reflected an increase in eurodollar deposits  including funds from new and existing corporate customers for cash management purposes 
table shows the maturity structure of time deposits over and under  at december  noninterest bearing demand deposits were also higher in  having grown  or million on average  from table shows that noninterest bearing deposits have remained a healthy percentage of average total deposits over the last three years  with the small decrease in reflecting the flow of liquidity to interest bearing deposit products 
deposits in traditional savings accounts were steady in  but would have been lower absent purchased operations  continuing a trend that reflects consumer preference for the convenience and flexibility offered by newer deposit products

these borrowings consist primarily of purchases of federal funds and sales of securities under repurchase agreements 
total average short term borrowings were  or million  lower in following a  or million  increase in in  the company made little use of available wholesale short term funding sources  such as overnight and term federal funds purchased and brokered repurchase agreements  as it had in to fund strong loan growth 
average short term borrowings from customers under repurchase agreements were stable in  after increasing in to approximately million 
increased funding from this source in recent years reflected both the growth in commercial relationships and the attractiveness of whitney s treasury management sweep product 
because of the underlying customer relationship  these borrowings can be a relatively stable source of funds 
shareholders equity and capital adequacy at december   shareholders equity totaled million compared to million at the end of and million at the end of the major factors in the million increase in were earnings  net of dividends declared  of million  and an million increase in other comprehensive income representing an unrealized net holding gain on securities available for sale 
in  net retained earnings of million and the million value of common stock issued to purchase first ascension bancorp  inc led to a million increase in shareholders equity 
over the last three years  the dividend payout ratio has been relatively stable  increasing slightly to in from in and in whitney last executed a stock repurchase program in  when it repurchased one million shares for million 
the company has no program currently  but will consider similar programs in the future as appropriate opportunities arise 
the ratios in table indicate that the company remained strongly capitalized at december  the overall reduction in the capital ratios in recent years from earlier levels has been influenced mainly by the rate of asset growth coupled with the decisions made and actions taken by the company in managing its capital position  including the stock repurchase program 
cash business acquisitions  such as the purchases of redstone financial  inc in and bank of houston in  will also reduce regulatory capital ratios 
in these transactions  the company acquires intangible assets that are deducted in determining regulatory capital and excluded from risk weighted assets

liquidity the object of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available to meet cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  while at the same time meeting the operating  capital and strategic cash flow needs of the company and the bank  all in the most cost effective manner 
the company develops it liquidity management strategies and measures and monitors liquidity risk as part of its overall asset liability management process  making full use of the quantitative modeling tools available to project cash flows under a variety of possible scenarios 
projections are also made assuming credit stressed conditions  although such conditions are not likely to arise 
on the liability side  liquidity management focuses on growing the base of more stable core deposits at competitive rates  including the use of treasury management products for commercial customers  while at the same time ensuring access to economical wholesale funding sources 
the section above on deposits and short term borrowings discusses changes in these liability funding sources in and during  whitney national bank became a member of the federal home loan bank system 
this membership provides access to a variety of federal home loan bank advance products as an alternative source of funds 
in addition  both the company and the bank have access to external funding sources in the financial markets  and the bank has developed the ability to gather deposits at a nationwide level 
liquidity management on the asset side primarily addresses the composition and maturity structure of the loan and investment securities portfolios and their impact on the company s ability to generate cash flows from scheduled payments  contractual maturities  prepayments  their use as collateral for borrowings under repurchase agreements and possible outright sales or securitizations 
table above presents the contractual maturity structure of the loan portfolio and table presents contractual investment maturities 
as mentioned earlier  the company began building its investment in securities classified as available for sale in and  effective  reclassified in excess of million of its portfolio of securities held to maturity to this category 
these actions further increased liquidity management flexibility 
cash generated from operations is another important source of funds to meet liquidity needs 
the consolidated statements of cash flows present operating cash flows and summarize all significant sources and uses of funds for each year in the three year period ended december  the bank saw its liquidity position grow throughout reflecting strong deposit inflows  moderate loan demand  and an attractive refinancing environment 
this liquidity position will likely return to more normal levels with increased economic activity  a return to confidence in the capital markets and rising market interest rates 
whitney holding corporation had approximately million in cash available for acquisitions  dividend payments to shareholders  or other corporate uses at the end of  before consideration of any future dividends that may be received from the bank 
because the bank received approval to pay the company dividends above limits set by statutory and regulatory provisions in  the bank will be required to seek continuing approval to declare future dividends to the company until it reestablishes dividend capacity under those provisions 
the bank had approximately billion in unfunded loan commitments outstanding at december   an increase of million from s year end 
note shows the details of these and other unfunded commitments at december  and because loan commitments may  and many times do  expire without being drawn upon  unfunded balances should not be used as a projection of actual future liquidity requirements 
page of pages asset liability management the objective of the company s asset liability management is to implement strategies for the funding and deployment of its financial resources that are expected to maximize soundness and profitability over time at acceptable levels of risk 
interest rate sensitivity is the potential impact of changing rate environments on both net interest income and cash flows 
the company and the bank obtain measures of their interest rate sensitivity by running net interest income simulations  monitoring the economic value of equity and preparing gap analyses 
the simplest method of measuring interest rate sensitivity is gap analysis  which identifies the difference between the dollar volume of assets and liabilities that reprice within specified time periods 
gap analysis has several limitations  including the fact that it is a point in time measurement 
table shows the company s static gap position as of december  table interest rate sensitivity by maturity or repricing dates at december  after noninterest dollars in millions days days days days year bearing total assets securities available for sale   securities held to maturity loans    federal funds sold and short term investments other assets total assets    sources of funds now account deposits money market deposits   savings deposits other time deposits  time deposits  and over short term borrowings noninterest bearing demand deposits   other liabilities shareholders equity total sources of funds    interest rate sensitivity gap   cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap  cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of total earning assets table indicates that the company is somewhat liability sensitive in the near term 
however  static gap does not take into consideration the actions that management intends to take to maximize net interest income over time 
a more sophisticated tool used by the company to evaluate and manage its interest rate sensitivity is a net interest income simulation model  which tests the bank s reaction to various economic environments 
the model is able to incorporate management s assumptions and expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth  pricing  prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates 
assumptions can also be entered into the model to evaluate the impact of possible strategic responses to changes in the competitive environment 
as part of its regular formal asset liability management process  a base case simulation is run that uses current growth forecasts and assumes a stable rate environment and structure 
the base case simulation as of the end of showed an increase in net interest income te for the next twelve month period of approximately million  or  from levels 
when the base case simulation was subjected to parallel up and down instantaneous rate shocks of basis points  the model showed an annual impact on whitney s net interest income te that ranged from a positive million at basis points up to a negative million at basis points down 
additional simulations were run applying instantaneous parallel rate shocks up to basis points as well as gradual rate changes of up to basis points 
in the current rate environment  certain downward rate shocks caused unrealistic model assumptions  and the results from these page of pages simulation runs were disregarded 
the results of other simulations showed that the company s sensitivity was within acceptable limits  considering established internal guidelines 
unlike the gap analysis  the net interest income simulations at the end of indicate that the company is moderately asset sensitive 
the actual impact of changing interest rates on net interest income  however  is dependent on many factors 
these include whitney s ability to achieve growth in earning assets and maintain a desired mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the actual timing of repricing of assets and liabilities  the magnitude of interest rate changes  interest rate spreads and the level of success of asset liability management strategies implemented 
the method used for measuring longer term interest rate risk is the economic value of equity analysis 
at year end  the company s sensitivity was acceptable under internal guidelines at all levels of rate shock simulation that produced realistic results 
changes in interest rates affect the fair values of financial instruments 
note contains information regarding these fair values 
the differences between fair values and book values were primarily the result of differences between contractual and market interest rates at each year end 
fluctuations in fair values will occur as interest rates change 
impact of inflation and changing prices the great majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
management believes the most significant potential impact of inflationary or deflationary economic cycles on whitney s financial results is its ability to react to changes in interest rates 
interest rates do not  however  necessarily move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as the prices of goods and services 
as discussed above  the company employs asset liability management strategies in its attempt to minimize the effects of economic cycles on its net interest income 
inflation and changing prices also have an impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
changing prices will also affect the trend in noninterest operating expenses and noninterest income 
page of pages results of operations net interest income net interest income te increased  or million  in  following a  or million  increase in over as discussed earlier  whitney was moderately asset sensitive throughout  which implies that it would experience some compression in its net interest margin in a declining rate environment  holding other factors constant 
the net interest margin  which is net interest income te as a percent of average earning assets  decreased to in from in and in the margin compression in came as an basis point decrease in the yield te on earning assets was not fully matched by a basis point decrease in the cost of funding these assets 
between and  the earning asset yield increased basis points while the cost of funds increased basis points  leading to the basis point decline in the net interest margin between these periods 
tables and show the factors contributing to these changes and the components of these changes 
there was a moderate increase in average loans in compared to a increase in over average loans as a percent of earning assets declined to below in after reaching a high for recent years in there was a corresponding surge in short term investments in that was prompted by increased liquidity in a period of reduced loan demand 
for the year  short term investments grew to over of average earning assets from less than in the loan portfolio yield te decreased basis points between and  reflecting a basis point decline in the average prime rate 
approximately of the value of the loan portfolio at year end is subject to repricing within one year  which is up from at year end with declining loan yields  the overall yield on earning assets is was basis points lower than in in  the mix of earning assets had followed a favorable trend of recent years  driven by strong loan growth 
the growth in average loans in was well above the rate of growth in total average earning assets 
as a result  loans comprised of average earning assets in  up from in the improved asset mix  as well as a basis point increase in the loan yield te  led to the basis point increase in the yield te on total earning assets

while the cost of short term borrowings decreased quickly throughout  falling basis points on average in response to falling market rates  the maturity structure of fixed rate time deposits was such that the cost of these deposits declined much more slowly  although the pace accelerated in the third and fourth quarters of the year

income from service charges on deposit accounts increased  or million  in after an increase of  or million  in whitney implemented refinements to its pricing policies for certain business accounts during the second quarter of and  as short term market interest rates declined throughout the year  appropriately lowered the earnings credit allowed as an offset to service charges on these accounts 
the combined impact helped increase business service fees by million compared to also during s second quarter  the company began introducing automated tools to help banking officers with certain service fee decisions and to measure their performance against corporate standards 
the impact of those tools together with underlying growth in the deposit customer base accounted for the remaining increase in income from service charges on deposit accounts 
fee based deposit accounts also grew in  including the impact of acquisitions  but corresponding growth in service charge income was restrained in part by the impact on the earnings credit of higher short term market rates during that year 
at the end of s third quarter  whitney entered into an alliance with a firm that specializes in processing credit card sale transactions for merchants 
in forming this alliance  whitney sold its existing merchant processing agreements to the specialist firm and recognized a gain of million  while maintaining an interest in the ongoing net revenues generated through the alliance 
this move will initially reduce future noninterest income by an estimated million annually and noninterest expense by million 
for the fourth quarter of  the reductions were approximately million of income and million of expense 
over time  results from the alliance are expected to fully benefit from the specialist s page of pages significant operating efficiencies and from additional growth in the merchant customer base through focused sales management and enhanced customer service 
as a result of this move  credit card income decreased  or million  in  after having grown  or million  in this income category includes fees from merchant processing services and from activity on bank issued credit and debit cards 
fee income from debit card activity has made an increasingly important contribution in recent years as the company expanded the distribution of its product and saw increasing acceptance and use of these cards for retail transactions 
debit card fee income was up  or million  in on a increase in transaction volume and a increase in the cardholder base 
this followed income growth of  or 
million  in when transaction volume rose and the base increased 
fee income from credit card activity grew in  consistent with the growth in transaction volume  and was up in trust service fees increased in and in marketing and incentive based sales efforts across whitney s market area have been successful in building the customer base for trust services 
the continuing weakness in equity markets  however  has limited the company s ability to achieve the fee income growth rates of earlier years when financial markets performed strongly over a sustained period 
secondary mortgage market operations posted a million increase in fee income to a level over three times that in late in the third quarter of  the company began to shift away from retaining new residential mortgage loans for the portfolio 
in addition  favorable market rates and an expanded sales force generated strong origination volumes throughout refinancing activity accounted for approximately of the million of loans originated in whitney sold approximately of this production  compared to of the million originated in with a rise in market rates in the latter part of that continued through most of  residential mortgage loan production in had slowed and the company s origination efforts shifted to adjustable rate loans that it held in portfolio 
this led to a  or million  decline in income from secondary mortgage market operations in compared to investment service income grew  or million  in  mainly because increased demand for fixed income securities offset softness in retail brokerage activity that was brought on by weak equity markets 
whitney securities  the company s broker dealer unit  had its first full year of operations in after its inception in the third quarter of the performance of this unit was the primary factor behind the  or million  increase in investment services income in late in the second quarter of  the company opened a new parking facility next to its main office 
the operating revenue from this facility totaled million in and 
million in and accounts for almost half of the increase in the other operating income category in the remaining increase in this category between and and the small decrease in resulted mainly from certain one time items 
net gains on sales and other dispositions of foreclosed assets include income from sales of grandfathered assets that vary from year to year as opportunities for sales arise 
management evaluates its banking facilities on an ongoing basis to identify possible under utilization and to determine the need for functional improvements  relocations or possible sales

reductions in staff levels achieved through the integration of the operations of pooled entities acquired in early helped limit the overall increase 
an increase in stock based compensation  which fluctuates with changes in whitney s stock price  led to an overall million increase in long term incentive plan expense 
effective  whitney increased the percentage of employee k plan savings that is matches 
the impact of this change and an increase in the cost of health benefits were the major factors behind the rise in employee benefits expense 
adjusting for the impact of purchased operations  the overall increase in personnel expense would have been  or million  with base salaries and incentive compensation rising  or million  and employee benefits decreasing 
the favorable impact on compensation expense of a net reduction in average staff levels for was offset by regular merit increases and higher employee sales incentive compensation  increased hiring incentives  and a 
million net increase in long term incentive plan compensation 
an 
million reduction in the actuarially determined expense for the defined benefit pension plan more than offset the rise in health benefit plan costs in  leading to the net decrease in employee benefits expense  excluding purchased operations 
equipment and data processing expense was  or million  lower in  following an increase of  or 
million  in whitney has achieved savings from systems integration activities completed in and close control over capital expenditures and service agreements over the past several years 
these savings helped offset the recurring page of pages costs added for purchased operations and enhanced applications  including those associated with expanding internet based banking services that were first introduced in the second half of net occupancy expense increased  or million  in  following a  or million  increase in purchased operations were a factor in each year  accounting for over one third of the increase in functional improvement projects at certain facilities  including the main office in new orleans  led to increased depreciation expense in both and  and high energy prices in the first part of the year increased utility expense in for  there was a net increase in recurring expenses associated with the relocation of certain louisiana bank operations to more suitable leased premises  and the parking garage completed its first full year of operations 
for both and  the elimination of under utilized facilities helped offset the growth in occupancy expense from the factors cited above 
in addition  beginning in  the company reevaluated many of its facilities service contracts and negotiated changes that helped limit growth in maintenance and repairs expense 
credit card processing services expense decreased  or million  in  largely as a result of the merchant business sale discussed earlier 
adjusting for the impact of the sale  this expense category decreased in following a increase in these changes compare with related revenue growth of on an adjusted basis in and in the favorable spread between revenue and expense growth rates mainly reflected the impact of adjustments to merchant processing service fee schedules in telecommunication and postage expense was little changed in following a increase in the impact of the postal rate increase that took effect in early was offset by expense reductions associated with the restructuring of the company s data communication contracts 
the increase in mainly reflected an expanding branch network and overall growth in the customer base  including the impact of acquisitions 
the expense for legal and professional services increased in after rising in legal expense rose in  partly as a result of services provided in forming the merchant business alliance  after being stable in as would be expected  there has also been increased demand for legal services to support loan collection efforts 
the expense for consulting and other professional services was lower in  following an increase in consulting services related to the company s entry into the houston  texas market and market research services were the major factors behind the increase in  offsetting the elimination of services for year remediation testing in the prior year 
the business acquisitions in and accounted for all of the increases in the amortization of intangibles in these two years 
as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  there will be no goodwill amortization in and later years  although goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment 
goodwill amortization totaled million in  million in and million in scheduled amortization of intangible assets other than goodwill in is million 
no indication of goodwill impairment was identified in the preliminary initial assessment required by sfas no 
the expense for security and other outsourced services increased in after rising in these increases reflected in large part decisions to outsource certain back office operations in and the extension of existing service arrangements to acquired operations 
the benefit of staff reductions from outsourcing decisions has been reflected in personnel expense 
the favorable impact of ongoing expense control efforts in recent years is evident in the stationery and supplies expense category which rose in after a decrease in the success of these efforts also factored into the decrease in other operating expense in toward the end of  whitney launched a multi faceted advertising campaign featuring a louisiana based celebrity spokesperson 
costs associated with this ongoing campaign  which initially focused on promoting the company s new internet banking services  contributed to increases in advertising expense of  or 
million  in and  or million  in introductory campaigns in the houston market and some increase in product specific sales campaigns also contributed to the rise in the company and its acquired entities recognize various nonrecurring expenses to complete merger transactions and to integrate the acquired operations into the whitney system 
these merger related expenses include change in control payments and severance or retention bonuses for management and employees of a merged entity  investment banker fees  fees for various professional services and losses on cancellation of contracts and the disposition of obsolete and redundant facilities and equipment 
total merger related expenses vary with each transaction 
income taxes income tax expense was million in  million in and million in the company s effective tax rate was in  in and in these effective rates were lower than the page of pages federal statutory tax rate primarily because of tax exempt interest income received from the financing of state and local governments 
the increase in mainly reflected the termination of the subchapter s election for post merger earnings from american bank s operations  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the subchapter s termination  however  whitney also recorded a deferred tax benefit of approximately million in that partly offset the impact of the taxability of post merger earnings 
louisiana sourced income of commercial banks is not subject to state income taxes 
rather  banks in louisiana pay a tax based on the value of their capital stock in lieu of income and franchise taxes  and these ad valorem taxes are included in noninterest expense 
this expense will fluctuate based in part on the growth in the bank s equity and earnings and in part based on market valuation trends for the banking industry
