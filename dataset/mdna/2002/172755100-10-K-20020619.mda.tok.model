result of operations the following table summarizes the results of our operations for each of the past three fiscal years as a percentage of net sales 
all percentage amounts were calculated using the underlying data in thousands fiscal years ended march  march  march  net sales gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative provision benefit for doubtful accounts restructuring costs and other  net abandonment of assets charge acquired in process research and development expenses income loss from operations realized gain on the sale of marketable equity securities interest expense interest income other income expense income loss before provision for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes minority interest in loss of emicro income loss before extraordinary gain and accounting change extraordinary gain  net of income taxes cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income loss net sales net sales for fiscal decreased million  or  to million from million in fiscal the decrease in net sales from fiscal to was driven primarily by a million decrease in sales of magnetic storage products due to our exit from that product line during the second quarter of fiscal additionally  sales of computer audio products decreased million and sales of communications products decreased million in fiscal year compared with fiscal  mainly due to poor market conditions 
sales of end of life products decreased million year over year 
sales of market specific processors decreased million in fiscal year  primarily due to the strong production ramp of embedded processors for mp players in advance of fiscal year s christmas season 
net sales for fiscal increased to million  an increase of million  or  from million in fiscal magnetic storage revenues increased million  or  in fiscal additionally  net sales for our market specific processors product line increased million in fiscal  primarily due to the strong production ramp of embedded processors for mp players 
net sales for our optical product line grew million as a result of strong cd rw sales 
revenues from product lines that have been discontinued by us were million compared to million in fiscal effective with the first quarter of fiscal  we changed our revenue recognition policy in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  resulting in a change in the basis for recognizing revenue on all shipments from date of shipment to date of passage of title 
results for fiscal include revenue of million  cost of sales of million  and a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on prior years accumulated deficit of million as a result of this change 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we also changed our estimate of the amount of revenue that is deferred on distributor transactions under agreements with only limited rights of return 
results for the fiscal year ended march  included revenue of million  cost of sales of million and income of million related to this change in estimate 
the effect of this estimate change increased basic and diluted earnings per share by for the fiscal year ended march  export sales  principally to asia  including sales to us based customers with manufacturing plants overseas  were approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal export sales to customers located in the pacific rim excluding japan were   and of net sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
export sales to customers located in japan were   and of net sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
all other export sales were   and of net sales  in fiscal   and  respectively 
our sales are denominated primarily in us dollars 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts to reduce the foreign currency exposures related to sales and balance sheet accounts denominated in yen 
in fiscal  sales to three customers  fujitsu  thomson multimedia  and western digital accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of net sales 
in fiscal  sales to fujitsu and western digital accounted for approximately and  respectively  of net sales 
sales to western digital accounted for approximately of net sales in fiscal no other customers accounted for or more of net sales in fiscal   or the loss of a significant customer or a significant reduction in such a customer s orders could have an adverse effect on our sales 
as a result of our planned exit from the mass storage chip business in the second quarter of fiscal  we are not currently selling to fujitsu or western digital 
our sales to thomson primarily consisted of dvd drive manager devices that are included in microsoft s xbox 
we continue to see forecasts of revenue in the first two quarters of fiscal for these devices although at a lower level 
gross margin gross margin was for fiscal  down from in fiscal the decrease in gross margin from fiscal was primarily the result of inventory charges recorded during fiscal in conjunction with the workforce reduction during the third quarter of fiscal  we went through a detailed market and product review and  as a result  decided to de emphasize certain products 
we recorded a net inventory charge of million related to our restructuring efforts and the exit from our magnetic storage business  and million  mainly to reserve inventory that was excess to short term usage forecasts 
gross margin was in fiscal  down from in fiscal gross margin decreased during fiscal  primarily due to lower margins on sales of magnetic storage products 
in addition  we recognized an inventory charge of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal  mainly to reserve inventory that was excess to short term usage forecasts 
research and development expenses research and development expenditures decreased by million in fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of reduced costs due to the implementation during fiscal of cost reduction and expense control measures  including our workforce reductions in may and october despite the decline in absolute dollar amounts  research and development expenses increased as a percentage of net sales from in fiscal to in fiscal due to the decline in net sales year over year 
research and development expenditures increased by million in fiscal  primarily due to an increase in total employees and the change in employee mix from fiscal at the end of fiscal  approximately of employees were engaged in research and development  compared to at the end of fiscal although these expenses increased in total dollars in fiscal  as a percentage of net sales they decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million in fiscal  primarily due to decreased costs resulting from the implementation of cost reduction and expense control measures in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales from in fiscal to in fiscal despite the decrease in the absolute dollar amounts due to the decrease in net sales year over year 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million in fiscal  mainly due to an increase in headcount of over last year and compensation expense recognized in connection with the acquisition of audiologic  inc although these expenses increased in total dollars in fiscal  as a percentage of net sales they decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal provision benefit for doubtful accounts during fiscal  we recorded a million charge to reserve disputed magnetic storage receivables from western digital and fujitsu  with whom we are currently involved in litigation 
if we are successful in collecting these receivables through the ongoing litigation  we will record an equivalent benefit for doubtful accounts 
during fiscal and  we recorded a benefit for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively  primarily due to the release of excess bad debt reserves 
restructuring costs and other  net during fiscal  we announced a change to our business model that de emphasized our magnetic storage chip business and focused on consumer entertainment electronics 
as a result of these strategic decisions and in response to ongoing economic and industry conditions  we eliminated approximately employee positions worldwide from various business functions and job classes over the course of fiscal we recorded a restructuring charge of million in operating expenses to cover costs associated with these workforce reductions 
in addition  we recorded a million restructuring charge in operating expenses for costs associated with facility consolidations 
as of march   we have a remaining restructuring accrual of million primarily related to net lease expenses that will be paid over the respective lease terms through fiscal and other anticipated lease termination costs 
in fiscal  we recorded million in income to recognize the receipt of two previously reserved notes from intel corporation on behalf of basis communications corporation 
we also recorded million in income  related to the final resolution of the micrus restructuring agreement 
during fiscal  we substantially completed the restructuring activities that were initiated in fiscal we restructured the relationships with our manufacturing joint ventures and returned to a fabless business model 
in fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of million  million of which was in cost of sales 
these restructuring charges included a million direct cash payment to one of the joint venture partners  million related to certain cirrus logic common stock that we issued to one of the joint venture partners  million of lease buyout costs  and million of equipment write offs 
these charges were partially offset by the reversal of approximately million of previously accrued wafer purchase commitment charges due to the renegotiated terms of our purchase commitments with our former partners 
abandonment of assets charge during fiscal  we wrote off a module of our enterprise resource planning software that we no longer plan to use 
as a result of this decision  we recorded a charge of approximately million 
during fiscal  we discontinued development efforts previously undertaken on the manufacturing component of our enterprise resource planning software 
in connection with this decision  we recorded a charge of approximately million 
acquired in process research and development expenses during fiscal  we recorded million of acquired in process research and development expenses  resulting from our acquisitions of peak audio  sharewave  luxsonor semiconductors and stream machine 
we expensed these amounts on the acquisition date because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses 
future acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies by us might also result in charges for acquired in process research and development that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results 
the acquired in process research and development from these four acquisitions pertains to different technologies and products 
we periodically review the stage of completion and likelihood of success of each of the in process research and development projects 
the status of these projects as of march  is as follows peak audio  inc the in process research and development technology from the peak audio acquisition pertains to a signal processing product targeted at the professional installed sound system market 
the product receives audio from sources such as microphones and then  through the use of digital signal processors  modifies the audio and sends it out to power amplifiers 
the processing includes equalization  mixing  and dynamics processing 
the product is designed to be easy to manufacture and can be customized for each particular application 
we estimate that the development cycle for this product will continue for approximately four months 
the estimated cost to complete the development of this technology is expected to be approximately million 
sharewave  inc the in process research and development technology from the sharewave acquisition relates to the development of two different wireless network controller platforms  project a and project b 
project a uses the whitecap tm protocol and will comply with the b industry standard 
the remaining development effort is focused on incorporating a radio controller that functions properly with the mac and on developing several different controller interfaces 
we estimate that the development cycle for this product will continue for approximately six months 
the estimated cost to complete the development of this technology is expected to be approximately million 
project b uses the whitecap tm protocol and was originally intended to comply with the a industry standard 
we have expanded the scope to include compliance with b and g industry standards 
the remaining development effort is focused on both hardware and software functionality 
we estimate that the development cycle for this product will continue for approximately months 
the estimated cost to complete the development of this technology is expected to be approximately million 
luxsonor semiconductors  inc the in process research and development technology from the luxsonor acquisition pertains to the development of an enhanced chip for dvd players 
in addition to the standard dvd player functionality such as mpeg video decoding  audio dsp  a risc controller  and a video processor  this product will support video capture with picture in picture  a second risc processor  and improved graphics 
the main application for this product is high end dvd players 
we estimate that the development cycle for this product will continue for approximately four months 
the estimated cost to complete development of this technology is expected to be approximately million 
stream machine company the in process research and development technology from the stream machine acquisition relates to the development of a bit audio video codec 
the remaining development effort is focused on delivering the chip for first tape out 
once that milestone has been achieved  engineering efforts will focus on debugging and performance testing as well as modifications to fit future reference designs 
we estimate that the development cycle for this product will continue for approximately three months 
the estimated cost to complete the development of this technology is expected to be approximately million 
value assigned to in process research and development we assigned value to the in process research and development projects by calculating the estimated percentage of completion calculated by averaging the time based percentage completed with the cost based percentage completed for each project  applying the percentage to the expected net cash flows for each project  and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
the revenue estimates used to value the purchased in process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us 
the rates we utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value are risk adjusted to reflect the estimated stage of completion for each project 
the estimates used in valuing in process research and development were based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
our assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and no assurance can be given that unanticipated events and circumstances will not occur 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results 
any such variance may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
with respect to the acquired in process technologies  the calculations of value were adjusted to reflect the value creation efforts of each project before the acquisition 
the estimated percentage of completion and technology lives for the in process research and development projects as of march  are as follows estimated percentage expected of useful product completion life peak audio years sharewave project a years sharewave project b years luxsonor years stream machine years the value assigned to each acquired in process research and development project as of the acquisition date was as follows in thousands value product assigned peak audio signal processing product  other peak audio product sharewave project a  sharewave project b  luxsonor  stream machine  during fiscal  we recorded million of acquired in process research and development expenses  resulting from our acquisition of audiologic  inc we expensed these amounts on the acquisition date because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses 
realized gain on the sale of marketable equity securities we realized gains of million related to the sale of marketable equity securities and million related to the sale of call options in openwave systems  inc formerly known as phone 
com common stock during fiscal we realized net gains of million related to the sale of investments in fiscal  primarily from the sale of our interest in basis communications to intel corporation  resulting in a gain of million 
we realized gains of million in fiscal due to our sale of stock and associated options in openwave systems  inc common stock 
we also realized a gain of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to the sale of our interest in ambient technologies to intel corporation 
interest expense interest expense was million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense in both fiscal compared to fiscal  and fiscal versus fiscal  was mainly due to the repurchase and conversion of million of our convertible subordinated notes in fiscal interest income interest income in fiscal   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the decrease in interest income in fiscal  compared with fiscal  was primarily due to lower cash and cash equivalent balances  on which interest was earned during fiscal  and to lower interest rates in fiscal the increase in interest income in fiscal was primarily the result of interest earned on the increased cash and cash equivalent balances at march   compared to march  other income expense other expense in fiscal includes a charge of million related to write offs and write downs of investments in private companies and million related to expenses associated with our foreign subsidiaries 
other expense in fiscal includes a charge of million related to the settlement of a litigation dispute  million write off of an investment in a private company and foreign currency translation losses of million 
other income for fiscal includes million from the release of a wafer purchase accrual previously established in connection with the sale of a technology license due to lower wafer demand than was previously forecasted 
also included in other income is a million reduction of a liability associated with our stock issued as part of the divestiture of the micrus manufacturing joint venture 
income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million for fiscal on a pre tax loss of million 
this benefit generated an effective income tax rate of  which was lower than the us statutory rate of 
the primary reasons our benefit was lower than the statutory rate were that we were not able to take advantage of the current year s net operating loss and there were expenses associated with the four acquisitions that closed during fiscal that were not deductible for tax purposes 
the effective tax rate was also affected by nonrecurring tax benefits recorded during the year  most of which pertained to the settlement of examinations by the internal revenue service for fiscal years through in fiscal years   and  we provided a valuation allowance equal to our net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding whether these assets will be realized 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
in order to recognize these assets  we must be able to determine that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized 
in fiscal year  we recorded income tax expense of million on income before provision for income taxes of million 
our effective income tax rate of approximately in that year was lower than the us statutory rate of primarily because of the utilization of previously reserved net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
in fiscal year  we recorded no income tax expense or benefit  as we were unable to recognize any benefit from the losses incurred in that year 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  we used million in cash from operating activities as opposed to generating million in cash in fiscal and using million in fiscal the cash used in operations in fiscal was a result of our net loss of million  substantially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and inventory of million 
the cash generated by operations in fiscal was primarily the result of operating profits offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory of million and million  respectively 
the cash used in fiscal was primarily due to a net loss of million excluding gains from the sale of securities of million  combined with a million reduction in accounts payable 
we used million in cash from investing activities in fiscal this use was primarily the result of purchases of technology licenses and property and equipment of million  million for our four acquisitions and an increase in restricted cash of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by million in cash proceeds from the sale of marketable equity securities 
we generated million and million in cash from investing activities in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
during fiscal  we sold million of common stock investments 
in addition  the release of million of restricted cash due to reduced lease commitments provided additional funding in fiscal these increases were partially offset by investments of million in new equipment and technology licenses 
during fiscal  we sold million of short term investments 
we also sold approximately two thirds of our holdings in the common stock of phone 
com and our interest in ambient technologies  for a combined million 
in addition  we sold our interest in the cirent manufacturing facility for million 
additionally  the release of million of restricted cash due to reduced lease commitments provided additional funding 
these increases were partially offset by investments of million in new equipment  software  and an erp system 
net cash used in financing activities was million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
we used cash in financing activities in fiscal primarily for the repurchase of million shares of stock for million and payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations of million 
these uses were partially offset by million received for the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options 
we used cash in financing activities in fiscal for the repurchase of convertible subordinated notes and payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations 
these uses of cash were partially offset in fiscal by cash provided from employee stock option exercises 
we used cash in financing activities in fiscal for payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations  which were partially offset by cash provided from employee stock option exercises 
as of march   we have a million letter of credit secured by million in restricted cash 
the letter of credit was issued to secure certain obligations under our lease agreement for a new headquarters facility in austin  texas 
as a result of the acquisition of stream machine  we have million in restricted cash securing a letter of credit related to stream machine s office lease 
we also have million in restricted cash securing a writ of attachment related to ongoing litigation 
the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of march  payment obligations by year in thousands beyond total facilities leases  net        equipment leases capital leases wafer purchase commitments   assembly purchase commitments   total        although we cannot assure that we will be able to generate cash in the future  we anticipate that our existing capital resources and cash flow generated from future operations will enable us to maintain our current level of operations for the next twelve months 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas also defines the criteria for recognizing and reporting intangible assets acquired in a business combination as assets apart from goodwill 
we followed sfas for our three acquisitions in fiscal that were completed after june  in june  the fasb also issued sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are tested annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life and tested for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of 
the amortization provisions of sfas applied immediately to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  consequently  goodwill totaling million from the three business combinations initiated after june  was not amortized during fiscal year during fiscal  we continued to amortize goodwill and assembled workforce totaling million  acquired prior to july   based on a weighted average useful life of years 
we adopted sfas on march   the beginning of fiscal in conjunction with our adoption of sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill and are required to perform a transitional impairment test on all goodwill  totaling million as of march   during the first six months of fiscal year any impairment charges resulting from the initial application of the new rules will be classified as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operation 
in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes prior accounting standards concerning the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or the disposal of long lived assets and for the disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   we adopted sfas on march  the adoption of sfas will have an effect on the presentation of our results of operations in fiscal as we expect to complete the dissolution of emicro corporation during fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates  including bad debts  inventories  investments  long term assets  and income taxes 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
additionally  we may maintain and currently do maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on receivables from customers with whom we are involved in lengthy litigation 

inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on a first in  first out fifo basis 
we write down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and market conditions 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 

we evaluate the recoverability of property and equipment and intangible assets in accordance with sfas this standard requires recognition of impairment of long lived assets in the event the carrying value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
we adopted sfas and on march   the first day of fiscal 
we recognize revenue from products sold directly to customers and to international distributors upon title passage of inventory 
for sales made directly to domestic customers  title generally passes upon shipment 
for sales made directly to international customers and to international distributors  title generally passes at the port of destination 
sales made to domestic distributors are recorded as deferred revenue until the final sale to the end customer has occurred  since the distributor agreements allow certain rights of return and price protection on products unsold by distributors 
license and royalty revenue is recognized as it is earned per unit shipped or when a milestone is reached 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated with interest rates on our debt investment securities  equity price risk on investment securities  and currency movements on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities 
we assess these risks on a regular basis and have established policies to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses at march  actual results may differ materially 
interest rate risk at march   our cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash included short term  fixed rate securities 
an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on either the fair value of our investments or our results of operations 
equity price risk we are exposed to price risk on publicly traded equity investment securities 
a change in the value of the related securities would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange risk a majority of our revenue and spending is transacted in us dollars  however  we do enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily japanese yen through our japanese subsidiary 
we repatriate these amounts on a quarterly or monthly basis  depending on underlying accounts receivable collections 
we attempt to limit our exposure to changing foreign exchange rates through financial market instruments  principally through foreign exchange forward contracts 
the foreign exchange contracts are marked to market on a monthly basis based upon fluctuations of the underlying currency in relation to the us dollar  and the gains or losses are reflected in operations 
during fiscal and  we entered into various foreign currencies forward contracts to mitigate the foreign exchange risk of certain yen denominated net balance sheet accounts and sales 
as of march   we did not have any foreign exchange contracts outstanding 
as of march   we had foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding to purchase million at an average exchange rate of japanese yen per dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates on the value of open exchange contracts we may have from time to time  changes in exchange rates can also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales prices of our products
