inflation inflation can have a significant impact on the company s business performance and the homebuilding industry in general 
rising costs of land  materials  labor  overhead  administrative costs and interest rates on floating credit facilities can adversely affect the company s business performance 
in addition  rising costs of certain items  such as lumber  can adversely affect the expected profitability of the company s backlog 
generally  the company has been able to recover any increases in costs through increased selling prices 
however  there is no assurance the company will be able to continue to increase selling prices to cover the effects of inflation in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commitments certain off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commitments are disclosed in various sections of the consolidated financial statements  notes to consolidated financial statements  and below 
some typical off balance sheet arrangements commonly affecting homebuilders include o unconsolidated real estate joint ventures capital contribution requirements o debt and debt service guarantees o surety bonds and standby letters of credit o executed contracts for construction and development activity each of these items are described in detail below as they directly affect the company 
unconsolidated real estate joint ventures capital contribution requirements the company has developed and owned projects through joint ventures  accounted for using the equity method  with other parties in the past however  at the present time joint venture activities do not constitute a material portion of the company s operations 
the company currently does not have any unfunded commitments with respect to joint ventures 
debt and debt service guarantees at june   the company has mortgage and other note obligations on the balance sheet totaling  the company currently does not have any off balance sheet debt service guarantees 
surety bonds and standby letters of credit as of june   the company had  in surety bonds and  in outstanding standby letters of credit  totaling  in favor of local municipalities or financial institutions to guarantee the construction of real property improvements or financial obligations 
the  in surety bonds are to guarantee the construction of public improvements and infrastructure such as sewer  streets  traffic signals  grading  and wildlife preservations in connection with the company s various development projects 
surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from homebuilders such as the company and other real estate developers 
the surety bonds and standby letters of credit are renewable and expire upon completion of the required improvements 
standby letters of credit are a form of credit enhancement that is commonly required in real estate development when bonds are issued to finance public improvements 
in the past three years  no surety bonds or standby letters of credit have been used to satisfy the company s obligations 
executed contracts for site work and construction activity the company has entered into site work and construction contracts with various suppliers and contractors 
these contracts are for construction and development activity in the numerous communities the company has under development  and are originated in the normal course of business 
the site work contracts generally require specific performance by the contractor to prepare the land for construction and are written on a community by community basis 
for larger communities  site work contracts are awarded in phases  in order to limit any long term commitment by the company or its contractor 
generally  site work contracts are completed in less than one year 
the company acts as a general contractor and contracts with various subcontractors at specified prices for construction of its homes 
subcontractors generally work on a piece meal basis and are not awarded contracts for a specified number of homes 
these commitments are typically funded by construction loans and are originated in the normal course of business 
the following table summarizes the company s outstanding obligations as of june  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
for mortgage and other note obligations  payments due by period are shown based on the expiration date of the loan

critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements require the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  impairment of real estate assets  capitalization of costs  environmental liability exposure  miscellaneous litigation reserves  and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates reserves to reduce the company s real estate inventories to net realizable value are recorded using several factors including management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and projected cash flows  which include assumptions related to expected future demand and market conditions 
the adequacy of the company s reserves could be materially affected by changes in market conditions 
estimates for construction costs for homes closed are recorded in the period when the related home is closed 
these estimates are based on detailed budgets for each home and historical experience and trends 
if actual costs change  significant variances may be encountered 
reserves for the estimated cost of homes under warranty are recorded in the period in which the related home is closed and is based on historical experience and trends 
should actual warranty experience change  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
estimates for the costs to complete land development are recorded upon completion of the related land development project 
estimates for land and land development costs are allocated to development phases based on the total number of lots expected to be developed within each subdivision and are based on detailed budgets for the land development project and historical experience and trends 
if actual costs or total the number of lots developed changes  significant variances may be encountered 
revenue recognition revenue is primarily derived from residential property sales 
the company recognizes revenues from sales of residential properties at the time of closing 
the company also sells developed and undeveloped land in bulk and under option agreements 
revenues from sales of land and other real estate are recognized when the company has received an adequate cash down payment and all other conditions necessary for profit recognition have been satisfied 
to the extent that certain sales or portions thereof do not meet all conditions necessary for profit recognition  the company uses other methods to recognize profit  including the  percentage of completion  cost recovery and the deposit methods 
these methods of profit recognition defer a portion or all of the profit to the extent it is dependent upon the occurrence of future events 
also  in general  specific identification and relative sales value methods are used to determine the cost of sales 
management estimates of future costs to be incurred after the completion of each sale are included in cost of sales 
a change in circumstances that causes these estimates of future costs to increase or decrease significantly would affect the gain or loss recognized on future sales 
impairment the company assesses the impairment of real estate assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value may not be recoverable 
indicators the company consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the manner in which an asset is used  and an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to construct an asset 
real estate is stated at the lower of cost or estimated fair value using the methodology described as follows 
a write down to estimated fair value is recorded when the company determines that the net book value exceeds the estimated selling prices less cost to sell 
these evaluations are made on a property by property basis 
when the company determines that the net book value of an asset may not be recoverable based upon the estimated undiscounted cash flow  an impairment write down is recorded 
values from comparable property sales will also be considered 
the evaluation of future cash flows and fair value of individual properties requires significant judgment and assumptions  including estimates of market value  development absorption  and remaining development costs 
significant adverse changes in circumstances affecting these judgments and assumptions in future periods could cause a significant impairment adjustment to be recorded 
capitalization of costs costs capitalized include  direct construction and development costs  including predevelopment costs  interest on indebtedness  real estate taxes  insurance  construction overhead and indirect project costs 
costs previously capitalized related to any abandoned development opportunities are written off when it is determined such costs will not provide any future benefits 
any decrease in development activity may result in a portion of capitalized costs to be expensed as incurred 
environmental liability exposure development and sale of real property creates a potential for environmental liability on the part of the company as owner and developer  for its own acts as well as those of prior owners of the subject property or adjacent parcels 
if hazardous substances are discovered on or emanating from any of the company s properties  the company and prior owners  may be held liable for costs and liabilities relating to such hazardous substances 
environmental studies are generally undertaken in connection with property acquisitions by the company 
in the event the company incurs environmental remediation costs  including clean up costs  consulting fees for environmental studies and investigations  monitoring costs  and legal costs relating to clean up  litigation defense  and the pursuit of responsible third parties  such costs incurred in connection with properties previously sold are expensed 
costs relating to land under development and undeveloped land are capitalized as part of development costs 
costs incurred for properties to be sold are deferred and charged to cost of sales when the properties are sold 
should a previously undetected  substantial environmental hazard be found on the company s properties  significant liquidity could be consumed by the resulting clean up requirements and a material expense may be recorded 
further  governmental regulation on environmental matters affecting residential development could impose substantial additional expense to the company  which could adversely affect the results of operations of the company or the value of properties owned  or under contract of purchase by the company see item  legal proceedings  and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of specific environmental litigation 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  significant management judgment is required to estimate income taxes 
estimates are based on interpretation of tax laws 
the company estimates actual current tax due and assesses temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes 
adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities  and changes in tax laws 
to the extent adjustments are required in any given period the adjustments would be included within the tax provision in the statement of operations and or balance sheet 
these adjustments could materially impact the financial position and results of operation and liquidity of the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company  due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk in the area of interest rate changes 
a majority of the company s debt is variable rate based on libor and prime rate  and  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
based on current operations  an increase decrease in interest rates of basis points will result in a corresponding increase decrease in cost of sales and interest charges incurred by the company of approximately  in a fiscal year  a portion of which will be capitalized and included in cost of sales as homes are delivered 
generally  the company has in the past been able to increase prices to cover portions of any increase in cost of sales and interest charges incurred resulting from any increase in interest rates 
as a result  the company believes that reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates will not result in a material negative effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company
