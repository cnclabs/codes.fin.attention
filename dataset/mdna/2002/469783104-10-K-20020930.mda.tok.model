item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
recommends that all companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies used in the preparation of their financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
the company continuously evaluates a combination of historical results and anticipated future events to make assumptions and estimates related to its consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that given the current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimates methodologies would cause a material effect on the company s financial statements 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the accounting policies identified as critical are as follows valuation of receivables the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
the company continuously monitors payments from customers and a provision for estimated uncollectable amounts is maintained based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues  which have been identified 
while such uncollectable amounts have historically been within the company s expectations and provisions established  if a customer s financial condition were to deteriorate  additional reserves may be required 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally mitigated due to the large number of entities comprising the company s customer base  their dispersion across geographic areas and industries  along with the company s policy of maintaining credit insurance 
valuation of inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by using the first in  first out and average cost methods 
the company s inventories are comprised of high technology components sold to rapidly changing and competitive markets whereby such inventories may be subject to early technological obsolescence 
the company evaluates inventories for excess  obsolescence  or other factors rendering inventories as unsellable at normal gross profit margins 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate market value and take into account the company s contractual provisions with its suppliers governing price protections and stock rotations 
due to the large number of transactions and complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding the valuation of inventory at market value 
in addition  assumptions about future demand  market conditions  and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change and or actual market conditions are different than those projected by management  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
in any case  actual results may be different than those estimated 
goodwill and other intangible assets the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of acquired companies allocated to goodwill 
other intangible assets primarily represent a franchise agreement and non compete covenants 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to additional impairment tests whenever indicators of impairment are present  and at least annually 
other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over those useful lives 
we implemented sfas on july  sfas requires that the first of two impairment tests be completed within six months of adoption 
we performed a transitional fair value based impairment test during the second quarter of fiscal and determined that no impairment existed as of july  we evaluate long lived assets used in operations  including goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
the allocation of the acquisition cost to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on our future operating results as the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
an impairment review is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant industry or economic trends 
when impairment indicators are identified with respect to previously recorded intangible assets  the values of the assets are determined using discounted future cash flow techniques 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of the projected discounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and goodwill could occur 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items in our statement of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods shown net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating loss profit interest expense loss earnings before income taxes income tax benefit provision net loss earnings comparison of fiscal year ended june  fiscal with fiscal year ended june  fiscal net sales for fiscal were million  a decrease of  as compared to million for fiscal the electronics industry continues to be impacted by weak demand for components worldwide 
our customers have not increased their production to levels that will utilize the excess inventory maintained by such customers 
for fiscal flat panel display fpd sales represented approximately of our total distribution sales 
passive components represented approximately of our distribution sales and active components  including fpd s  represented approximately of our distribution sales during fiscal gross profit was million  or for fiscal  as compared to million  or for fiscal the fiscal gross profit includes inventory write downs of approximately million  of which approximately million was provided for in the fourth quarter of fiscal the gross profit margin decrease reflects both the continued pressure on component pricing due to weak demand throughout the industry allowing customers to negotiate lower prices and a higher percentage of sales of product that historically sells at lower margins 
we do not anticipate any material increase in our gross profit margin for the foreseeable future 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or compared to million in fiscal the decrease is attributable to a reduction in the number of employees  discretionary spending and a decrease in variable costs 
we have implemented a plan to reduce costs while business conditions do not improve 
variable costs have been reduced as a result of the reduction in sales and gross profit since most of our sales personnel receive a portion of their compensation based upon a percentage of gross profit 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal  representing a decrease of million  or 
the reduction reflects lower borrowing levels as a result of decreases in accounts receivable and inventory 
additionally  interest rates declined during the fiscal year 
we do not expect any substantial increase in borrowings for the foreseeable future to support operations 
net loss for fiscal was million  or 
per diluted share  compared to net earnings during fiscal of million  or per diluted share 
the net loss was primarily attributable to the weak condition of the electronics industry resulting in a decrease in net sales 
the reduction in net sales was partially offset by a decrease in sg a expenses and interest expense 
comparison of fiscal year ended june  with fiscal year ended june  fiscal net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of  as compared to million for fiscal our net sales benefited from both a strong demand for components throughout the electronics industry for the first six months and additional sales generated from the acquisition of interface electronics corp 
interface 
interface brought a new customer base as well as additional suppliers to sell to our existing customers 
during the last two quarters of fiscal  the demand for components was greatly reduced 
as a result  we experienced a decrease in sales sequentially 
gross profit was million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  compared to fiscal gross profit margins as a percentage of net sales were during fiscal compared to during fiscal the decrease in gross profit margins was as a result of the weakening in demand for electronic components toward the end of fiscal and an increase in semiconductor sales due to the new suppliers that were added by the acquisition of interface 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  sg a  expenses decreased in fiscal to compared to in fiscal the increase in spending is attributable to higher staffing levels that was required to support the increase in net sales  an increase in variable costs such as commissions paid to sales personnel  and the additional costs associated with the acquisition of interface 
the decrease in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales reflects operating efficiencies realized by higher sales 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the additional borrowings needed for the acquisition of interface  and capital required due to the increase in accounts receivable and inventory that were necessary to support the growth in sales 
net earnings for fiscal were million  or per share diluted compared to net earnings for fiscal of million  or per share diluted 
the increase in net earnings was attributable to the increase in net sales  the operating efficiencies realized by the increase in net sales  and the successful integration of interface during the fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources our agreement with our banks  as amended  expires on march  as part of the amendment  the line of credit facility was reduced from million to million 
this reflects our lower borrowing requirements 
the credit facility is based principally on eligible accounts receivable and inventories as defined in the agreement 
the interest rate on the credit facility was based on the average day libor rate plus to for the fiscal year ended june  as amended  effective october   the rate will convert to the average day libor rate plus to 
the agreement  as amended as of september   contains provisions for the maintenance of certain financial covenants and prohibits the payment of cash dividends 
the agreement also provided a waiver for non compliance on one of the financial covenants 
the outstanding balance on the credit facility was million at june  for fiscal  our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  as compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for the same period last fiscal year 
the increase in net cash provided is primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable and inventory 
the decrease in accounts receivable and inventory was the result of the decrease in net sales for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to the same period last year 
net cash used in investing activities decreased to million for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease is primarily attributable to deferred payments related to the acquisition of interface electronics corp 
of million for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  net cash used in financing activities was million for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the comparable period last fiscal year 
the increase in net cash used is primarily attributable to the decrease in the outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit facility from million as of june  to million as of june   which was a result of the decreases in accounts receivable and inventory 
for fiscal and fiscal  our inventory turnover was x and x  respectively 
the average days outstanding of our accounts receivable at june  was days  as compared to days at june  we believe that cash flow from operations and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our capital needs for the foreseeable future 
however  our cash expenditures may vary significantly from current levels  based on a number of factors  including  but not limited to future acquisitions  if any 
historically  we have been able to obtain amendments to our existing credit facility to satisfy financial covenants 
while there can be no assurances that such financing or future amendment if needed  will be available  management believes we will be able to continue to obtain financing on acceptable terms 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the last three fiscal years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes with respect to our credit facility which bears interest at the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus  or at our option  at a rate equal to the average day libor rate plus to depending on our performance for the immediately preceding four fiscal quarters measured by a certain financial ratio  and may be adjusted quarterly 
at august   million was outstanding under the credit facility 
changes in the libor interest rate during fiscal will have a positive or negative effect on our interest expense 
each fluctuation in the libor interest rate will increase or decrease interest expense for us by approximately million based on outstanding borrowings at august  the impact of interest rate fluctuations on other floating rate debt is not material
