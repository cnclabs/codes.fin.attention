item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of operations and financial condition of lifecell should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
special note certain statements set forth below constitute forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of see business special note regarding forward looking statements and business risk factors 
in the following discussions  most percentages and dollar amounts have been rounded to aid the presentation 
as a result  all such figures are approximations 
general and background we develop and market biologically based solutions for the repair and replacement of damaged or inadequate human tissue in numerous different clinical applications 
our core tissue matrix technology removes all cells from the tissue and preserves the tissue without damaging the essential biochemical and structural components necessary for normal tissue regeneration 
we currently market four human tissue based products alloderm r for plastic reconstructive  burn and periodontal procedures  cymetra tm  a version of alloderm r in particulate form for non surgical correction of soft tissue defects  repliform tm  a version of alloderm r for urology and gynecology procedures  and cryopreserved allograft skin for use as a temporary dressing in the treatment of burns 
our development programs include the potential application of our tissue matrix technology to vascular  nerve and orthopedic tissue  investigation of human tissues as carriers for therapeutics  thrombosol tm  a formulation for extended storage of platelets and technologies to enhance the storage of red blood cells for transfusion 
critcal accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to the understanding of our financial statements 
the application of these polices requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the valuation of assets and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  beginning on page f accounts receivable 
we maintain a provision for estimated bad debt losses on our accounts receivables based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
in addition  we perform ongoing credit evaluations and monitor collections and payments from our customers 
since our accounts receivable are not concentrated within a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers will not have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivables and our future operating results 
while losses depend to a large degree on future economic conditions  management does not forecast significant bad debt losses in inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
we record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on inventory quantities on hand  our historical product sales  estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
although we believe current inventory reserves are adequate  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our future operating results 
results of operations years ended december  and total revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million in the increase was principally attributable to a increase in product revenues to million in the current year as compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in product revenues was largely due to increased demand for repliform and alloderm 
repliform revenues increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in alloderm revenues increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the same period in cymetra revenues contributed million in compared to million in cymetra unit demand increased slightly  however revenues decreased due to a reduction in the average per unit selling price 
boston scientific corporation is our exclusive worldwide sales and marketing representative for repliform for use in the urology and gynecology markets and omp  inc is the exclusive sales and marketing representative of cymetra for office based dermatologists and plastic surgeons 
during  sales of our products through boston scientific corporation and omp represented and  respectively  of our total product revenues compared to and  respectively  in both boston scientific and omp are paid agency fees based on the amount of product revenues they generate for us 
such fees are recorded as selling and marketing expenses 
total revenue was also impacted by a decrease in funded research grant revenues which totaled million in compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in research spending on projects funded by research grants  since research grant revenues are recognized as qualified expenses are incurred 
during  we were awarded two grants from the department of defense totaling million to investigate the application of our acellular tissue matrix technology to the regeneration of orthopedic  vascular and nerve tissues 
as of december   approximately million of approved grant funding was available to fund further research and development expenses through cost of products sold for the year ended december  was million  or of product revenues  compared to cost of products sold of million  or for the same period in the cost of products sold as a percentage of sales remained unchanged for the year 
certain efficiencies realized in manufacturing cost  as a result of volume increases and process improvements  were offset by a reduction in the average selling price of cymetra 
total research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the decrease was due primarily to a reduction in expenditures for cymetra product development related to the product launch in general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in general and administrative expenses were higher in because they included recruiting expenses and other employee related costs associated with hiring new employees in conjunction with our relocation from texas to new jersey and settlement costs and legal fees associated with the settlement of litigation with inamed corporation 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the same period in the increase in compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in agency fees earned by our independent marketing agents for the distribution of repliform and cymetra  partially offset by a reduction in promotion expenses 
interest and other income expense  net increased  for the year ended december  compared to the net increase was due to a  increase in interest expense and a  decline in interest income resulting from lower average interest rates during the period 
the net loss for the year ended december  decreased to million compared to million in the decrease in net loss in compared to was principally due to higher product revenues and the decrease in general and administrative expenses discussed above 
preferred stock and deemed dividends increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in preferred stock dividends decreased in to  from  as series b preferred stockholders were entitled to receive dividends through september  in  the company recorded a non cash deemed dividend of million in connection with issuance of additional shares and repricing of warrants to an investor pursuant to the terms of an investment in years ended december  and total revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in product revenues to million in as compared to million in the increase in product revenues was largely due to the full commercial launch of repliform in january and cymetra in june repliform and cymetra product sales contributed million and million  respectively  in total revenue was further impacted by an increase in funded research grant revenues of million from  in this increase was primarily due to an increase in research grant funding available 
cost of products sold for the year ended december  was million  or of product revenues  compared to cost of goods sold of million  or for the same period in the increase in costs as a percentage of product revenue was principally attributable to increased costs associated with the expansion of tissue processing capacity in our new facility and costs incurred in related to the scale up of cymetra production 
total research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the increase was due primarily to higher expenditures for cymetra product development and technology transfer to commercial production and increased spending on orthopedic program research  which is funded through a research grant 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the increase was principally due to a combination of increased professional fees  higher salary costs relating to the hiring of management personnel during the second half of which continued for the full year  and  of settlement costs and legal fees associated with the settlement of the lawsuit with inamed corporation  all of which were incurred in selling and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel during the second half of which continued for the full year  increased promotion expenses associated with the expansion of marketing activities including the commercial launch of two new products and the agency fees associated with the sales and marketing agreements with boston scientific and omp 
during the year ended december   in connection with the relocation of our operations from texas to new jersey  we incurred million of relocation costs consisting principally of non relocating employee benefits  asset abandonment costs and costs to relocate key employees 
relocation costs for the year ended december   were  consisting of  of retention bonus and  of relocation costs  which were included in cost of goods sold and general and administrative expenses  respectively 
the relocation from texas to new jersey was completed in june interest and other income expense  net decreased  for the year ended december  compared to the net decrease was due to a  decline in interest income resulting from a lower cash balance available for investment and a  increase in interest expense resulting from an increase in revolving and long term debt 
the net loss for the year ended december  decreased to million compared to million in as discussed above  the net loss in the prior year included million of expenses associated with our relocation from texas to new jersey 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million compared to million at the end of in july  we received million in net proceeds from the private placement of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
approximately million of the net proceeds were used to satisfy the entire outstanding balance on our revolving loan facility 
in addition  a portion of the proceeds were used to fund the operating loss for the year ended december   reduce accounts payable and accrued liabilities  acquire capital assets and service debt 
working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase resulted principally from decreases in notes payable  accounts payable  and accrued liabilities net of decreases in cash and accounts receivable 
our operating activities used net cash of million for the year ended december  to fund our operating loss for the period  net of non cash charges  and decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
our investing activities used net cash of  for the year ended december  for the purchase of capital equipment and additions to patents 
our financing activities provided net cash of million for the year ended december  in july  we completed the private placement of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
net proceeds from the offering were million 
we used million of the proceeds to satisfy the entire outstanding balance on our revolving loan facility 
during  we also used million in cash to reduce the principal balance on our term debt 
the following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by period less than one total year to years to years after years long term debt      operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      under our debt agreements  the maturity of our outstanding debt could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain covenants 
we believe that our current cash resources together with anticipated product revenues and committed research and development grant funding will be sufficient to finance our planned operations  research and development programs and fixed asset requirements through however  there can be no assurance that such sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our needs and as a result  we may need additional funding 
in august  we voluntarily terminated our million revolving loan facility and currently we have no additional borrowing availability through our existing credit facilities or commitments for any future funding 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding from either debt or equity financing  bank loans  collaborative arrangements or other sources on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we expect that we will be required to delay  scale back or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve significant restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish our rights to certain of our technologies  products or marketing territories 
it is possible that our results of operations or liquidity and capital resources could be adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of pending litigation or as a result of the cost of contesting such legal actions 
for a discussion of these matters see note of notes to financial statements and part i  item legal proceedings 
at december   there were  shares of common stock outstanding that are subject to redemption by us under certain conditions 
these shares were issued to one investor in a private placement in november pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  if we do not maintain a listing on or quotation of our shares of common stock on a us stock exchange or market system we will be required to redeem such shares at per share or million in the aggregate 
we have incurred losses since our inception and therefore have not been subject to federal income taxes 
as of december   we had net operating loss nol and research and development tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of million and  respectively  available to reduce future federal income taxes 
federal tax laws provide for a limitation on the use of nol and tax credit carryforwards generated prior to certain ownership changes that could limit our ability to use nol and tax credit carryforwards 
our public offering of common stock in resulted in an ownership change for federal income tax purposes 
we estimate that the amount of nol carryforwards and the credits available to offset federal taxable income subsequent to the ownership change are million on a cumulative basis 
accordingly  if we generate taxable income in any year in excess of the then cumulative limitation  we may be required to pay federal income taxes even though we have unexpired nol carryforwards 
in addition  we have nol s available for state income tax purposes of approximately million  available to reduce future state income taxes 
in march  the company realized  through the sale and transfer of million of state tax net operating losses 
the sale and transfer was made through the technology business tax certificate program sponsored by the new jersey economic development authority 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our debt arrangements and  secondarily  from our investments in certain securities 
although our short term investments are available for sale  we generally hold such investments until maturity 
we do not utilize derivative instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we believe that a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december
