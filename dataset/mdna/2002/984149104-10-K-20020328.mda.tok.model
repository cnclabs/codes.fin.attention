the mobile assistant ma series is the company s primary wearable computer hardware product line  with the mobile assistant iv the ma iv  ma v and ma tc currently available 
since its introduction in december  the company has realized revenue of over  on sales of approximately  units of the ma iv  the company s prior model  through december  the company began shipping the poma  a wearable computer targeted at the light commercial and near consumer markets  during the first quarter of the company derives its revenues from sales of its wearable computers  software products and consulting services 
in the future  the company expects to obtain additional revenues from the licensing of its intellectual property 
a number of trends are expected to have a significant effect on the company s operations in the future 
during  many of the company s large customers deferred or delayed anticipated purchases of company products because of uncertain economic conditions 
if those conditions worsen  it is possible that more potential customers will defer or delay purchases  which would have an adverse effect on company operations 
while the company expects general economic conditions to improve beginning in the second quarter of  there can be no assurance that this expectation will be realized 
beginning with the widespread use of the internet on desktop computers  there has been an increasing demand for mobile computing and wireless communications devices that can bring this desktop internet experience to mobile users 
the rapid growth of internet enabled cell phones  pdas  interactive pagers and the like result in a growing number of devices that cater to the mobile data user and which may compete with the company s products and which may also present opportunities for licensing 
the company believes that sales of its wearable computers will rely to a great extent on the availability of wireless broadband services that can take advantage of the processing power and display capabilities of the company s hardware products 
wireless lans are now well established in the commercial markets for providing broadband capabilities in limited range applications such as warehouses  factory floors  flightline operations and the like 
however  widerange wireless access  commonly referred to as g or g  is not established at this time  but is expected in the near future 
the company believes that the consumer markets will require such wireless broadband access to fully develop 
critical accounting policies in accounting for the financial results of the company s operations  management employs several critical accounting methods and policies and makes estimates and assumptions which materially affect the manner in which such results are presented 
the company s critical accounting policies are as follows inventory and tooling 
inventory consists primarily of wearable computer component parts held for resale and allocated tooling costs  and is primarily comprised of finished goods 
the capitalized tooling asset consists of payments made to third party vendors for their products and services that are used in the manufacture of the company s proprietary hardware products 
periodically  the company records charges and reserves against its inventory and tooling asset balances 
to determine the sizes of the charges and reserves to record  if any  management reviews the carrying value of its inventory and tooling in light of the introduction of new and competing product lines  its ability to sell the quantities of inventory on hand and the sales prices it ultimately expects to achieve 
this analysis takes into account estimated price concessions which management believes are likely to be necessary in disposing of this inventory 
as a result of this review  it may be determined that certain of the company s inventory is slow moving  risks becoming obsolete or may likely be sold at below historical cost 
based upon a specific review of the carrying costs for the inventory items  management estimates the quantity of each inventory item that the company expects to be able to sell and  if appropriate  quantifies inventory amounts that may not be recoverable 
subsequent to recording such charges and reserves  if any  management does not expect to record significant profits or losses upon the ultimate sale of this inventory 
this review is based on a number of assumptions and estimates made by management  including but not limited to those related to the introduction of new product lines  the company s ability to sell the quantities of inventory on hand  the net sales price the company ultimately expects to achieve  the introduction of competing products  customer demand and general economic conditions 
to the extent that actual future events are different from the assumptions and estimates used by management  additional charges  reserves or adjustments may be recorded by the company 
the capitalized tooling asset is systematically allocated to inventory and property and equipment and is amortized as a component of cost of sales or depreciation based upon the number of units sold or used as demonstration units in a given period compared to the total number of units management expects to make in a product s production run 
management s expectation of the number of units to be made during a given product s production run is based on a number of assumptions and estimates  including but not limited to those related to the introduction of new product lines  the company s ability to procure and sell the quantities of inventory  the introduction of competing products  customer demand and general economic conditions 
to the extent that actual future events are different from the assumptions and estimates used by management  additional charges  reserves or adjustments may be recorded by the company 
patents 
the company capitalizes legal fees  filing fees and other direct costs incurred to obtain patents and trademarks 
these costs are amortized over a five year period 
the costs of maintaining patents are expensed as incurred 
whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that there is the potential for the impairment of the carrying values of these patent assets  management performs an analysis to determine the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
as a result of such analysis  management may reserve against or write down the carrying value of the patent asset 
this review is based on a number of assumptions and estimates made by management  including but not limited to those related to the outcome of potential litigation against competitors who may infringe on the company s patents  the outcome of potential litigation brought against the company related to infringement of another company s patents  impairment of trade secrets and know how and the company s intentions to use a given patent in the future 
to the extent that actual future events are different from the assumptions and estimates used by management  additional charges  reserves or adjustments may be recorded by the company 
warranties for hardware product sales 
for hardware product sales  the company generally provides a one year warranty on its parts and a six month warranty on labor 
the company s suppliers for the significant components of the ma and poma product lines  including the computing units  flat panel and head mounted displays  and batteries  provide the company with similar warranties 
in certain instances  the company offers extended warranties for up to two years beyond the standard one year warranty 
the company is in negotiations with its suppliers to offer similar warranties to the company to back up the extended warranties offered to the company s customers 
a provision for estimated future warranty costs is recorded at the time of shipment as a component of cost of sales 
this warranty expense is recorded based on the expected costs to be incurred by the company above and beyond the warranty provisions provided to the company by its vendors 
the expense is recorded by management using a number of assumptions and estimates  including but not limited to those related to estimates for future warranty claims based on reviews of historical warranty experience as well as other general and customer specific factors  industry warranty trends  intended uses by customers  successful negotiation of extended warranty coverage from the company s vendors and continued warranty support from vendors 
additionally  because of the recent introduction of the ma v  ma tc and poma product lines  the company only has limited historical data on which to forecast future warranty claims 
to the extent that actual future event are different from the assumptions and estimates used by management  additional warranty expenses may be recorded by the company 
revenue recognition on fixed price contracts 
the company recognizes revenue from long term service contracts in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 
 long term construction type contracts  using the relevant guidance in statement of position sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  as determined by the terms and conditions of the company s various consulting contracts with its customers 
revenue is recognized in fixed price contracts based on the percentage of completion method by calculating the ratio of costs incurred over total estimated costs to complete 
historically  the company has not recorded losses related to its fixed price contracts 
however  in the event that the costs to complete increase  or are anticipated to increase  to a level that will result in a negative gross margin to the company  a loss is recognized in the period that this determination is made 
possible events that could cause the total estimated costs to complete a project to change include  but are not limited to  the occurrence of unanticipated complications  technical or otherwise  changes to a client s requirements  general inefficiencies in the management of the engagement  a change in key personnel or the cost of personnel

the company intends to pursue cost reductions for future production runs of the poma  along with bundling services with the product sale  to generate industry standard margins from the poma 
although the poma inventory had not been received by the company as of december   the company recorded the expected losses during  which was the period in which the underlying contracts were entered into

the ibm revolver provides for up to  in borrowings based on the company s base of eligible us receivables and inventory

the borrowing is secured by the company s us assets  excluding patents and intellectual property 
the ibm revolver includes customary financial covenants and other restrictions  including the requirement that the company obtain a  irrevocable letter of credit the letter of credit to secure this facility

subject to the satisfaction of the various requirements of the facility  the company expects to draw down on the ibm revolver during commitments inventory 
at december   the company had commitments to purchase inventory  tooling and engineering and other services from its suppliers and manufacturers related to its current hardware product lines 
the company is currently obligated to purchase certain components of the ma v system from ibm  including approximately  computing units the ma v cpus 
the ma v cpus are scheduled for purchase over an month period following final acceptance by the company  which acceptance is determined by a number of criteria  including receipt of comprehensive product documentation and other defined deliverables 
all criteria for acceptance had not been met at the time of this filing  but the company expects that all criteria will likely be met in the first half of subsequent to acceptance  the company may cancel its purchase commitment by paying a cancellation fee in an amount not to exceed approximately  and that decreases in proportion to the number of ma v cpus purchased over the contract period 
the company is currently in discussions with ibm to defer a portion of these commitments to future generations of the ma series and other services  which would extend the timing required for the company to meet these commitments 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in renegotiating this commitment 
in addition to the obligation related to the ma v cpus  the company has commitments to purchase computing units  flat panel and head mounted displays  miscellaneous computing components as well as engineering and other services from its various vendors related to the ma v  poma  ma tc and future product lines 
the company believes that the timing and amount of many of these shipments  services and payments may be adjusted through the payment of cancellation fees  contract negotiations or the satisfaction of obligations through the issuance of the company s equity securities 
however  there can be no assurance that the company can successfully modify these contracts or commitments 
excluding the potential impact of contract modifications  the company estimates that it will make total payments of  during related to inventory commitments for the current product lines under which the company was obligated as of december  the company estimates that it will make additional payments totaling  during and  during related to inventory commitments for the current product lines under which the company anticipates it will obligate itself in order to execute its business plan for and otherwise complete its current commitments

during the initial two year term  the company is required to pay  and issue  shares of the company s common stock 
other liquidity and capital resources disclosures at december   the company had accounts receivable  net of allowances  of  a decrease of  or  from the december  balance of  this fluctuation was roughly in line with the increase in total revenues from to and was not caused by qualitative factors related to the company s business such as changes in credit terms  slower paying customers or the impact of a change in economic environment 
at december   the company had deferred  in revenue associated with shipments of its hardware products pursuant to sales contracts which included provisions for future upgrades of its products 
the company recognized this deferred revenue during as the upgraded products were shipped to the customers 
the remaining deferred revenue balances at december  and result primarily from billings to customers that were in excess of revenue recognized on service contracts 
such deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue as the revenue recognition criteria are met 
the company has incurred operating losses to date and expects such losses to continue in the near term as it expands its product development and marketing efforts 
at december   the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately  the achievement of profitability is primarily dependent upon the continued development and commercial acceptance of the company s products  the successful management of the business  the ability to profitably sell the company s wearable computer products  and management s ability to reduce or minimize operating expenses relative to the growth in revenues and strategically focus the company 
there can be no assurance as to whether or when profitable operations will occur 
in addition  the company is experiencing negative cash flow from operations and it is expected that it will continue to experience negative cash flows through and potentially thereafter 
the company anticipates that its working capital requirements and operating expenses  without the restructuring and cost reduction program discussed below  will increase as the company expands production of its current wearable computer product lines  develops new models  further expands its sales  service and marketing functions  and develops the support structure for these activities 
the timing of increases in personnel and other expenses  the amount of working capital consumed by operations  inventory procurement  marketing and rollout expenses for the mobile assistant series and other products  and competitive pressures on gross margins will impact the magnitude and timing of the company s cash requirements 
during march  the company s executive management performed a detailed review of operations and made recommendations to the president of the company to significantly restructure the company and reduce the company s operating expenses 
the president retains the sole authority to act on these recommendations and has initiated this restructuring program with the intent of completing the program by june assuming there are no significant changes to the company s business plan  management estimates that savings of approximately to from annualized fourth quarter levels  or savings of approximately million to million per annum  can be achieved once these steps are fully implemented 
even after the above cost cutting initiatives are implemented  the company will still be required to obtain outside financing to supplement the company s cash position 
management is currently exploring financing alternatives to supplement the company s cash position 
potential sources of additional financing include private equity offerings  strategic investments  strategic partnerships and various forms of debt financing 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of ownership of current stockholders of the company will be reduced 
if additional funds are raised through borrowings  the company will be subject to additional interest charges and principal repayments and will most likely be required to comply with financial covenants or other restrictions 
in march  the company raised  in cash through sales of its common stock to institutional investors 
the equity markets  especially for small capitalization technology stocks  have remained depressed  and the us and world economies have generally been in a decline or recession 
if a sustained decline in the general equity markets  the price of the company s common stock  or the us or world economy were to occur  the company could face difficulties in its ability to raise additional capital 
additionally  the company has historically made several private placements of its common stock per year  primarily to institutional investors who specialize in making similar types of investments 
if these institutional investors were to choose to not participate in future private placements  the company could face difficulties in its ability to raise additional capital 
a decline in the company s stock price to below per share could also have a significant negative impact on the company s ability to raise capital through equity financings and also negatively impact the company s nasdaq national listing for its common stock 
the company s management believes that the combination of cash on hand  cash flows from operations  and outside funding will provide sufficient liquidity to meet the company s ongoing cash requirements  based both on its historical ability to raise capital and on debt and equity financings currently available to the company 
however  there can be no assurance that the company can or will obtain sufficient funds from operations or from closing additional financings on terms acceptable to the company 
if the company is unable to obtain sufficient additional financing  it will be required to reduce discretionary spending in order to maintain its operations at a reduced level 
management believes that it will be able to reduce discretionary spending if required 
however  such reduction would negatively impact progress on implementing the company s business plan  and would require substantial reductions in the purchase commitments previously disclosed herein

historically  the company has not realized significant gains or losses in transactions denominated in  or determined by  foreign currencies 
to date  the company has not entered into foreign exchange forward or option contracts to hedge its exposure to future movements in foreign exchange rates because the company s management believes that the potential impact of these movements does not justify the costs of entering into such contracts or the use of capital to collateralize these contracts 
as international sales and operations increase in the future  the company may enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge transactions denominated in a foreign currency

if additional funds are raised through borrowings  the company will be subject to additional interest charges and is most likely to be required to comply with financial covenants or other restrictions 
interest rate increases may materially increase the company s interest expense  hinder the company s ability to borrow additional funds or have a negative effect on the ability of the company s customers to purchase its products 
required financial covenants may also hinder the company s ability to expand or change its business operations 
to date  the company has not entered into interest rate forward or option contracts to hedge its exposure to future movements in interest rates because the company s management believes that the potential impact of these movements does not justify the costs of entering into such contracts or the use of capital to collateralize these contracts
