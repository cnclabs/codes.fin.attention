and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual future activities and results of operations to be materially different from that set forth in the forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ include  among others  risks associated with affiliations  fluctuations in operating results because of affiliations and variations in stock price  changes in government regulations  competition  risks of operations and growth of existing affiliated dental practices  risks related to the company s ability to continue as a going concern and risks detailed in edt learning s sec filings 
overview headquartered in phoenix  arizona  edt learning is a leading provider of custom  comprehensive e learning business solutions for corporate clients seeking to train non technical users individuals with less computer experience 
the company supports organizations requiring internal training  product demonstration and customer education programs with the goal of mapping e learning solutions to business results 
history the company began in march of as a dental practice management company under the name pentegra dental group  inc its formation included the simultaneous rollup of dental practices and an initial public offering raising million in initial capital 
the company s initial goals were to provide training and practice enhancement services to its affiliated dental practices spread over states 
as early as the company delivered proprietary learning systems communication to its remote affiliated offices through its user interface and database driven communication system that employed the internet and browser technology 
the company subsequently shifted its focus away from the dental practice management industry and toward the e learning sector in the summer of and changed its name to edt learning  inc now trading as amex edt 
beginning in april of  the company modified the affiliated service agreements with its affiliated dental practices to provide for a fixed fee  limited practice management services and a reduction in the agreement term from years to five years 
commensurate with that change in fiscal  the company recorded a one time million charge against earnings related to the elimination of goodwill previously associated with those affiliated service agreements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer contracts  bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company recognizes revenue and profit as work progresses on learning contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
the company follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
customers sometimes request modifications to projects in progress which may result in significant revisions to cost estimates and profit recognition  and the company may not be successful in negotiating additional payments related to the changes in scope of requested services 
provisions for any estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses become evident 
there were no such losses at march the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company has made acquisitions of companies having operations or technology in areas within its strategic focus and has recorded goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the acquisitions 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying acquired operations could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
as of march   no such impairment has been identified by the company 
the company has recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of its net deferred tax assets because it has concluded that it is not likely it will be recognized due to the lack of operating history and implementation of its learning business plan and the modification of its management service agreements 
the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations as an extension of its educational and training background  the company has broadened its reach to focus on the larger growing e learning and corporate training market 
with the launch of the company s state of the art learning management system and its e learning engine  the company now provides a comprehensive array of e learning content  hosting and delivery services to corporations  inside and outside the dental and healthcare industries 
the company s synchronous and asynchronous content delivery solutions provide an array of e learning products that are customized to each corporate client 
the company is positioning itself in the corporate training sector of the e learning marketplace leveraging its existing infrastructure and using scale provided by an integrated product 
in connection with the execution of its e learning strategy  the company acquired two companies during the year ended march   learning edge and thoughtware technologies  inc on october   the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of learning edge  inc  an arizona based private e learning company 
the company issued  common shares and million of debt under the terms of the acquisition agreement

at march   and  the company had service agreements with  and practices in  and states respectively

these risks include the fact that the market for e learning products and services is in the early stages of development and may not grow to a sufficient size or at a sufficient rate to sustain the company s business 
the company also faces intense competition from other e learning providers and may be unable to compete successfully 
many of the company s existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  technical and other resources and therefore may be able to more quickly respond to changing opportunities or customer requirements 
new competitors are also likely to enter this market in the future due to the lack of significant barrier to entry in the market share

recent accounting prouncements in june  the financial accounting standard board issued sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets which established standards for reporting acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement accounts for goodwill based on the reporting units of the combined entity into which an acquired entity is integrated 
in accordance with the statement  goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level and the amortization period of intangible assets with finite lives will not be limited to forty years 
the provisions of this statement are required to be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after december  with early application permitted for entities with fiscal years beginning after march  the statement is also effective for business combinations subsequent to june   whether or not the statement has been adopted in full 
the company has million of goodwill included in its balance sheet at march  of this balance  million relates to acquisitions closed subsequent to june   and is not being amortized 
goodwill amortization for the year ended march  was  before the provisions of sfas were applied 
implementation of sfas by the company would result in elimination of amortization of goodwill from acquisition under the purchase method of accounting 
the statement does not result in the elimination of amortization of the company s service agreements because under the scope of the statement only goodwill resulting from acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting  and not other identifiable intangible assets  is subject to being no longer amortized 
sfas requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment and  in transition  this stop must be measured as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
however  a company has six months from the date of adoption to complete the first step 
the company expects to complete that first step of the goodwill impairment test during the first quarter of fiscal the second step of the goodwill impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss measured as of the beginning of the year of adoption  if any  and must be completed by the end of the company s fiscal year 
intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life will be tested for impairment using a one step process  which compares the fair value to the carrying amount of the asset as of the beginning of the fiscal year and pursuant to the requirements of sfas will be completed during the first quarter of fiscal any impairment loss resulting from the transitional impairment test will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal the company has not yet determined what effect these impairment tests will have on the company s earnings and financial position 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associates with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associates asset retirement costs

in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets which establishes one accounting model to be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not anticipate any financial statement impact with the adoption of this statement 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 recession of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
includes among other things  the rescission of sfas no 
 which required that gains and losses from early extinguishments of debt be classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effects 
under the new guidance of sfas no 
 losses from early extinguishments of debt will be classified as extraordinary items when the losses are considered unusual in nature and infrequent in occurrence 
sfas no 
will be effective for the company on april  liquidity and capital resources the company changed its business model from a dental practice management company to an e learning company in the first quarter of fiscal the company is currently implementing its e learning strategy  has a limited operating history with regard to its e learning business and is continuing the development and enhancement of its e learning product and service offerings and related revenue streams 
the company acquired two e learning entities during and one e learning company subsequent to year end and is currently integrating the operations of these entities 
the company reported a working capital deficit and negative cash flow from operations for fiscal year also  the company s management service agreements with the affiliated dental practices begin to expire on april  and will continue to expire through december   which will reduce revenues and cash flow from this source and accordingly could negatively affect the company s liquidity and operating results 
these items discussed above and the limited operating history as an e learning company raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
management s plan with regard to these matters include continued development  marketing and licensing of its e learning products and services through both internal growth and acquisition 
although management continues to pursue these plans  there is no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining sufficient revenues from its products and services to provide adequate cash flows to sustain operations 
in order to increase its liquidity  the company has developed a plan consisting of the following strategies  i continued implementation of its e learning based strategic business plan through both internal growth and acquisition and ii acceleration of cash collections from affiliated dental practices by offering a sale of the dental practices management service agreements earlier than contractually required 
the company has made other acquisitions  and management expects that other e learning businesses will be acquired in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates and their owners  or that the company will be able to profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate such additional businesses into the company at all  or without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
there can be no assurance that businesses acquired will achieve sales and profitability that justify the investment made by the company 
any inability on the part of the company to control these risks effectively and integrate and manage acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on the company 
acquisitions may result in increased depreciation and amortization expense  increase interest expense  increased financial leverage or decrease operating results 
the company s service agreements with affiliated dental practices begin to expire on march  and will continue to expire through december   which will reduce revenues and cash flow from this source and accordingly could negatively affect the company s liquidity and operating results 
during fiscal  the company received million in cash from terminating the service agreements with affiliated practices

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we have not traded or otherwise bought and sold derivatives nor do we expect to in the future 
we also do not invest in market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
the primary objective of the company s investment activity is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  the company maintains its portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of money market funds 
as of march   the carrying value of our outstanding convertible redeemable subordinated notes was approximately million at a fixed interest rate of 
in certain circumstances  we may redeem this long term debt 
our other components of indebtness bear fixed interest rates of to 
because the interest rates on these instruments are fixed  a hypothetical change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition  revenues or operations 
increases in interest rates could  however  increase the interest expense associated with future borrowings  if any 
we do not hedge against interest rate increases
