as used herein  the terms fiscal  fiscal and fiscal refer to our fiscal years ended september   september  and september   respectively 
application of critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue related to our merchandise sales at the time of sale  reduced by a provision for returns 
we estimate this returns provision principally based on prior year return rates 
payments from customers on our layaway program are recorded as a liability until the customer fulfills the terms of the layaway 
once the customer completes the terms of the layaway program  including taking receipt of the merchandise  a sale is recognized 
finance charges and credit insurance revenues excluding credit property insurance are earned based on the declining principal of each contract using the interest method 
credit property insurance revenues are recorded on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
product warranties are recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated warranty period 
we periodically review the estimated term of product warranties and may adjust the estimated term over which our product warranty revenue is recognized based on actual trends and experience 
the effect of our estimation may be an increase or decrease in our warranty revenue and  as a result  a corresponding increase or decrease in our net sales 
we classify finance charges  credit insurance and other credit service revenues as a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses 
accounts receivable 
approximately of our merchandise sales are made under installment contracts due in periodic payments over periods typically ranging from three to months 
accounts receivable is comprised of purchased merchandise  finance charges  credit insurance  product warranties and late fees  less unearned finance charges  product warranties  credit insurance and our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we follow industry practice and include amounts due after one year in current assets 
we conduct credit approval and collection procedures at each store and follow internal company guidelines to evaluate the credit worthiness of our customers and to manage the collection process 
in order to minimize our credit risk  we generally require down payments on credit sales and offer credit insurance to our customers 
we believe that we are not dependent on a given industry or business for our customer base  and  therefore  have no significant concentration of credit risk 
we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
we estimate the reserve each quarter based on historical experience  the composition of outstanding balances  credit experience trends and other relevant information 
the application of this methodology may result in increases or decreases in our provision for uncollectible accounts from quarter to quarter 
our policy is generally to write off in full any credit account receivable if no payments have been received for days and any other credit accounts receivable  regardless of payment history  if judged uncollectible for example  in the event of fraud in the credit application or bankruptcy 
we contract with collection agencies on a contingent fee basis to collect accounts previously written off 
upon write off of an account  we record as a receivable an estimate of the amount to be recovered by the collection agencies based on our historical experience 
such amounts  currently of amounts written off  are included in other current assets and are credited to the allowance for uncollectible accounts 
we do not require separate collateral to secure credit purchases made by our customers  but we do retain a security interest in the purchased item 
store opening and closing costs 
we expense store opening costs when incurred 
we determine our store closing costs  consisting of fixed asset impairment charges and accruals for remaining lease obligations  and recognize these costs in the period in which we make the decision that a store will be closed 
we then close the store shortly thereafter 
indicators of impairment generally do not exist with respect to our property and equipment except in circumstances of store closings 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain percentage relationships based on our consolidated income statements for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended september  net sales cost of goods sold including occupancy  distribution and buying selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization interest expense net income before income taxes and minority interest

cost of goods sold  including occupancy  distribution and buying costs  increased to million  or of net sales  for fiscal  versus million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase in cost of goods sold  including occupancy  distribution and buying costs was due to the increase in net sales 
the decline in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of improved merchandise gross margins  particularly in the bridal and diamond solitaire category 
we do not expect the decrease in cost of goods sold  including occupancy  distribution and buying costs as a percentage of net sales  to constitute a continuing material trend 
selling  general and administrative expense includes i payroll costs including payroll taxes and employee benefit costs  excluding payroll costs associated with our buying and distribution personnel  ii advertising costs  iii operating costs such as insurance  utility  business related travel  professional service fees and other related business expenses  and vii provisions for bad debt and collection expense reduced by earned finance charges  earned credit insurance and late fee revenues

excluding these non comparable charges  depreciation and amortization charges for fiscal was million  or of net sales 
the slight decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of the increase in comparable store sales and our adoption of fas effective september   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
in accordance with fas  we discontinued amortization of our trade name rights beginning september   resulting in an increase in net earnings of approximately  
per fully diluted share for fiscal interest and other income from a related party  crescent  increased to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the increase was due to an increase in guarantee fee income due to higher outstanding debt owed by crescent under its bank line of credit 
interest expense decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in our effective interest rate and lower average borrowing levels 
the decrease in average borrowing levels is primarily due to net cash proceeds of million from the sale of our common stock

costs of goods sold  including occupancy  distribution and buying costs  increased to million for fiscal versus million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of a shift in our sales mix away from lower gross margin clearance merchandise as a percentage of total sales in fiscal versus fiscal selling  general and administrative expense includes i payroll costs including payroll taxes and employee benefit costs  excluding payroll costs associated with our buying and distribution personnel  ii advertising costs  iii operating costs such as insurance  utility  business related travel  professional service fees and other related business expenses  and vii provisions for bad debt and collection expense reduced by earned finance charges  earned credit insurance and late fee revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal included a million charge for the closing of stores 
the store closing charge principally consisted of the accrual of lease obligations and additional provision for anticipated write offs of uncollectible accounts

excluding this charge  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal was primarily due to higher net charge offs of customer credit accounts as compared to the prior year

income tax expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our effective income tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal net income decreased by to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  primarily as a result of increases in cost of goods sold  selling  general and administrative expenses which included a million charge for store closings and depreciation and amortization expense which included a million charge for impaired assets and interest expense 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in net sales 
basic and diluted earnings per share decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding increased to  and to  respectively  in fiscal  compared to  for both basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding in fiscal liquidity and capital resources general liquidity discussion 
during fiscal  net cash provided by our operating activities was million compared to million during fiscal and net cash used by operating activities of million during fiscal for fiscal  cash provided by operations was the result of increases in net income  offset by growth in accounts receivable and other assets and a reduction in accounts payable 
for fiscal  cash provided by operations was the result of earnings  offset by growth in accounts receivable and net inventory levels including accounts payable 
for fiscal  cash used in operations was the result of growth in accounts receivable and net inventory levels including accounts payable  which was offset partially by improved earnings 
to the extent that we continue to expand  we will continue to experience increases in credit sales and related increases in customer accounts receivables as well as increases in inventories  which will likely result in a net use of cash from operations 
investing activities used cash of million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  we made a direct investment in crescent  consisting of million of series a preferred stock and a million senior subordinated note 
also in fiscal  we opened new stores at a cost of approximately million and invested million in store re modeling and store relocations 
in fiscal  we opened new stores at a cost of approximately million and invested million in store re modeling and store relocations 
in fiscal  we opened new stores at a cost of approximately million and invested million in store re modeling and store relocations 
additionally in fiscal  we invested million in store displays to support our merchandising programs and initiatives and million on the implementation of our e commerce website 
financing activities provided cash of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal during fiscal  we refinanced our line of credit and had additional net bank borrowings of million 
also during fiscal  we issued million shares of class a common stock at a price of per share resulting in cash proceeds  net of related expenses  of million 
the proceeds of the stock offering and additional bank borrowings were used for the new investment in crescent  new stores and other capital expenditures 
additional net bank borrowings of million in fiscal and million in fiscal and were used to finance new stores and other capital expenditures  including the launch of our e commerce website in fiscal our credit facility 
on august   we entered into a new three year million secured revolving credit facility  which replaced our three year million senior secured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire on september  the facility provides for borrowings on of eligible receivables and the lesser of of eligible inventories or million 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at either the prime rate plus applicable margin ranging from zero to or  at our option  the eurodollar rate plus applicable margin ranging from to 
the applicable margin is determined based on a calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio 
the facility contains certain financial covenants and is secured by a lien on substantially all of our personal property 
at september   million was outstanding under the facility  with interest accruing on such borrowings in a range from to 
our credit facility contains the following financial covenants measured as of the end of each fiscal period  our trailing twelve month consolidated leverage ratio must not be greater than to  measured as of the end of each fiscal period  our consolidated adjusted tangible net worth must not be less than the sum of million through august   and for each fiscal period thereafter  consolidated adjusted tangible net worth must not be less than the sum of million plus as of the end of each fiscal year  commencing with the fiscal year ending september   an amount equal to of consolidated net income for that fiscal year  which increases will be cumulative  plus an amount equal to of net proceeds from certain equity transactions  measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter  our consolidated fixed charge ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarters must not be less than to  and measured as of the fiscal period ending december of each year  our retail sales must not be less than million for fiscal period ending december  and for each year thereafter  not to be less than of the projected retail sales delivered to the agent and the lenders 
for further information about the financial and other covenants under our credit facility  we refer you to the text of the agreement  which was filed as an exhibit to our current report on form k filed with the sec on september   and incorporated in this annual report by reference 
our future capital requirements 
our current plans are to have between and stores in operation for the christmas season 
we estimate that the investment required to fund this expansion  principally to finance inventory  net of accounts payable  accounts receivable  fixtures and leasehold improvements  is million 
we also anticipate investing approximately million during fiscal in store remodels and store relocations 
additionally  we anticipate spending approximately million in fiscal for various system improvements and to support merchandising and marketing initiatives 
we intend to fund these expenditures with cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility 
our credit facility matures on august  we believe that we will be able to replace this facility and that we will have sufficient capital to fund our operations through calendar in addition  in fiscal  we expect to complete the construction of our new headquarters and distribution facility in savannah  georgia at a cost of approximately million 
the construction is being funded by cash from operations and our revolving credit facility 
we anticipate financing the new facility through a mortgage loan after its completion 
our future contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at september   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands year ending september  maturity maturity maturity maturity less yr yrs yrs over yrs debt principal and other  operating leases     total commitments     financial support of crescent 
in connection with the refinancing of our credit facility in august  we restructured our financial support of crescent by terminating our guarantee of crescent s previous million senior secured revolving credit facility and making a direct investment in crescent of million 
this investment consists of million of series a preferred stock and million of a senior subordinated note 
based in part on our financial support of million  on august   crescent replaced its previous million senior secured revolving credit facility with a million secured credit facility 
we continue to hold a warrant to purchase of the capital stock of crescent for an exercise price of  that we received in consideration of our guarantee of crescent s previous credit facility on september  that warrant will expire on september  the crescent series a preferred stock carries a floating rate dividend equal to the all in cost of funds under our credit facility  plus a pre tax amount approximating a proportionate share of the guarantee fee payable by crescent under our guarantee of their previous credit facility  less the tax benefit friedman s receives from the dividends received deduction 
this calculation currently yields an approximate initial dividend rate of 
cumulative dividends on the series a preferred stock are payable semi annually on january th and july th 
we can request that the preferred stock be redeemed by crescent at any time after august  the preferred stock carries no voting rights  but does have a preference in liquidation or upon a change of control 
the senior subordinated note carries a floating interest rate equal to the all in cost of funds under our credit facility  plus an amount approximating a proportionate share of the guarantee fee payable by crescent under our guarantee of their previous credit facility 
this calculation currently yields an initial interest rate of approximately 
interest on the note is payable semi annually on january th and july th 
the note is due august  all amounts due under the note are subordinate to crescent s credit facility 
the investments were recorded on our balance sheet as a noncurrent asset and are currently carried at their face value 
in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities fas we will be required to evaluate whether there has been an other than temporary decline in the value of the investment on a quarterly basis 
any other than temporary reduction in value will result in an immediate income statement charge  which will reduce our reported net income and our earnings per share 
dividends 
on november   the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 
per share payable on january   to holders of record of our class a and class b common stock as of december  seasonality we have in the past experienced a well defined seasonality in our business with respect to both net sales and profitability 
generally  we experience substantially increased sales volume in the days preceding major holidays  including christmas  valentine s day and mother s day 
due to the impact of the christmas shopping season  we experience the strongest results of operations in the first quarter of our fiscal year 
if for any reason our sales were below those normally expected for the first quarter  our annual results could be materially adversely affected 
the seasonality of our business puts a significant demand on working capital resources to provide for an inventory buildup for the christmas season 
furthermore  the christmas season typically leads to a seasonal buildup of customer receivables that are paid down during subsequent months 
however  to the extent that our expansion program continues  it can be expected that increased levels of accounts receivable related to such expansion may affect the historical seasonal decline in customer receivables 
inflation the impact of inflation on our operating results has been moderate in recent years  reflecting generally lower rates of inflation in the economy and relative stability in the prices of diamonds  gemstones and gold 
substantially all of the leases for our retail stores located in malls provide for contingent or volume related rental increases 
in prior years  we have been able to adjust our selling prices to substantially recover increased costs 
while inflation has not had  and we do not expect that it will have  a material impact upon our operating results  there is no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  fas 
this statement applies to all exit or disposal activities initiated after december  and requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  store closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
we will adopt this accounting standard for all exit or disposal activities initiated after december  in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  fas 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supercedes fas fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt fas as of september  and do not anticipate that the pronouncement will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas on september  under fas  intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to impairment tests in accordance with the new standard 
other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
application of the non amortization provisions of fas to our trade name rights  which had previously been amortized over fifteen years  resulted in an increase in net earnings of approximately  per fully diluted share for the year ended september  during fiscal  we performed the required impairment test of trade name rights and concluded that no impairment of the asset existed 
risk factors we may not be able to manage our growth effectively  which may affect adversely the results of our operations 
the number of stores we operate has increased greatly during the past four years 
for example  we opened approximately net new stores during fiscal  net new stores during fiscal  net new stores during fiscal  and net new stores during fiscal we intend to continue to expand  adding approximately to net new stores in fiscal our growth has placed and will continue to place  significant demands on all aspects of our business  including our management information and distribution systems and personnel 
in addition  this growth has required substantial investments necessary to build our brand name  store base and infrastructure in the new markets we have entered and has resulted in a decline in our operating margins 
also in  our chief financial officer relocated his principal office to oakland  california  in the executive offices of crescent  joining our chief executive officer whose principal offices are also located in oakland 
both officers spend a significant amount of their time on site in our principal executive offices in savannah  georgia  however  this dual location of offices may negatively affect the efficiency of our operations 
for these reasons  we may not be successful in continuing or successfully managing our growth  which could result in a reduction in our historical revenue growth  or an increase in cost of goods sold which would directly and adversely affect our earnings 
we may not be able to successfully execute our growth strategy 
our growth strategy depends upon our ability to successfully open and operate new stores 
our success in opening and operating new stores depends upon a number of factors  including  among others  our ability to maintain the cash flow required to open and stock new stores  identify store locations that match our power strip or regional mall profiles  negotiate acceptable lease terms  open new stores in a timely manner  source sufficient levels of inventory to meet the needs of new stores  hire and train qualified store personnel  and successfully integrate new stores into our existing operations 
we anticipate opening approximately to net new stores in fiscal in addition  any expansion into new markets may present different competitive  advertising  merchandising and distribution challenges than those we encounter in our existing markets 
expansion in our existing markets may cause the net sales volumes in our existing stores in those markets to decline 
if we are unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategy  our business  operating results and financial position could be adversely affected 
our industry is highly competitive  and if we fall behind our competitors  our earnings and stock price may be adversely affected 
the retail jewelry business is mature and highly competitive 
our retail jewelry business competes with national and regional jewelry chains  as well as with local independently owned jewelry stores and chains 
we also compete with other types of retailers who sell jewelry and gift items  such as department stores  catalog showrooms  discount retailers  direct mail suppliers  television home shopping networks and jewelry retailers who make sales through internet sites 
our credit operations compete with credit card companies and other providers of consumer credit 
we believe that we compete on the basis of selection of merchandise offered  pricing  quality of sales associates  advertising  ability to offer in house credit  store location and reputation 
many competitors are substantially larger than we are and have greater financial resources than we have 
we may not be able to compete successfully with such competitors 
competition could cause us to lose customers  increase expenditures or reduce pricing  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
the actions of the united states against terrorists and the countries in which they live or operate and the potential for hostile actions by the united states against iraq may result in a decrease in consumer spending and significantly harm our business 
on september   the united states suffered substantial terrorist attacks and  as a result  initiated retaliatory action against the terrorists and the countries  which harbor  finance and otherwise support them 
in addition  the us government is contemplating hostile action against the current regime in iraq 
consumers may be less likely to purchase luxury items  such as our jewelry products  during times of such political  economic and social uncertainty  which would harm our sales revenue 
further  armed conflicts and political instability overseas may impair our ability to obtain gold  diamonds and other precious and semi precious metals and stones from foreign countries  potentially increasing our cost of goods sold 
our results of operations have been and may continue to be significantly affected by a downturn in general economic conditions 
jewelry is a luxury item  not a necessity product 
as a result  recent adverse trends in the general economy  such as decreases in employment levels  decreases in the stock market  and decreases in wages and salaries  have affected sales of our jewelry 
historically  people spend less money on luxury items  such as jewelry  during a decline in general economic activity 
also  negative developments in local economic conditions  such as plant closings  industry slowdowns and employment cutbacks  may affect sales of our jewelry 
we depend on customer traffic at the power strip centers and malls where our stores are located 
reductions in consumer spending due to general economic conditions have affected and may continue to negatively affect our net sales 
a majority of our customers use credit either from us or another consumer credit source to purchase jewelry from us 
when there are adverse trends in the general economy or increases in interest rates  fewer people use credit 
general economic trends also affect our credit operations 
the downturn in the general economy and the economic conditions in the markets in which we operate has affected our ability to collect outstanding credit accounts receivable  and could continue to do so if such conditions persist 
if this continues  it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
instances of litigation relating to the sale of credit insurance have increased in the retail industry and our business could be adversely affected by this litigation 
states attorneys generals and private plaintiffs have filed lawsuits against retailers relating to alleged improper practices conducted in connection with the sale of credit insurance in several jurisdictions around the country 
we offer credit insurance in many of our stores and encourage the purchase of credit insurance products in connection with sales of merchandise on credit 
we have been sued in two states by private plaintiffs with regard to our sale of credit insurance 
we are also in discussions with attorney generals from several states about our credit insurance sales practices 
the results of those discussions may be the settlement of any alleged infractions  or those states may decide to file a lawsuit against us 
either a settlement or lawsuit where we were found liable could require us to pay substantial damages or incur substantial costs  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and stock price 
also  an adverse judgment or any negative publicity associated with credit insurance settlements or litigation pending against us could affect our reputation and this could have a negative impact on sales of our jewelry and credit insurance products 
our business is highly seasonal  which may cause significant fluctuations in our results 
our first fiscal quarter  which ends in december  has historically been the strongest quarter of the year in terms of net sales and operating income 
any substantial disruption of holiday season shopping or other events  which affect our first quarter results  could have a material adverse effect on our profitability for the whole year 
our quarterly results of operations also may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  net sales contributed by new stores  actions of competitors  timing of certain holidays  changes in our merchandise  and general economic  industry and weather conditions that affect consumer spending 
additionally  if for any reason our sales fall below those normally expected for our first quarter  our stock price may fall during our second quarter after we announce our first quarter results of operations 
the loss of our chief executive officer or other key personnel could significantly harm our business 
our management and operations depend on the skills and experience of our senior management team  including our chief executive officer  bradley j 
stinn 
we believe that our ability to successfully implement our growth strategies depends on the continued employment of our senior management team 
the loss of mr 
stinn or a significant number of other senior officers could hurt us materially 
we do not currently have employment agreements with  or key man life insurance for  any senior officer  including mr 
stinn 
fluctuations in the availability  prices and quality of our merchandise may affect our results of operations 
we primarily sell jewelry made of gold and diamonds and  to a lesser extent  other precious and semi precious metals and stones 
the prices of these materials have been  and we expect for them to continue to be  subject to significant volatility 
further  both the supply and price of diamonds are significantly influenced by a single entity  diamond trading corporation 
we do not maintain long term inventories or otherwise hedge against fluctuations in the cost of gold or diamonds 
a significant increase in the price of gold and diamonds could adversely affect our sales and gross margins 
our supply of diamonds comes primarily from south africa  botswana  zaire  russia and australia 
changes in the social  political or economic conditions in one or more of these countries could have an adverse effect on our supply of diamonds 
any sustained interruption in the supply of diamonds from these producing countries could result in price increases for available diamonds and adversely affect our product costs and  as a result  our earnings 
our merchandising strategy also depends upon our ability to find and maintain good relations with a few choice vendors 
we compete with other jewelry retailers for access to vendors that will provide us with the quality and quantity of merchandise necessary to operate our business 
in fiscal  our top five suppliers accounted for approximately of our total purchases 
although we believe that alternative sources of supply are available  the abrupt loss of any of our vendors or a decline in the quality or quantity of merchandise supplied by our vendors could cause significant disruption in our business as we substitute vendors 
a substantial portion of the merchandise we sell is carried on a consignment basis prior to sale or is otherwise financed by vendors  thereby reducing our direct capital investment in inventory 
the percentage of our total inventory that was carried on consignment for fiscal  and based on the inventory levels at the end of each period was  and  respectively 
the willingness of vendors to enter into such arrangements may vary substantially from time to time based on a number of factors  including the merchandise involved  the financial resources of vendors  interest rates  availability of financing  fluctuations in gem and gold prices  inflation  our financial condition and a number of economic or competitive conditions in the jewelry business or the economy 
any change in these relationships would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
see business purchasing and inventory control 
we may make acquisitions or investments that are not successful and that adversely affect our ongoing operations 
as part of our growth strategy  we may acquire or make investments in other retail jewelry businesses  including a potential consolidation with crescent  our affiliate 
since we have grown primarily by opening new retail jewelry stores  our ability to identify acquisition candidates  conduct acquisitions and properly manage the integration of acquisitions is unproven 
if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments and assimilate acquired operations into our own  it may materially harm our business and operating results 
in addition  acquisitions and investments could divert our management s attention from our core operations  which may adversely affect our operating results 
our investment of million in crescent is unsecured  and is therefore subject to the same risks as any equity or unsecured investment  any reduction in the value of that investment would result in an immediate charge to our earnings  adversely affecting our reported results of operations and likely our stock price 
in connection with the refinancing of our credit facility in august  we restructured our financial support of crescent by terminating our guarantee of crescent s previous million senior secured revolving credit facility and making a direct investment in crescent of million 
this investment consists of million of series a preferred stock and million of a senior subordinated note 
both investments are unsecured

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities fas  we will be required to evaluate whether there has been an other than temporary decline in the value of the investment on a quarterly basis 
any other than temporary reduction in value will result in an immediate income statement charge  which will reduce our reported net income and earnings per share 
the reduction in the value of our investment in crescent  which would likely result from a deterioration in its financial condition and results of operations  and the resulting charge to our earnings would most likely have a negative impact on the trading price of our class a common stock on the nasdaq stock market

our credit and insurance business may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations governing our business 
the operation of our credit and insurance business subjects us to substantial regulation relating to disclosure and other requirements upon origination  servicing  debt collection and particularly upon the amount of finance changes we can impose 
any adverse change in the regulation of consumer credit could adversely affect our net sales and cost of goods sold 
for example  new laws or regulations could limit the amount of interest or fees we could charge on consumer loan accounts  or restrict our ability to collect on account balances  which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
federal and states laws and regulations also impact the various types of insurance that we offer 
we operate in many jurisdictions and are subject to the complex rules and regulations of each jurisdiction 
these rules and regulations may undergo periodic modifications and are subject to differing statutory interpretations  which could make compliance more difficult and more costly 
compliance with existing and future laws or regulations could require material expenditures or otherwise adversely affect our business or financial results 
failure to comply with these laws or regulations  even if inadvertent  could result in negative publicity  fines  additional licensing expenses or the revocation of our licenses to sell insurance in these jurisdictions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and stock price 
see also business government regulation 
the future of our credit business is uncertain  which may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 
approximately of our net sales are on credit 
our credit programs allow our customers to purchase more expensive and larger quantities of our merchandise  which enables our stores to have higher average sales 
a decrease in credit sales could have a material adverse effect on our earnings by lowering our net sales 
also  credit sales lead to more frequent contact and better personal relationships with the approximately of our credit customers who choose to make in store installment payments 
as a result  a decrease in credit sales could also reduce traffic in our stores and lower our revenues 
we adhere to strict credit application guidelines in determining whether our customers qualify for credit 
during a downturn in general economic conditions  as we are currently experiencing  or local economic development such as plant closings  fewer of our customers may qualify for credit  and we may suffer a higher rate of non payment  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or result of operations 
as we expand our store base into new markets  we obtain new credit accounts  which present a higher risk than our mature credit accounts  as these new customers do not have an established credit history with us 
since it takes time to evaluate the credit characteristics of our new customers  we may experience initial uncertainty in our credit portfolio 
also  since we conduct our collection procedures at the store level  our collection efforts are decentralized and become more decentralized as our store base grows 
difficulties we may encounter in maintaining the currency of our credit accounts could result in a material adverse effect on our earnings 
we use a computer credit scoring process to determine whether a credit applicant should be approved for a credit account and  if so  the credit limit that should be applied to the account 
the computer credit scoring process relies on a computer model  which we revise from time to time 
if our computer credit scoring process fails to accurately analyze the credit risk of applicant due to a computer failure or errors in the model  our credit losses may be greater than anticipated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk is limited to fluctuations in interest rates as it pertains to our borrowings under our credit facility 
we pay interest on borrowings at either the prime rate plus an applicable margin ranging from to or  at our option  the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin ranging from to 
if the interest rates on our borrowings average basis points more in fiscal than they did in fiscal  our interest expense would increase and income before income taxes would decrease by  this amount is determined solely by considering the impact of the hypothetical change in the interest rate on our borrowing cost without consideration for other factors such as actions management might take to mitigate its exposure to interest rate changes
