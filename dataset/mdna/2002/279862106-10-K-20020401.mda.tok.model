item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview were outstanding for all periods prior to the combination  effective march  ebitda represents income loss before cumulative effect of accounting change  interest expense  income taxes  depletion  depreciation and amortization and impairment 
our management believes that ebitda may provide additional information about our ability to meet our future requirements for debt service  capital expenditures and working capital 
ebitda is a financial measure commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or as a measure of a company s profitability or liquidity 
because ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income  this measure may vary among companies 
the ebitda data presented above may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of other companies 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a review of our financial position and results of operations for the periods indicated 
our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data and the related notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general overview we were organized as a delaware corporation in august in connection with our initial public offering the offering and the related combination of certain entities that held interests in the edge joint venture ii the joint venture and certain other oil and natural gas properties  herein referred to as the combination 
in a series of combination transactions  we issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock and received in exchange for of the ownership interests in the joint venture and certain other oil and natural gas properties 
in march  and contemporaneously with the combination  we completed the offering of  shares of our common stock generating proceeds of approximately million  net of expenses 
we have evolved over that time from a prospect generation organization focused solely on high risk  high reward exploration to a team driven organization focused on a balanced program of exploration  exploitation  development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties 
following a top level management change in late  a disciplined style of business planning and management was integrated into our technology driven drilling activities 
after giving effect to the time needed to make those changes  there have been significant activities that have resulted in growth in reserves  production and financial strength 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including certain general and administrative costs that are directly attributable to our acquisition  exploration and development activities  are capitalized in a full cost pool as incurred 
we record depletion of our full cost pool using the unit of production method 
investments in unproved properties are not subject to amortization until the proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impaired 
to the extent that capitalized costs subject to amortization in the full cost pool net of depletion  depreciation and amortization and related deferred taxes exceed the present value using a discount rate of estimated future net after tax cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves  such excess costs are charged to operations 
once incurred  an impairment of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date 
impairment of oil and natural gas properties is assessed on a quarterly basis 
for each of the years ended december   and  respectively  no full cost ceiling test write down was necessary 
due to the instability of oil and natural gas prices  we have entered into  from time to time  price risk management transactions eg  swaps  collars and floors for a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce exposure from price fluctuations 
while the use of these arrangements may limit the benefit to us of increases in the price of oil and natural gas  it also limits the downside risk of adverse price movements 
our hedging arrangements typically apply to only a portion of our production  providing only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices 
we account for these transactions as hedging activities and  accordingly  gains and losses are included in oil and natural gas revenue during the period the hedged production occurs 
at december   we were not a party to any hedging transactions 
at december  a natural gas collar was in place 
the natural gas collar covered  mmbtus per day for the period january  to december  at a per mmbtu floor and a per mmbtu ceiling 
on january   we closed out the hedge for the period february  to december  at a cost of  at december  and  the fair value  gain loss  of outstanding hedges was approximately million and  respectively 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our revenue  profitability and future rate of growth and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  and the carrying value of our properties  are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas 
these prices are dependent upon numerous factors beyond our control  such as economic  political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy 
a substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and access to capital  as well as the quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that we may economically produce 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue and production oil and natural gas revenue increased from million in to million in for  natural gas production comprised of total production and contributed of total revenue  oil and condensate comprised of total production and contributed of total revenue  and ngl s comprised of total production and contributed of total revenue 
for  natural gas production comprised of total production and of total revenue while oil and condensate production accounted for of total production and of revenue and ngls production comprised of total production and of oil and gas revenue 
the following table summarizes production volumes  average sales prices and operating revenue for our oil and natural gas operations for the years ended december  and period compared to period december  increase increase decrease decrease production volumes natural gas mcf    oil and condensate bbls    natural gas liquids bbls    natural gas equivalent mcfe    average sales price natural gas per mcf oil and condensate per bbl natural gas liquids per bbl natural gas equivalent per mcfe operating revenue natural gas    oil and condensate    natural gas liquids    total    includes the effect of hedging 
natural gas revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for increased production and the favorable impact of higher natural gas prices were partially offset by the impact of a hedging loss 
for the year ended december   natural gas production increased from mcf d in to mcf d in resulting in an increase in revenue of approximately million based on comparable period prices 
the average natural gas sales price for production in was per mcf  exclusive of hedging activity  compared to per mcf for  exclusive of hedging activity 
this increase in average price realized resulted in increased revenue of approximately million based on current year production 
included within natural gas revenue for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively  representing losses from hedging activity 
these losses decreased the effective natural gas sales price by per mcf and per mcf  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue from the sale of oil and condensate totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of from the prior year total of million 
the year ended december  included net losses from oil hedge activity of  no oil hedges were in place for production volumes for oil and condensate increased to bbls d for the year ended december  compared to bbls d for the same prior year period 
the increase in oil and condensate production caused an increase in revenue of approximately  based on comparable period average prices 
the average realized price for oil and condensate for the year ended december  was per barrel compared to per barrel  excluding the impact of net oil hedge losses of per barrel  in lower average prices for the year resulted in a decrease in revenue of  based on current year production 
revenue from the sale of ngls totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of from the total of million 
production volumes for ngls for the year ended december  decreased  from bbls d to bbls d  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in ngl production decreased revenue by  based on comparable period average prices 
this decrease in production was largely due to high natural gas prices decreasing the economic value of ngl s and a resulting decision by management not to process our gas during several months of favorable pricing for the year ended december  resulted in an increase in revenue of  based on current year production 
the average realized price for ngls for the year ended december  was per barrel compared to per barrel for the same period in production of oil and natural gas was significantly impacted by our drilling results in the second half of and in we successfully drilled and completed gross net wells in the year ended december  that added additional production and revenue for gas production increases were due primarily to the drilling of  and strong performance from  the o connor ranch wells  the ibarra and la jolla parr wells on our la jolla prospect  the mire well on our horeb prospect and the robertson well on our duson frio prospect 
partially offsetting the favorable results of drilling were production declines on our older wells  primarily the margo and wells 
costs and operating expenses operating expenses for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million in the same period of  an increase of 
current year results were impacted by the increased number of wells operating in compared to the prior year as well as higher treating costs at the austin facility for a portion of  higher salt water disposal costs on our older wells  and higher well control insurance costs incurred in compared to the prior year 
operating expenses averaged per mcfe for the year ended december  compared to per mcfe for the prior year period 
the increase in operating expenses on a mcfe basis was due to the factors resulting in an overall increase in operating expenses described previously 
severance and ad valorem taxes for the year ended december  increased from million in  to million in  due to higher severance taxes paid on the increased revenue  primarily in the first quarter of on an equivalent basis  severance and ad valorem taxes were per mcfe and per mcfe for the years ended december  and  respectively 
depletion  depreciation and amortization expense dd a for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  full cost dd a on our oil and natural gas properties totaled million for compared to million in depletion expense on a unit of production basis for the year ended december  was per mcfe  higher than the rate of per mcfe 
the higher depletion rate per mcfe resulted in an increase in depletion expense of million 
for the year ended december   higher oil and natural gas production compared to the prior year period resulted in an increase in depletion expense of million 
the increase in the depletion rate was primarily due to a higher amortizable base in compared to the prior year 
in december  we recorded costs of million related to the settlement of our litigation with bnp 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
general and administrative expenses g a for the year ended december   excluding the deferred compensation expense discussed below  totaled million  a increase from the total of million 
the increase in costs was due primarily to bad debt expense of  reserved in  of which related to purchases by an enron affiliate  costs of  to purchase options from a former employee  higher salaries and related benefits  and higher legal and audit fees 
for the years ended december  and  g a costs were reduced by overhead reimbursement fees of approximately  and  respectively 
g a on a unit of production basis for the year ended december  was per mcfe per mcfe excluding the bad debt expense and the purchase of options compared to per mcfe for the comparable period 
deferred compensation cost reported in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation was a credit of  for the year ended december  compared to a charge of  in the comparable prior year period 
fin requires  among other things  a non cash charge to compensation expense if the price of our common stock on the last trading day of a reporting period is greater than the exercise price of certain options 
fin could also result in a credit to compensation expense to the extent that the trading price declines from the trading price as of the end of the prior period  but not below the exercise price of the options 
we adjust deferred compensation expense upward or downward on a monthly basis based on the trading price at the end of each such period as necessary to comply with fin we are required to report under this rule as a result of non qualified stock options granted to employees and directors in prior years and re priced in may of  as well as certain options newly issued in conjunction with the repricing 
also included in deferred compensation is amortization related to restricted stock awards granted during and for the years ended december  and  such amortization totaled  and  respectively 
no unearned compensation was reported in unearned compensation expense for the year ended december  totaled  and relates to restricted stock granted to executives at the completion of the offering 
included in other income expense was interest expense of  for the year ended december  compared to  in the same period 
interest expense  including facility fees  was  for the year on weighted average debt of million compared to interest expense of  on weighted average debt of approximately million for the same prior year period 
also included in interest expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively  representing amortization of deferred loan costs associated with a new credit facility 
capitalized interest for the year ended december  totaled  compared to  in the prior year 
the reduction in capitalized interest resulted from lower interest costs incurred during the year ended december  compared to the same prior year period 
although gross interest expense has decreased compared to the prior year  the effect of less interest being capitalized to oil and natural gas properties has resulted in higher net interest costs reported in our results of operations 
interest income totaled  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in the increase in interest income is due to the overall increase in funds invested in overnight money market funds 
other income expense for the year ended december  also included a loss on the sale of our investment in frontera of  or per share 
an income tax benefit was recorded for the year ended december  of  as of december   approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards have been accumulated that begin to expire in based on our year end projections  we now believe that we will fully realize our recorded tax assets 
accordingly   in associated valuation reserves was reversed in future financial statement income will necessitate income tax provisions at our effective rate 
currently  we do not anticipate a federal tax liability or making federal tax payments in for the year ended december  no tax expense or benefit was recorded because an allowance was provided to offset the tax benefits of certain tax assets 
for the year ended december   the company had net income of million  or basic earnings per share  as compared to net income of million  or basic earnings per share  in weighted average shares outstanding increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to million in the comparable period 
the increase was due primarily to options exercised and vesting of restricted stock during year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue and production oil and natural gas revenue increased from million in to million in for  natural gas production comprised of total production and contributed of total revenue  oil and condensate comprised of total production and contributed of total revenue  and ngl s comprised of total production and contributed of total revenue 
for  natural gas production comprised of total production and of total revenue while oil and condensate production accounted for of total production and of revenue and ngls production comprised of total production and of oil and gas revenue

natural gas revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the favorable impact of higher natural gas prices was partially offset by the impact of hedging losses and decreased production 
the average natural gas sales price for production in was per mcf  exclusive of hedging activity  compared to per mcf for  exclusive of hedging activity 
this increase in average price realized resulted in increased revenue of approximately million based on current year production 
included within natural gas revenue for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively  representing losses from hedging activity 
these losses decreased the effective natural gas sales price by per mcf and per mcf  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   natural gas production decreased from mcf d in to mcf d in resulting in a decrease in revenue of approximately million based on comparable period prices 
revenue from the sale of oil and condensate totaled million for the year ended december  including net losses from oil hedge activity of  an increase of from the prior year total of million 
favorable pricing for the year resulted in an increase in revenue of million based on current year production 
the average realized price for oil and condensate for the year ended december  was per barrel  excluding the impact of net oil hedge losses of per barrel  compared to per barrel for the same period in production volumes for oil and condensate decreased to bbls d for the year ended december  compared to bbls d for the same prior year period 
the decrease in oil and condensate production caused a decrease in revenue of approximately  based on comparable period average prices 
revenue from the sale of ngls totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of from the total of  favorable pricing for the year ended december  resulted in an increase in revenue of  based on current year production 
the average realized price for ngls for the year ended december  was per barrel compared to per barrel for the same period in production volumes for ngls for the year ended december  increased  from bbls d to bbls d  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in ngl production increased revenue by  based on comparable period average prices 
production of oil and natural gas was significantly impacted by the sale of certain oil and natural gas properties effective july  and april  offsetting these declines was the adjustment in june for months of revenue associated with payout on our mcfaddin properties that reached payout in july  but was not determined until june this adjustment resulted in recognition in of  on production of  mcfe 
in addition  we successfully drilled and completed gross net wells in the year ended december  that added additional production and revenue for the current year period 
costs and operating expenses operating expenses for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million in the same period of  an increase of 
results for were impacted by the recording in june of months of lifting costs totaling approximately  associated with our mcfaddin properties that reached payout in july but was not determined until june in addition  costs increased due to compression charges and salt water disposal costs on certain older properties 
these additional costs more than offset the effect of lower costs resulting from the disposition of proved producing properties effective july   and corporate efforts focused on improving the operating structure in the field 
operating expenses averaged per mcfe for the year ended december  compared to per mcfe for the prior year period 
the increase in operating expenses on a mcfe basis was due to the factors resulting in an overall increase in operating expenses described previously and the sale of certain properties during the third quarter of that had lower overall average operating costs 
severance and ad valorem taxes for the year ended december  increased from million in to million in due primarily to higher severance taxes paid on the increased revenue  primarily in the fourth quarter of on an equivalent basis  severance and ad valorem taxes were per mcfe and per mcfe for the years ended december  and  respectively 
depletion  depreciation and amortization expense dd a for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  full cost dd a on our oil and natural gas properties totaled million for compared to million in depletion expense on a unit of production basis for the year ended december  was per mcfe  lower than the rate of per mcfe 
for the year ended december   lower oil and natural gas production compared to the prior year period resulted in a decrease in depletion expense of  the decrease in the depletion rate was primarily due to year end reserve base additions and revisions 
general and administrative expenses g a for the year ended december   excluding the deferred compensation expense discussed below  totaled million  a decrease from the total of million 
the decrease in costs was due primarily to lower salaries and related benefits attributable to a work force reduction during january for the year ended december  and  g a was reduced by overhead reimbursement fees of approximately  and  respectively 
g a on a unit of production basis for the year ended december  was per mcfe compared to per mcfe for the comparable period 
a non cash charge to compensation expense of  or per share  was required in in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
fin requires  among other things  a non cash charge to compensation expense if the price of edge s common stock on the last trading day of a reporting period is greater than the exercise price of certain options 
fin could also result in a credit to compensation expense to the extent that the trading price declines from the trading price as of the end of the prior period  but not below the exercise price of the options 
we adjust deferred compensation expense upward or downward on a monthly basis based on the trading price at the end of each such period as necessary to comply with fin the charge was related to non qualified stock options granted to employees and directors in prior years and re priced in may of  as well as certain options newly issued in conjunction with the repricing 
also included in deferred compensation for the year ended december  is amortization of  related to restricted stock awards granted during unearned compensation expense for the year ended december  totaled  compared to  in the prior year period 
the amortization of unearned compensation expense is recognized from restricted stock granted to executives at the completion of the offering 
the decrease was due to the resignation of the former president and chief operating officer in december at which time he vested in his remaining restricted stock grant 
we charged to expense the unamortized unearned compensation associated with his restricted stock upon his resignation 
the other charge during of approximately million primarily represented expenses incurred as a result of the resignation of our former president and chief operating officer in as a result of his resignation we recorded a one time charge of approximately million to satisfy corporate obligations under his employment contract 
included in the million was a million non cash amount relating to the vesting of the remaining balance of the executive s restricted common stock award granted concurrent with our offering see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the balance of the charge primarily represented an accrual for workforce reduction and cash payments to be paid to the former executive from the date of his resignation to december  other income expense for the year ended december  consisted primarily of a loss on the sale of our investment in frontera of 
also included in other income expense was interest expense of  for the year ended december  compared to  in the same period 
interest expense was  for the year on weighted average debt of million compared to interest expense of  on weighted average debt of approximately million for the same prior year period 
also included in interest expense for the year ended december  was  representing amortization of deferred loan costs associated with a new credit facility 
capitalized interest for the year ended december  totaled  a decrease of over the prior year amount of  for the same period 
the reduction in capitalized interest resulted from lower exploration activities during the year ended december  compared to the same prior year period 
although interest expense has decreased compared to the prior year  the effect of less interest being capitalized to oil and natural gas properties has resulted in higher net interest costs reported in our results of operations 
interest income totaled  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in the increase in interest income is due to the overall increase in funds invested in overnight money market funds 
due to our significant deferred tax assets  no tax expense was recorded for the year ended december  or because of the uncertainty at december  and as to whether we would have future profitability  an allowance was provided to offset the tax benefits of certain tax assets 
for the year ended december  we had net income of million  or basic earnings per share  as compared to a net loss of million  in weighted average shares outstanding increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to million in the comparable period 
the increase was due primarily to the private placement of million shares of common stock in may liquidity and capital resources in march  we completed the offering of  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share 
the offering provided us with proceeds of approximately million  net of expenses 
we used approximately million to repay our long term outstanding indebtedness incurred under our revolving credit facility in place at the time  subordinated loans and equipment loans 
the remaining proceeds from the offering  together with cash flows from operations  were used to fund capital expenditures  commitments  and other working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes 
on may   we completed a private offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
we also issued warrants  which were purchased for per warrant  to acquire an additional  shares of common stock at per share and are exercisable through may  at our election  the warrants may be called at a redemption price of per warrant at any time after any date at which the average daily per share closing bid price for the immediately proceeding consecutive trading days exceeds 
no warrants have been exercised as of december  total proceeds  net of offering costs  were approximately million of which million was used to repay debt under our revolving credit facility in place at the time  with the remainder being utilized to satisfy working capital requirements and to fund a portion of our exploration program 
pursuant to the terms of the private placement  we filed a registration statement with the commission registering the resale of the shares of common stock and the warrants sold in the private placement  as well as the resale of any shares of common stock issued pursuant to such warrants 
we had cash and cash equivalents at december  of  consisting primarily of short term money market investments  as compared to  at december  working capital was million as of december   as compared to million at december  excluding the current portion of long term debt  working capital was million at december cash flows provided by operations were million  million and million  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the significant increase in cash flows provided by operations for the year ended december  is primarily due to higher net income in  lower accounts receivable balances at december  compared to the prior year and higher accrued liabilities at the current year end 
high commodity prices during the fourth quarter of resulted in substantial accounts receivable balances for production revenue received in but prices were significantly lower at december  resulting in lower accounts receivable balances 
operating cash flows  before changes in working capital  for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in operating cash flows from to was due primarily to higher oil and natural gas revenue partially offset by increased operating costs  including the million litigation settlement in december the increase from to was due primarily to higher oil and natural gas revenue during as a result of higher production and average commodity prices 
we reinvest a substantial portion of our cash flows in our drilling  acquisition  land and geophysical activities 
as a result  we used million in investing activities during  all of which were capital expenditures 
capital expenditures of million were attributable to the drilling of gross wells  of which were successful 
acquisition costs totaled million for the year ended december   and an additional million in expenditures was attributable to land holdings  including million for increased seismic data and other geological and geophysical expenditures 
the remaining capital expenditures were associated with computer hardware and office equipment 
during the year ended december   we used million in investing activities  including capital expenditures of million 
capital expenditures of million were attributed to drilling gross wells  of which were successful 
capital expenditures of million were attributable to land holdings and million was attributable to increased seismic data and other geological and geophysical expenditures 
these expenditures were offset by proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties of million and net proceeds from the sale of our investment in frontera of million 
during the year ended december   we used million of cash in investing activities including capital expenditures of approximately million 
capital expenditures of million were attributed to the drilling of gross wells  of which were successful 
capital expenditures of million were attributable to increased land holdings and million was attributable to increased seismic data and other geologic and geophysical expenditures 
capital expenditures of approximately  were used for the acquisition of computer hardware and office equipment 
capital expenditures were offset by proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas prospects of million 
during august  we completed a transaction in which we sold  effective july   our working interests in proved producing and undeveloped properties within our bta and spartan extension d project areas in goliad and victoria counties  texas 
proceeds from the sale were approximately million 
pursuant to a rights offering conducted by frontera in november  we agreed to purchase  shares of frontera common stock plus such additional shares  if necessary  to maintain our then current interest of the partially diluted outstanding frontera common stock assuming conversion of all preferred stock 
as a result  we paid frontera  in december for  shares of frontera common stock   in january for  shares of frontera common stock and  in april for  shares of frontera common stock bringing our total investment in frontera to  we sold our interest in frontera in june for net proceeds of million 
we currently anticipate capital expenditures in to be approximately million 
approximately million is allocated to our expected drilling and production activities  million is allocated to land and seismic activities  and million relates to capitalized interest and g a and other 
we plan to fund these expenditures largely from cash flow from operations plus some modest incremental borrowings 
we have not explicitly budgeted for acquisitions  however  we do expect to spend considerable effort evaluating acquisition opportunities 
we expect to fund acquisitions through traditional reserve based bank debt and  if required  through additional debt and equity financings 
cash flows provided by financing activities totaled million for the year ended december  including million in borrowings and million in repayments under our current credit facility 
in addition  we received  in proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to options exercised in cash flows used in financing activities in were million  including borrowings of million and repayments of million under our revolving credit facility and the predecessor facility 
we also incurred loan costs of approximately  in establishing our new credit facility 
financing activities during were comprised of a private offering of common stock that generated net proceeds of million offset by a net repayment of debt of million 
due to our active exploration  development and acquisition activities  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience substantial working capital requirements 
we intend to fund our capital expenditures  commitments and working capital requirements through cash flows from operations  and to the extent necessary other financing activities 
the projected cash flows from operations are estimated to be sufficient to fund our budgeted exploration and development program 
we believe we will be able to generate capital resources and liquidity sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and meet such financial obligations as they come due 
in the event such capital resources are not available to us  our drilling and other activities may be curtailed 
see items and business and properties forward looking information and risk factors significant capital requirements 
credit facility in october  we entered into a new credit facility the credit facility with a bank 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to prime plus or libor plus 
as of december   million in borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility 
the credit facility matures october  and is secured by substantially all of our assets 
proceeds from the borrowings in under the credit facility were used to fund the december property acquisition and the payment to bnp for the litigation settlement 
originally the borrowing base under the credit facility was million and was subject to automatic reductions at a rate of  per month beginning october  in march  the credit facility was amended to increase the borrowing base to million  and to eliminate the  per month automatic reduction 
in january  the borrowing base was increased to million 
the borrowing base will be re determined again during the second quarter of and is expected to include adjustments for the recent success of the thibodeaux well in louisiana  other drilling successes and the acquisition in late december of properties in south texas that were not factored into the january borrowing base of million  offset in part by ordinary declines in reserves from production 
the credit facility provides for certain restrictions  including but not limited to  limitations on additional borrowings and issues of capital stock  sales of oil and natural gas properties or other collateral  engaging in merger or consolidation transactions 
the credit facility also prohibits dividends and certain distributions of cash or properties and certain liens 
the credit facility also contains certain financial covenants 
the ebitda to interest expense ratio requires that a our consolidated ebitda  as defined in the agreement  for the four fiscal quarters then ended to b our consolidated interest expense for the four fiscal quarters then ended  to not be less than to the working capital ratio requires that the amount of our consolidated current assets less our consolidated current liabilities  as defined in the agreement  be at least million 
the allowable expenses ratio requires that a the aggregate amount of our year to date consolidated general and administrative expenses for the period from january of such year through the fiscal quarter then ended to b our year to date consolidated oil and gas revenues  net of hedging activity  for the period from january of such year through the fiscal quarter then ended  to be less than to accounting pronouncements derivatives we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas effective january  the statement  as amended  requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value  and changes in the fair value of derivatives be reported in current earnings  unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedge 
if the intended use of the derivative is to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  a liability or firm commitment  then the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument will generally be offset in the income statement by the change in the item s fair value 
however  if the intended use of the derivative is to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows then the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument will generally be reported in other comprehensive income oci 
the gains and losses on the derivative instrument that are reported in oci will be reclassified to earnings in the period in which earnings are impacted by the hedged item 
when hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur  the derivative will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value and gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income will be recognized in earnings immediately 
in all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued  the derivative will be carried at fair value on the balance sheet with future changes in its fair value recognized in earnings prospectively 
we account for our natural gas and crude oil hedge derivative instruments as cash flow hedges under sfas although the fair value of our derivative instruments fluctuates daily  as of january   the fair value of our natural gas hedge derivative instruments was approximately million  which was recorded in the consolidated balance sheet on january  the million was recorded as a liability on our balance sheet as part of the transition adjustment related to our adoption of sfas the offset to this balance sheet adjustment was a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
in early january  we closed out of our hedge obligation for the period from february  to december  in accordance with sfas  the cost to close out of the hedge was recognized in net income over the period in which the hedged production occurred 
as of december   the full loss from the close out of  has been recorded to net income 
as of december   we were not a party to any hedging activity

when the liability is initially recorded  the entity increases the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
accretion of the liability is recognized each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application encouraged 
we are currently evaluating the effect of adopting statement no 
on our financial statements and have not determined the timing of adoption 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses the accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
establishes one accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale as well as resolves implementation issues related to sfas no 
the standard also expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january  the adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
we do not expect the adoption of any of the above mentioned standards to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
hedging activities in december  we entered into a natural gas collar that covered  mmbtu per day for the period january  to december  at a floor of per mmbtu and a ceiling of per mmbtu 
on january   we closed out the hedge for the period february  to december  at a cost of  as of december   we had no hedges in place 
we believe that hedges should be used as a financial tool to protect against the effects of a leveraged capital structure  ensure project rates of return from acquisitions and to help management budget and plan 
recommendations with respect to hedging opportunities are made by both the financial and marketing departments to our management committee and chief executive officer for approval 
the administration of hedges  if any  is handled jointly by the finance  marketing and production departments 
in march  we purchased a natural gas floor at per mmbtu covering  mmbtus per day for the period april  to june  at a cost of  see items and business and properties marketing 
tax matters at december   we have cumulative net operating loss carryforwards nols for federal income tax purposes of approximately million that will begin to expire in we anticipate that all of these nols will be utilized in connection with federal income taxes payable in the future 
in the fourth quarter of we reversed a valuation allowance that previously offset our deferred tax assets 
to the extent that we have financial statement income in the future  we will require a tax provision in our consolidated statement of operations 
nols assume that certain items  primarily intangible drilling costs have been written off for tax purposes in the current year 
however  we have not made a final determination if an election will be made to capitalize all or part of these items for tax purposes in the future 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
we use a credit facility  which has a floating interest rate  to finance a portion of our operations 
we are not subject to fair value risk resulting from changes in our floating interest rates 
the use of floating rate debt instruments provide a benefit due to downward interest rate movements but does not limit us to exposure from future increases in interest rates 
based on the year end december  outstanding borrowings and a floating interest rate of  a change in interest rate would result in an increase or decrease of interest expense of approximately  on an annual basis 
in the normal course of business we enter into hedging transactions  including commodity price collars  swaps and floors to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements  but not for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the instability of prices and to achieve a more predictable cash flow  we may put in place a hedge on a portion of our production 
while the use of these arrangements may limit the benefit to us of increases in the price of oil and natural gas  it also limits the downside risk of adverse price movements 
as of december  no hedges were in place
