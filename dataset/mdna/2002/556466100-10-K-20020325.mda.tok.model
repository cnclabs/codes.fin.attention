overview since our inception in  we have developed  marketed  licensed and supported comprehensive enterprise software for mid market manufacturers engaged in engineer to order  make to order  assemble to order  make to stock and mixed styles of production 
our principal product  the mademanage r enterprise business system  provides fully integrated solutions automating all business processes used by manufacturers  from selling and design  to manufacturing and distribution  finance and human resources  and customer service and support 
this comprehensive enterprise business system features mademanage enterprise resource planning mm tm erp  mademanage supply chain management mm scm  mademanage customer relationship management mm crm  mademanage business intelligence mm bi  mademanage enterprise portal mm vip  and mademanage enterprise integration mm link 
the system is supported by a host of user services  including mm expert  the web site that provides our customers with internet resources including support services hours per day  seven days a week  cyber consulting  and virtual education courses 
the mademanage enterprise business system is sold in the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
currently  approximately of our revenues are derived from customers in north america 
our revenues are derived from software licenses  services and hardware 
revenue is generally recognized when all contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
software revenues are generated from licensing software to new customers and from licensing additional users and new applications to existing customers 
revenues from software licenses and hardware are recognized upon shipment  delivery or customer acceptance  based upon the substance of the arrangement or as defined in the sales agreement 
services revenues are generated from annual fees paid by customers to receive support services and software upgrades and also from implementation  education and consulting services 
support is typically purchased as part of the initial sales agreement and is renewable annually 
support fees are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
services revenues from implementation  education and consulting services are generally included in the initial agreement 
we recognize revenues from these services as they are performed 
beginning in  virtual and classroom education courses have been offered via mm university  a subscription based education program which is accessible through mm expert and is recognized ratably over the contract term 
subscription revenues from mm vip are reflected in software revenues and are recognized ratably over the subscription period 
hardware revenues are generated primarily from the sale of bar coding and data collection equipment used in connection with the mademanage enterprise business system and constitute a relatively small component of total revenues 
software revenues for a particular quarter depend substantially on orders received and products shipped in that quarter 
furthermore  large orders may be significant to operating income in the quarter in which the corresponding revenue is recognized 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues and percent increase or decrease from the prior period dollar amount represented by certain items included in our statements of operations for the periods indicated

total revenues increased by  or  to million in from million in this increase in revenue was driven by increases in services revenues  partially offset by a decrease in software and hardware revenues 
total revenues increased by million  or  in from million in this increase was in both software and services revenues 
we have not historically recognized significant annual revenues from any single customer 
software revenues 
software license revenues decreased by  or  to million in from million in  which was up from million in software license revenues constituted   and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease in software revenues in from is due to a decrease in sales of additional users and optional modules to our installed base of customers  partially offset by an increase in revenues from licenses to new users 
we believe the weak economy negatively impacted manufacturers discretionary spending for upgrades  while new systems capital expenditures and services were less affected 
the increase in software revenues in over was attributed to an increase in the average order size  which offset the decrease in the number of license transactions 
services revenues 
services revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in  which was up from million in services revenues constituted  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the increases in services revenues were largely due to support fees from an expanding user base 
hardware revenues 
hardware revenues were  in and million in both and hardware revenues constituted  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the hardware equipment sold was bar coding and data collection equipment necessary to utilize certain features of the mademanage enterprise business system 
hardware revenues decreased in compared to due to a decrease in sales to the installed base of customers 
although the number of new system orders decreased  hardware revenues remained flat in due to increased demand for this equipment as a result of continued expansion of the number of customers using our software 
international revenues 
international revenues from our operations in the united kingdom totaled  in and  in for software  hardware and support and represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
there were no international revenues in  as we started our international sales effort in costs of revenues costs of software revenues 
costs of software revenues totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  resulting in gross profits of  and of software revenues  respectively 
the decreases in gross profit percentages were due in part to a greater proportion of software revenues generated from third party products and an increase in sales discounts 
additionally  royalties associated with the upgrade of the mademanage enterprise business system to the microsoft r sql server database were introduced in the third quarter of and are reflected in costs of software revenues 
write down and amortization of purchased technology 
in august  we acquired bridgeware  inc  which gave rise to a purchased technology asset 
during the third quarter of  we decided to accelerate development of an integrated multi level planning suite that is largely replacing the acquired technology 
that decision resulted in an impairment of the purchased technology asset  which was written down to its net realizable value 
the non cash write down and amortization of purchased technology in was million as compared to amortization of  in see operating expenses income tax provision benefit for comparative pro forma results of operations excluding the write down and amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition of bridgeware 
costs of services revenues 
costs of services revenues totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  resulting in gross profits of  and of services revenues  respectively 
the gross profit percentages continue to increase as services and support revenues increase with our expanding customer base 
at the same time  staffing levels decreased in resulting in increased operating efficiencies 
costs of hardware revenues 
costs of hardware revenues totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
gross profits from hardware were  and of hardware revenues in  and  respectively 
restructuring charge 
during the first quarter of  management approved a restructuring plan designed to align our operations with the current technology and economic environment 
elements of the restructuring plan included facilities rationalization as a result of increased market acceptance of our online education offerings  cost reductions associated with mm vip after the significant initial investment made in and employee separations across most functional areas of the company 
in connection with the restructuring  we recorded a million pre tax charge comprised of restructuring liabilities of  of which  was paid as of december   and related asset impairments of  the remaining restructuring liability of  is recorded as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheet and represents our best estimate of non recoverable costs and expenses associated with sublet facilities and guaranteed future royalty payments related to an impaired asset 
the total million pre tax charge in the first quarter was recorded as  in costs of revenues and  in operating expenses 
operating expenses sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in compared to was due primarily to a decrease in headcount and a reduction of travel as more of the selling effort was driven to the web 
the increases in sales and marketing expenses in compared to were primarily due to increased staffing for sales and marketing  marketing activities  including promotional activities  travel expenses related to sales and marketing efforts  costs associated with starting up the international sales effort and costs associated with marketing mm express and mm vip with substantially no offsetting revenues 
product development expenses 
product development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
we did not capitalize any software development costs during these years  since the capitalizable portion was not significant 
we continue to invest heavily in ongoing product development to expand functionality and create next generation products 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
the increase in compared to was due mainly to increased spending for investor relations activities 
the increase in compared to was due primarily to increased headcount 
write down and amortization of goodwill 
in august  we recorded purchased technology and related goodwill associated with the acquisition of our bridgeware subsidiary 
during the third quarter of  we decided to accelerate development of an integrated multi level planning suite that is largely replacing the acquired technology 
that decision resulted in an impairment of the purchased technology asset and related goodwill  which were written down to their net realizable value 
the non cash write down and amortization of goodwill in was  as compared to amortization of  in see operating expenses income tax provision benefit for comparative pro forma results of operations excluding the write down and amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition of bridgeware 
other income  net other income  net was   and  in  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
other income  net principally reflects interest earned on marketable securities 
interest income was   and  in  and  respectively 
interest income decreased in from due to lower interest rates 
income tax provision benefit from and through  we sustained cumulative tax operating losses totaling million  inclusive of two significant charges totaling million related to the write down and amortization of purchased technology assets  described under operating expenses write down and amortization of goodwill  and a restructuring charge  described under costs of revenues restructuring charge 
those losses have given rise to deferred tax assets of million 
although the loss carryforwards substantially do not begin to expire until  current economic conditions make it difficult to predict full recoverability of those tax assets in a period comparable to the period over which they originated 
a valuation allowance was recorded against the million of deferred tax assets to reflect that uncertainty in the fourth quarter of  resulting in a full year income tax provision of million 
furthermore  we do not anticipate recording either tax charges or benefits in the next several quarters due to this charge 
this non cash charge has no effect on our cash and investments  which totaled million at december  on a pro forma basis  exclusive of the tax valuation allowance  restructuring charge and the write down and amortization of intangible assets  results of operations would be comparatively reported as follows year ended december  in thousands  except per share data unaudited total revenues    operating loss    net loss  per share amounts basic and diluted net loss per share weighted average shares outstanding    excludes the restructuring charge and valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
the tax provision assumes a full year effective rate 
excludes the write down and amortization of purchased technology and goodwill recorded in connection with the bridgeware acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations primarily through equity capital  including the initial public offering of common stock in december  and cash generated from operations 
as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the net change in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities was an increase of million in and a reduction of million and million in and  respectively 
at december   we had working capital of million 
accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the average accounts receivable days outstanding dso was days at december   and days as of december  accounts receivable and dso were reduced in due to improved collection efforts through increased automation 
deferred revenue decreased to million at december   from million at december  deferred revenue principally relates to support agreements or contracted services  and the current portion of deferred revenue is expected to be recognized in revenue during the next twelve months 
deferred revenue decreased at the end of compared to due to lower fourth quarter new system sales  a portion of which is deferred for support and other contracted services 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements at least through in the normal course of business  we enter into various contractual commitments that impact the liquidity of our operations 
at december   our commitments consisted of long term operating leases  principally for office space 
furthermore  we have entered into certain sublease agreements as a result of facilities rationalization associated with the increased market acceptance of our online education offerings 
future minimum lease payments required under these non cancelable operating leases  net of receipts from sublease agreements  are as follows in thousands payable in and thereafter less receipts from sublease agreements key accounting policies revenue recognition we provide our customers with software  hardware  customer support services and consulting services 
consistent with other companies that provide similar offerings  revenue recognition is subject to multiple accounting pronouncements including staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop and related interpretations 
our revenue recognition policy is consistent with the requirements of sab  sop and other applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations 
in general  we record revenue when it is realized  or realizable  and earned 
revenues from software licenses and hardware are recognized upon shipment  delivery or customer acceptance  based upon the substance of the arrangement or as defined in the sales agreement provided there are no significant remaining vendor obligations to be fulfilled and collectibility is reasonably assured 
software revenues are generated from licensing software to new customers and from licensing additional users and new applications to existing customers 
hardware revenues are generated primarily from the sale of bar coding and data collection equipment used in connection with the mademanage enterprise business system and constitute a relatively small component of total revenues 
our sales arrangements typically include services in addition to software and hardware 
services revenues are generated from annual fees paid by customers to receive support services and software upgrades and also from implementation  education and consulting services 
for sales arrangements that include bundled software  hardware and services  we account for any undelivered service offering as a separate element of a multiple element arrangement 
these services are usually not essential to the functionality of the software and hardware 
amounts deferred for services are determined based upon vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the elements as prescribed in sop support revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
revenues from technical training and consulting services are recognized as provided to customers 
if the services are essential to the functionality of the software and hardware  revenue from the software and hardware components is deferred until the essential services are complete 
subscription revenues include mm express  mm vip and mm university 
the mm express thin client option is designed to provide mid market manufacturing companies access to the mademanage enterprise business system via the internet through a hosted application service provider 
the mm vip enterprise portal offers manufacturing companies a range of collaborative opportunities with their customers  sales channels and suppliers 
mm university provides flexible  comprehensive educational opportunities to customers via the web and also through traditional classroom training 
subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription period 
use of estimates in the normal course of business  we are required to make significant estimates in preparing our financial statements 
as described in the notes to consolidated financial statements  actual results could differ from the amounts estimated and recorded in such statements 
a description of our more significant estimates follows allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish allowances for doubtful accounts using a combination of specific identification and applying percentages of our accounts receivable balance as an overall proxy to reflect historical average credit losses 
given our experience  we believe that the reserves for potential losses are adequate  but if one or more of our larger customers were to default in its obligations under applicable contractual arrangements  we could be exposed to potential significant losses in excess of the provisions established 
income taxes and valuation allowances 
we estimate our tax liabilities based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which we operate 
our estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes  as well as about the realization of deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance 
if our provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate  if we are unable to realize certain deferred tax assets or if the tax laws change unfavorably  we could experience potential significant losses in excess of the reserves established 
likewise  if our provisions for current and deferred taxes are in excess of those eventually needed  if we are able to realize additional deferred tax assets or if tax laws change favorably  we could experience potential significant gains 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
basis of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of mademanage systems  inc  and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
all material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
we do not have any special purpose entities whose financial results are not included in the consolidated financial statements 
we have not participated in any material transactions with a related party  including members of the board of directors  executive officers  key employees or former employees 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas 
sfas  which supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 business combinations and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises  requires that all business combinations entered into after the effective date of july   be accounted for by the purchase method  defines criteria for recognition of intangible assets apart from goodwill and further defines disclosure requirements for business combinations 
we do not expect this standard to have any material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas provides guidance on the financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets upon their initial acquisition and also subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas states that an intangible asset with a finite useful life should be amortized over that life 
goodwill and an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life should not be amortized  however  they should be tested for impairment at least annually 
consistent with the requirements to implement sfas at the beginning of fiscal years beginning after december   we will adopt the provisions of sfas in the first quarter of at this time  we do not expect this standard to have any material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas  which amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  establishes accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation and its associated asset retirement cost 
the objective of sfas is to provide guidance for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
the retirement obligations included within the scope of this project are those that an entity cannot avoid as a result of either acquisition  construction or normal operation of a long lived asset 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  at this time  we do not expect this standard to have any material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas and amends accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business apb 
this statement develops one accounting model based on the model in sfas for long lived assets that are disposed of by sale  as well as addresses the principal implementation issues 
it eliminates the apb requirement that discontinued operations be measured at net realizable value or that entities include under discontinued operations in the financial statements amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred 
additionally  sfas expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  at this time  we do not expect this standard to have any material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
business environment and risk factors in addition to other information contained in this report  the following factors could affect our actual results and could cause such results to differ materially from those achieved in the past or expressed in our forward looking statements 
fluctuations of quarterly operating results  seasonality we have experienced in the past  and expect to experience in the future  significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
a substantial portion of our revenues in each quarter is from software licenses signed and product shipped in that quarter  and such revenues historically have been recorded largely in the third month of the quarter  with a concentration in the last week of that third month 
accordingly  our quarterly results of operations are difficult to predict  and delays in closings of sales near the end of a quarter or product delivery could cause quarterly revenues and  to a greater degree  net income to fall substantially short of anticipated levels 
in addition  we have experienced a seasonal pattern in our operating results  with the fourth quarter typically having the highest total revenues and operating income and the first quarter having historically reported lower revenues and operating income compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year 
other factors  many of which are beyond our control  that may contribute to fluctuations in quarterly operating results include the size of individual orders  the timing of product introductions or enhancements by us and our competitors  competition and pricing in the manufacturing software industry  market acceptance of new products  reduction in demand for existing products  the shortening of product life cycles as a result of new product introductions by us or our competitors  product quality problems  personnel changes  conditions or events in the manufacturing industry  and general economic conditions 
the sales cycle for the mademanage enterprise business system typically ranges from three to nine months 
however  license signing may be delayed for a number of reasons outside of our control 
since software is generally shipped as orders are received  we have historically operated without significant backlog 
because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  small variations in the timing of revenue recognition can cause a significant fluctuation in operating results from quarter to quarter and may result in unanticipated quarterly earnings shortfalls or losses 
in addition  we may increase operating expenses in anticipation of continued growth and to fund expanded product development efforts 
to the extent such expenses precede  or are not subsequently followed by  increased revenues  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
product and market concentration our revenues are currently derived from licenses of the mademanage enterprise business system and related services and third party software and hardware products 
in the near term  the mademanage enterprise business system and related services are expected to continue to account for the majority of our revenues 
accordingly  any event that adversely affects the sale of the mademanage enterprise business system  such as competition from other products  significant quality problems  negative publicity or evaluation  reduced market acceptance of  or obsolescence of the hardware platforms on  or software environments in which the mademanage enterprise business system operates  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  as our sales of third party software and hardware products have increased  incompatibility with those products could also have a material adverse effect 
our business depends substantially upon the software expenditures of mid market manufacturers  which in part depend upon the demand for such manufacturers products 
an economic slow down or other adverse event affecting manufacturing industries in the united states could impact such demand  causing manufacturers in our target market to curtail or postpone capital expenditures for business information systems 
any adverse change in the amount or timing of software expenditures by our target customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on third party technologies the mademanage enterprise business system uses a variety of third party technologies  including operating systems  tools and other applications developed and supported by microsoft corporation 
the mademanage enterprise business system relies heavily on microsoft visual studio and microsoft sql server 
other microsoft programming tools and applications used by the mademanage enterprise business system include activex  ole  odbc  oledb  msmq  and internet information server 
there can be no assurance that microsoft corporation will continue to support the operating systems  tools and other applications utilized by the mademanage enterprise business system or that they will continue to be widely accepted in our target market 
additionally  we use visual objects from computer associates and certain optimization software from ilog inc we resell various third party products  including microsoft visual foxpro  microsoft sql server  microsoft project  products from powerway  best software  ads inc  interact commerce and frx  and bar code hardware and software 
there can be no assurance that these third party vendors will continue to support these technologies or that these technologies will retain their level of acceptance among manufacturers in our target market 
the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
product development and rapid technological change our growth and future financial performance depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing applications and to develop and introduce new applications to incorporate technological advances that satisfy customer requirements or expectations 
as a result of the complexities inherent in product development  there can be no assurance that either improvements to the mademanage enterprise business system or applications that we develop in the future will be delivered on a timely basis or ultimately accepted in the market 
any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments or end user requirements  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could damage our competitive position and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
internet and potential for subscription revenue business model we believe the internet is changing the way businesses operate and therefore the software needs of our customers 
we believe our customers will increasingly require e business applications and software solutions that will enable them to engage in commerce or service over the internet 
if we are unable to respond to emerging industry standards and technological changes  we may not be able to deliver products and services that meet our customers changing needs 
if we are not successful in addressing these changing needs  our products may become obsolete and our financial results may be materially and adversely impacted 
furthermore  advances in internet and e commerce applications may lead the enterprise business system market to rapid acceptance of application service provider asp  a hosted method of delivering business system solutions 
the asp method of delivery uses a subscription revenue model  and although subscriptions could improve predictability of future revenue  it delays revenue recognition and cash collections as compared to the current method 
therefore  if there is a rapid change to the asp business model  our near term financial results and financial position may be materially and adversely impacted 
dependence on key personnel our success depends to a significant extent upon a number of key employees  including members of senior management 
no employee is subject to an employment contract 
our ability to implement business strategy is substantially dependent on our ability to attract  on a timely basis  and retain skilled personnel  especially sales  service  support and development personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we compete for such personnel with numerous companies  including larger  more established companies with significantly greater financial resources 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of the key employees or the failure to attract and retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
management of growth  international expansion we have experienced growth in our domestic business and operations 
while we have managed this growth to date  there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively do so in the future 
our ability to manage growth successfully is contingent on a number of factors including our ability to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems and to motivate and effectively manage employees 
we have begun to distribute the mademanage enterprise business system in international markets  primarily the united kingdom 
we have no significant experience in international markets  and there can be no assurance that such expansion can be successfully accomplished or that the mademanage enterprise business system will be successfully adapted or accepted in the international markets 
additionally  we rely on our distributor in the united kingdom  ncr corporation  to sell and service the united kingdom market place 
at present  our international plans include only canada and the united kingdom 
risks associated with acquisitions as part of our business strategy  we expect to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing product offerings  augment market coverage  enhance technological capabilities  or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could materially adversely affect operating results and or the price of our common stock 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies and products  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
no assurance can be given as to our ability to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that might be acquired in the future  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
insufficient customer commitment to obtain the benefits of the mademanage enterprise business system  customers must commit resources to implement and manage the product and to train their employees in the use of the product 
the failure of customers to commit sufficient resources to those tasks or to carry them out effectively could result in customer dissatisfaction with the mademanage enterprise business system 
if a significant number of customers became dissatisfied  our reputation could be tarnished and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
competition the enterprise software market is fragmented  intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
we face competition from a variety of software vendors  including application software vendors  software tool vendors and relational database management system vendors 
several large technology companies have recently expanded into the enterprise software market by acquiring established vendors in the market 
additionally  several software companies that have traditionally marketed enterprise software to larger manufacturers have announced initiatives to target mid market manufacturers 
compared to us  many of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential competitors  have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources and a larger base of customers 
there can be no assurance that such competitors will not offer or develop products that are superior to the mademanage enterprise business system or that achieve greater market acceptance 
if such competition were to result in significant price declines or loss of market share for the mademanage enterprise business system  our business  financial condition and results of operation would be adversely affected 
the technologies we use to develop the mademanage enterprise business system are generally available and widely known  including technology developed by microsoft corporation 
the mademanage enterprise business system competes with other products principally on the basis that it is specifically designed for mid market manufacturers  is relatively easy to implement and use  and is supported by a well developed system of service and support 
in addition  we believe that advanced features for messaging and internet access differentiate the mademanage enterprise business system 
we believe that the mademanage enterprise business system compares favorably with the products offered by competitors  but there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against such products or that we will be able to compete successfully against future products 
relationships with value added resellers we distribute our software products through a direct sales force and a network of value added resellers vars 
a significant portion of licenses of the mademanage enterprise business system sold to new customers is sold by vars 
additionally  we rely on our distributor in the united kingdom  ncr corporation  to sell and service the united kingdom market place 
if some or all of the vars reduce their efforts to sell the mademanage enterprise business system  promote competing products or terminate their relationships with us  our business  financial condition and results of operation would be materially and adversely affected 
furthermore  vars frequently develop strong relationships with their customers  so if vars criticize us or our products to their customers  our reputation could be damaged  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
product liability and insufficient insurance we market  sell and support software products used by manufacturers to manage their business operations and to store substantially all of their operational data 
software programs as complex as those we offer may contain undetected errors  despite testing  which are discovered only after the product has been installed and used by customers 
there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in existing or future releases of our software or that any such errors will not impair the market acceptance of these products 
a customer could be required to cease operations temporarily and some or all of its key operational data could be lost or damaged if its information systems fail as the result of human error  mechanical difficulties or quality problems in the mademanage enterprise business system or third party technologies utilized by the mademanage enterprise business system 
we have insurance covering product liability or damages arising from negligent acts  errors  mistakes or omissions  however there can be no assurance that this insurance will be adequate 
additionally  we are subject to other legal proceedings and claims in the normal course of business 
a claim against us  if successful and of a sufficient magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on proprietary rights  risk of infringement we rely primarily on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that competitors will not independently develop products incorporating technology that is substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
we have a united states patent for software related to materials requirements planning regeneration and patent applications pending for software included in the mademanage enterprise business system related to a navigational interface and an e commerce hosting approach for the enterprise 
however  we have no other patents or patent applications pending  and existing copyright laws afford only limited protection 
in the event that we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that our technology infringes on the intellectual property of third parties  that we would prevail against any such claims or that a licensing agreement will be available on reasonable terms in the event of an unfavorable ruling on any such claim 
any such claim  with or without merit  would likely be time consuming and expensive to defend and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
substantial control by single shareholder as of march   hambrecht quist california and hambrecht quist london ventures the entities affiliated with jp morgan chase co  inc beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  the entities affiliated with jp morgan chase co  inc  will be able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions
