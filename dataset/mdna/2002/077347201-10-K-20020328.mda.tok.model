item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto 
the discussion of results  causes and trends should not be construed to infer any conclusion that such results  causes or trends will necessarily continue in the future 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  investments  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company makes purchasing decisions principally based upon firm sales orders from customers  the availability and pricing of raw materials and projected customer requirements 
future events that could adversely affect these decisions and result in significant charges to the company s operations include slow down in customer demand as the company is currently experiencing  customers delaying the issuance of sales orders to the company  miscalculating customer requirements  technology changes which render the raw materials and finished goods obsolete  and cancellation or loss of customers and or cancellation of sales orders 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon the aforementioned assumptions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company seeks sales and profit growth by expanding its existing customer base  developing new products and by pursuing strategic acquisitions that meet the company s criteria relating to the market for the products  the company s ability to efficiently manufacture the product  synergies that are created by the acquisition  and a purchase price that represents fair value 
if the company s evaluation of a target company misjudges its technology  estimated future sales and profitability levels  or inability to keep pace with the latest technology  these factors could impair the value of the investment  which could materially adversely affect the company s profitability 
the company files income tax returns in every jurisdiction in which it has reason to believe it is subject to tax 
historically  the company has been subject to examination by various taxing jurisdictions

although all product lines experienced sales decreases except for integrated connector modules icm  the telecommunications and networking segments were particularly depressed 
the company is experiencing both volume reductions and price degradation as the number of manufacturers with saleable products increases and customers take aggressive price positions 
several of the company s customers are facing difficult market conditions 
some customers have delayed purchase orders  while others have cancelled purchase orders outright 
certain customers continue to have surplus inventories  thereby reducing their need for the company s products

cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased from in to in the increase in the cost of sales percentage is primarily attributable to a million inventory write off of surplus and obsolete inventory and non cancelable purchase commitments

additionally  the company incurred a charge during the fourth quarter of in the total amount of million for the write down of fixed assets due to changing customer preferences and projected lower volumes in mature product lines and other charges related to the consolidation of the company s engineering facilities 
also contributing to the increase in cost of sales are manufacturing inefficiencies due to reduced sales volume and sales with lower or no gross profit margins 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in the decrease is primarily attributable to lower labor and factory overhead expenses  the move of telcom production to the far east from texas during the fourth quarter of and higher sales volume which results in greater manufacturing efficiencies offset  in part  by higher raw material content associated with the current sales mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses the percentage relationship of selling  general and administrative expenses to net sales increased from in to in the company attributes the percentage increase primarily to decreased sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in dollar amount by approximately 
the company attributes the decrease in dollar amount of such expenses to reduced sales and marketing salaries and related expenses  offset in part by a salary continuance of approximately  due under the terms of the late chairman of the board s employment agreement and a charge in the amount of  related to the modification of the terms of certain non qualified incentive stock options held by the estate of the chairman of the board

if the unrepatriated earnings were distributed to the parent corporation rather than reinvested in the far east  such funds would be subject to united states federal income taxes 
management has identified million of foreign earnings that may not be permanently reinvested 
deferred income taxes in the amount of approximately million have been provided on such earnings 
million during  million during and million during and prior years 
the company files income tax returns in every jurisdiction in which it has reason to believe it is subject to tax 
historically  the company has been subject to examination by various taxing jurisdictions

nonetheless  any tax jurisdiction may contend that a filing position claimed by the company regarding one or more of its transactions is contrary to that jurisdiction s laws or regulations 
the provision benefit for income taxes for was  as compared to  for the decrease in the provision is due primarily to foreign losses arising from inventory writedowns  united states and foreign losses arising from fixed asset write offs and severance related expenses in and lower united states taxes resulting from the gain on the sale of marketable securities in versus offset in part by pretax profit in before these charges

cost control measures in light of the current market in the company s industry  the company continues to review its operating structures in efforts to control costs 
such measures can be expected to result in a consolidation of the company s operations and the recognition of related charges in future periods 
the company expects to incur additional severance and employee relocation charges of up to approximately million net of taxes during the first nine months of the description of this expectation constitutes a forward looking statement 
actual results could differ materially from such expectation as a result of a number of factors  including the company s ability to effect its relocation plans  the economic condition of the company s industry and other factors that relate to the extent to which the company is able to restore its profitability 
inflation during the past two years  the effect of inflation on the company s profitability was not material 
historically  fluctuations of the us dollar against other major currencies have not significantly affected the company s foreign operations as most transactions have been denominated in us dollars or currencies linked to the us dollar 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has financed its capital expenditures through cash flows from operating activities 
management believes that the cash flow from operations  combined with its existing capital base and the company s available lines of credit  will be sufficient to fund its operations for the near term 
such statement constitutes a forward looking statement 
factors which could cause the company to require additional capital include  among other things  a further softening in the demand for the company s existing products  an inability to respond to customer demand for new products  potential acquisitions requiring substantial capital  future expansion of the company s operations and net losses that could result in net cash being used in operating  investing and or financing activities which result in net decreases in cash and cash equivalents
