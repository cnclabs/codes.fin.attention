item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our discussion and analysis of laserscope s financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows are based upon laserscope s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory valuation and obsolescence  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty obligation  excess and obsolete inventory  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  functional currency  and income tax revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue from primarily two sources i product revenue which includes lasers  instrumentation  and disposables  and ii service revenue 
the company recognizes revenue on products and services when the persuasive evidence of an arrangement is in place  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and title and risk of ownership has been transferred 
transfer of title and risk of ownership generally occurs when the product is shipped to the customer or when the customer receives the product  depending on the nature of the arrangement 
the company currently provides for the estimated cost to repair or replace products under warranty at the time of sale 
service revenue is recognized as the services are provided and for service contracts on a pro rata basis over the period of the applicable service contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we assess the credit worthiness of our customers prior to making a sale in order to mitigate the risk of loss from customers not paying us 
however  to account for the inevitability that a customer may not pay us  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate losses based on the overall business climate  our accounts receivable aging profile  and an analysis of the circumstances associated with specific accounts which are past due 
despite the significant amount of analysis used to compute the required allowance  if the financial condition of laserscope s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty obligation 
we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers 
in addition to these proactive measures  we also provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we estimate the cost of our warranty obligation based on product failure rates over the last twelve months and the actual material usage and service delivery costs experienced in correcting those failures 
however  should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 

table of contents excess and obsolete inventory 
we maintain reserves for our estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory 
the reserves are equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
if cash generated in the future by the acquired asset is different from current estimates  or if the appropriate discount rate were to change  then the net present value of the asset would be impacted  and this could result in a charge to earnings 
functional currency 
we have a foreign subsidiary in france which sells to customers in france  and we also have a subsidiary in the uk which sells to customers in all of europe  except france  as well as customers in pacific rim countries 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records into united states dollars 
our two subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in their functional currencies which are also their respective local currencies  the euro and the british pound sterling 
the functional currency is determined based on management judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of it transactions  including billing  financing  payroll  and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations must also be considered 
since our two subsidiaries functional currencies are deemed to be the local currencies  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of those subsidiaries financial statements is included in cumulative translation adjustments 
if in the future we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary from its local currency to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our statement of operations 
income tax 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
due to a history of operating losses  management believes that there is sufficient uncertainty regarding the realization of deferred tax assets and a full valuation allowance is appropriate 

table of contents financial review results of operations the following table sets forth certain data from laserscope s consolidated statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of net revenues net revenues cost of products and services gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative operating income loss interest income expense and other  net income loss before income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes income loss before minority interest minority interest net income loss we sell our products to hospitals  outpatient surgery centers  pay per use providers and individual physicians in the united states  europe  the middle east  latin america and the pacific rim 
in the united states we sell through our direct sales force as well as through a distributor  mckesson corporation medical group 
we also generate export sales through our wholly and majority owned subsidiaries in the united kingdom and france and by independent distributors in the rest of the world 
we operate in a technologically advanced  dynamic and highly competitive environment 
our future operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
while we attempt to identify and respond to these conditions in a timely manner  these conditions represent significant risks to our performance 
international sales accounted for  and of our net revenues for  and  respectively 
we believe that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues in the foreseeable future 
a large portion of our international sales occur through our foreign subsidiaries and the remainder result from exports to foreign distributors 
our international sales and operations are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally 
these risks could harm our financial condition  results of operations and future cash flows 
through december   sales outside of the united states have been denominated in the local currencies of the united kingdom and france and in us dollars for the rest of the world 
prior to  sales in germany were denominated in german marks 
however  we are exposed to foreign currency risk in a number of areas 
although our revenues denominated in us dollars represented over of total revenues in  in and in  market risk exists in foreign countries where we sell in us dollars  and where a major strengthening of the us dollar could have a material negative impact on our business 
in addition  the introduction of the euro as a currency in several european countries may negatively affect our ability to sell our products in exchange for us dollars in those countries 
in january  our subsidiary in france began to denominate its sales and report its financial statements in the euro 
through  we had not sustained any material adverse impact from the introduction of the euro 
however  any major strengthening of the us dollar against the euro or the british pound sterling could have a material adverse impact on our business 
please refer to the risk factors section of this annual report for further discussion on these and other risks associated with our business

b we sold our nwl subsidiary effective january  results compared to during  total revenues decreased approximately million  or  from during  revenues from the sales of laser equipment decreased to million  or of total net revenues  compared to million  or  of total net revenues in decreases in revenues from sales of laser equipment resulted from higher unit shipments at lower average selling prices due to higher aesthetic laser shipments and lower non aesthetic laser shipments in than in the us distributor relationship which we formed with mckesson corporation effective december contributed to the higher aesthetic laser sales 
we believe that we will continue to see moderate increases in our sales of lower priced office based aesthetic lasers in all geographic markets 
in  we believe that overall laser sales will increase due to sales of our new laser for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia  which we began to ship for revenue in january net revenues from shipments of disposable supplies and instrumentation were higher in than  and were approximately million  or  of total revenues in  compared to approximately million  or of total revenues in the increase is principally due to higher sales of scanning equipment and hand pieces for use with our aesthetic lasers due to a higher volume of aesthetic lasers sold 
this increase was offset partially by reduced shipments of disposable fiber optic devices for hospital surgical procedures in the united states and the pacific rim 
during the past several years  our sales have trended towards lower priced office lasers for aesthetic procedures and away from lasers used in hospitals for non aesthetic procedures 
this has resulted in lower sales of disposable supplies since office lasers used in aesthetic procedures  although carrying one time sales of instrumentation  generally do not create a stream of sales of disposable supplies 
we believe that our future sales of instrumentation and disposable supplies depend on our ability to increase our installed base of systems and also to develop and promote surgical procedures that use these products 
service revenues during were higher than these revenues were million  or  of total net revenues in  compared to million  or  of total net revenues in the increase is primarily due to higher service revenues at our foreign subsidiaries partly offset by marginally lower service 
table of contents revenues in the us we believe that future revenues will depend on increases to the installed base of lasers as well as the acceptance of service contracts by our customers 
product gross margin as a percentage of net product revenues was in compared to in the increase reflects a continued shift in sales mix toward higher margin aesthetic laser product sales versus lower margin surgical product sales 
we expect that product gross margin  as a percentage of net revenues in  will be at levels similar to however  we expect that these amounts may vary from quarter to quarter during and will depend on product demand and distribution mix 
gross margin from service activities as a percentage of net service revenues was in compared to in the decrease reflects an increase in overhead costs for material and labor relative to revenue 
we expect that gross margin  as a percentage of net revenues from service activities in  will be similar to levels 
research and development expenses result from activities related to the development of new laser  instrumentation and disposable products and the enhancement of our existing products 
in  amounts spent on research and development increased from amounts spent in the increase was due to final efforts necessary to bring the niagara laser to market 
we expect that amounts spent in research and development during will  as a percentage of net revenues  be marginally lower than that which was spent in selling  general and administrative expenses increased in compared to the increase in spending primarily results from increased sales expenses as we increased our selling efforts 
we expect a similar increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during as we continue to invest in educational support as well as marketing programs for the niagara and other lasers 
in we recorded an income tax provision of  because of the profitability of our uk subsidiary 
the us and french entities reported net losses in and both have significant net operating loss carry forwards 
consequently  no income tax provision was recorded for these entities in in we recorded no income tax provision due to the availability of net operating loss carry forwards 
due to a history of operating losses  management believes that there is sufficient uncertainty regarding the realization of deferred tax assets and a full valuation allowance is appropriate in and for our entities that had net operating losses 
results compared to during  total revenues decreased approximately million  or  from the majority of the decrease resulted from the sale of our nwl subsidiary effective january  in  sales of nwl products and services contributed million in revenue while we had no sales of nwl products and services in during  revenues from the sales of non nwl laser equipment decreased to million  or of total net revenues  compared to million  or  of total net revenues in decreases in revenues from sales of laser equipment resulted from higher unit shipments at lower average selling prices due to an increased number of aesthetic lasers sold 
net revenues from shipments of non nwl disposable supplies and instrumentation were higher in than  and were approximately million  or  of total revenues in  compared to approximately million  or of total revenues in the increase is principally due to higher sales of scanning equipment and hand pieces for use with our aesthetic lasers 
this increase was offset partially by reduced shipments of disposable fiber optic devices for hospital surgical procedures in the united states and the pacific rim 
non nwl service revenues during were higher than these revenues were million  or  of total net revenues in  compared to million  or  of total net revenues in the increase is primarily due to higher domestic service contract revenues 

table of contents product gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was in compared to in the increase reflects a combination of higher margins on aesthetic laser product sales  the elimination of lower margin nwl product sales in and charges recorded to provide for inventory related to discontinued product lines totaling million in gross margin from service activities as a percentage of service revenues was in compared to in the increase reflects continued overhead reduction 
in  amounts spent on research and development excluding nwl s research and development decreased from amounts spent in the decline was due to our continued narrowing of focus in product development activity with fewer products in development 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in compared to the decrease in spending primarily results from the sale of nwl and continuation of expense reduction measures implemented in july in we recorded no income tax provision due to the availability of net operating loss carry forwards 
in we recorded  in income tax provisions primarily attributable to the profits of nwl 
minority interest in resulted from the minority ownership participation in nwl s net results 
financial review liquidity and capital resources the following table contains selected balance sheet information at december  and in thousands december  december  cash and cash equivalents total assets working capital the net increase in cash and cash equivalents in compared to was due primarily to operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities in totaled million 
this was the combined result of the following sources increases in accounts payable million  accrued compensation million  and warranty million  as well as depreciation million  amortization of debt issuance costs million  and a decrease in accounts receivable million 
these sources were partly offset by the following uses net loss of million  as well as increases in inventories million  and prepayments and other current assets million 
cash used in investing activities totaled million and consisted of capital expenditures million 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million and consisted of a net increase in line of credit borrowings million  and proceeds from the sale of common stock under stock plans million 
these sources were offset by payments on obligations under capital leases million 
laserscope has in place an asset based line of credit which provides up to million in borrowings and expires in september credit is extended based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
at december   we had approximately million in borrowing capacity available against million borrowed and million in letter of credit reserve requirements 
this left us with  of unused borrowing capacity 
laserscope s assets collateralize the credit line which bears an interest rate equivalent to the bank s prime rate plus per annum in december 
borrowings against the line of credit are paid down as the company collects its accounts receivable 
provisions of the bank loan agreement prohibit the payment of dividends on non preferred stock  or the redemption  retirement  repurchase or other acquisition of laserscope stock 
the agreement further requires us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth 
as of december   we complied with all covenants 

table of contents capital expenditures totaled million and million in and  respectively 
these expenditures were primarily for computer systems and leasehold improvements 
we expect capital expenditures in to be at levels similar to to address our capital needs  on january  we completed a private placement of our common stock providing net proceeds of approximately million to accredited investors  of which million was received in we issued million shares of our no par value common stock at a price of per share 
we also issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
on february   we completed a private placement of million of subordinate convertible debentures to affiliates of renaissance capital group  inc  with net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the debentures mature seven years from issuance and bear an annual interest rate of 
the debentures are convertible into laserscope common stock with an initial conversion price  which is subject to adjustment  of 
the private placement also included warrants convertible into  shares of our common stock 
there are covenants associated with the debentures for debt to equity ratio  current ratio  and interest coverage 
if we were unable to satisfy any of these covenants  then we would be in default and the lender would have the right to exercise various remedies including declaring due all outstanding principal and interest 
the interest coverage ratio requirement is for the trailing twelve months  and as of december  our interest coverage was future ability to meet the interest coverage requirement will depend primarily on our ability to generate profits 
the debt to equity requirement is a maximum of  and the current ratio requirement is a minimum of as of december  we were in compliance with the provisions of the covenants 
future payments due under debt and lease obligations as of december  in thousands is as follows operating capital debentures line of credit leases leases total and after total we anticipate that future changes in cash and working capital will be dependent on a number of factors including our ability to effectively manage non cash assets such as inventory and accounts receivable  our ability to anticipate and adapt to the changes in our industry such as new and alternative medical procedures  our level of profitability  and our determination to acquire or invest in products and businesses complementary to ours 
we have historically financed acquisitions using our existing cash resources 
while we believe our existing cash resources  including our bank line of credit will be sufficient to fund our operating needs for the next twelve months  additional financing will be required for our currently envisioned long term needs 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
in addition  future equity financings could result in dilution to our shareholders  and future debt financings could result in certain financial and operational restrictions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on investments  outstanding debt balances and foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency values 

table of contents interest rate risk laserscope s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our outstanding debt 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in   or we invest excess cash in money market funds 
our debt financing consists of convertible debentures and bank loans requiring either fixed or variable rate interest payments 
investments in and borrowings under both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
on the investment side  fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
in addition  our future investment income may fall short of securities analyst expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
on the debt side  borrowings that require fixed rate interest payments require greater than current market rate interest payments if interest rates fall  while floating rate borrowings may require greater interest payments if interest rates rise 
additionally  our future interest expense may be greater than expected due to changes in interest rates 
the following table presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our convertible debenture obligations as of december  and average principal interest rate s and beyond foreign currency risk international revenues were of total revenues in the year ended december   compared to of total revenues during the comparable period in our international sales are made through international distributors and wholly owned subsidiaries with payments to us typically denominated in the local currencies of the united kingdom and france  and in us dollars in the rest of the world 
we intend to continue our operations outside of the united states and potentially to enter additional international markets 
these activities  require significant management attention and financial resources and further subject us to the risks of operating internationally 
these risks include  but are not limited to changes in regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  customs  tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
we are also subject to general geopolitical risks in connection with our international operations  such as differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 

table of contents in addition  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our ability to compete in terms of price against products denominated in local currencies 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by changes in these regulatory  geopolitical and other factors 
we do not engage in hedging transactions for speculative or trading purposes
