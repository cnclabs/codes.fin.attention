item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ingles  a leading supermarket chain in the southeast  operates supermarkets in georgia  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee  virginia and alabama 
the company locates its supermarkets primarily in suburban areas  small towns and rural communities 
ingles supermarkets offer customers a wide variety of nationally advertised food products  including grocery  meat and dairy products  produce  frozen foods and other perishables and non food products  including health and beauty care products and general merchandise  as well as quality private label items 
in addition  the company focuses on selling high growth  high margin products to its customers through the development of book sections  media centers  floral departments  bakery departments and prepared foods including delicatessen sections 
the company recently began adding fuel centers and pharmacies at select store locations 
as of september  the company operates in store pharmacies and fuel centers 
ingles also operates two other lines of business  fluid dairy processing and shopping center rentals 
the fluid dairy processing segment sells approximately of its products to the retail grocery segment and approximately of its products to third parties 
real estate ownership including the shopping center rental segment is an important component of the company s operations  providing both operational and economic benefit 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of ingles financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgements  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
self insurance the company is self insured for workers compensation and group medical and dental benefits 
risks and uncertainties are associated with self insurance  however  the company has limited its exposure by maintaining excess liability coverages 
self insurance reserves are established based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
the estimates are based on data provided by the respective claims administrators 
the majority of the company s properties are self insured for casualty losses and business interruption  however  liability coverage is maintained 
asset impairments the company has accounted for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
and  beginning in fiscal  will account for it in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
for assets to be held and used  the company tests for impairment using undiscounted cash flows and calculates the amount of impairment using discounted cash flows 
for assets held for sale  impairment is recognized based on the excess of remaining book value over expected recovery value 
the recovery value is the fair value as determined by independent quotes or expected sales prices developed by internal specialists 
estimates of future cash flows and expected sales prices are judgements based upon the company s experience and knowledge of local operations and cash flows that are projected for several years into the future 
these estimates can fluctuate significantly due to changes in real estate market conditions  the economic environment  capital spending decisions and inflation 
closed store accrual for properties to be closed that are under long term lease agreements  the present value of any remaining liability under the lease  discounted using risk free rates and net of expected sublease recovery  is recognized as a liability and expensed 
if the real estate and leasing markets change  sublease recovery could vary significantly from the recoveries originally assumed  resulting in a material change in the company s recorded liability
