the standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
the standard is effective for the company beginning january  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements

euro conversion as part of the european economic and monetary union emu  a single currency the euro will replace the national currencies of most of the european countries in which the company conducts business 
the conversion rates between the euro and the participating nations currencies have been fixed irrevocably as of january   with the participating national currencies being removed from circulation between january  and june  and replaced by euro notes and coinage 
during the transition period from january  through december   public and private entities as well as individuals could pay for goods and services using either checks  drafts  or wire transfers denominated in euro or the participating country s national currency 
under the regulations governing the transition to a single currency  there is a no compulsion  no prohibition rule which states that no one is obliged to utilize the euro until the notes and coinage have been introduced on january  in keeping with this rule  the company has been euro compliant able to receive euro denominated payments and able to invoice in euro as requested by vendors and suppliers  respectively as of january  in the affected countries 
full conversion of all affected country operations to euro has been completed as of january  market risk sensitivity the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
the company has a formal policy that prohibits the use of currency derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the policy permits the use of financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that may arise in the normal course of the company s business 
currently  the company does not use interest rate derivatives 
the counterparties in derivative transactions are major financial institutions with ratings of a or better  as determined by one of the major credit rating services 
the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency loans principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  thereby limiting the company s risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
during  the principal transactions hedged were short term intercompany sales 
the periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency loans correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency loans and the offsetting losses and gains on hedged transactions are reflected in the company s statement of operations 
a large percentage of the company s sales are transacted in local currencies 
as a result  the company s international operating results are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
a percent strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against every applicable foreign currency could have had a  impact on the revenues of the company 
the company does not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge expected revenues 
however  the company sources a portion of its raw materials in local currencies 
a percent strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against every applicable local content currency would act as a partial offset to the impact on revenues 
the company  which manufactures a significant portion of its products at its mexico facility and by third parties  generally invoices its international subsidiaries in their local currency for finished and semi finished goods 
as a result  the company s annual us dollar cash flow is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
a percent strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against every applicable currency could have had an  impact on the value of the realized cash remittances from its subsidiaries 
the company routinely uses foreign exchange contracts to hedge cash flows that are either firm commitments or those which may be forecasted to occur 
while components and supplies are generally available from a variety of sources  the company presently depends on a single source or a limited number of suppliers for several components of its equipment  certain subassemblies and certain of its products 
this may have an adverse effect on the company s ability to deliver its products or to deliver its products on time or to manufacture its products at anticipated cost levels 
however  due to the general availability of components and supplies  the company does not believe that the loss of any supplier or subassembly manufacturer would have a long term material adverse effect on its business  although set up costs and delays could occur in the short term if the company changes any single source supplier 
in an effort to hedge foreign currency losses on intercompany receivables  the company has the equivalent of  of borrowings outstanding in various foreign currencies at december  substantially all of the remaining company debt is us dollar denominated 
at year end  about percent of all indebtedness to third parties was floating rate based 
although the company has exposure to rising and falling interest rates  a percent rise in rates on current year floating rate based borrowings would have had a adverse impact on pre tax earnings 
during  the company did not use interest rate derivatives to protect its exposure to interest rate market movements 
the company currently holds an investment in cisco common stock  which is accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these equity securities are classified as either trading or available for sale based on how they are utilized in the sails arrangement 
they are carried at fair market value based on their quoted market price 
as such  the company has exposure to market risk related to the fluctuation of cisco s stock price 
however  the change in fair value of the cisco stock price is mitigated by the change in fair value of the embedded equity collar contained in the sails arrangement
