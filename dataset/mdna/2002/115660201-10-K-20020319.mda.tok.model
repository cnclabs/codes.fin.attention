item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations was based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in response to sec release no 
 cautionary advise regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to oil and gas revenues  bad debts  oil and gas properties  marketable securities  income taxes  derivatives  contingencies and litigation  and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s financial statements successful efforts method of accounting the company accounts for its natural gas and crude oil exploration and development activities utilizing the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  costs of productive exploratory wells  development dry holes and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized 
gas and oil lease acquisition costs are also capitalized 
exploration costs  including personnel costs  certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for gas and oil leases  are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized  but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities 
the sale of a partial interest in a proved property is accounted for as a cost recovery and no gain or loss is recognized as long as this treatment does not significantly affect the unit of production amortization rate 
a gain or loss is recognized for all other sales of producing properties 
the application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred 
the results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience 
wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive and actually deliver gas and oil in quantities insufficient to be economic  which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date 
wells are drilled that have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature and an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results 
delineation seismic incurred to select development locations within an oil and gas field is typically considered a development cost and capitalized but often these seismic programs extend beyond the reserve area considered proved and management must estimate the portion of the seismic costs to expense 
the evaluation of gas and oil leasehold acquisition costs requires managerial judgment to estimate the fair value of these costs with reference to drilling activity in a given area 
drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn leasehold positions 
the successful efforts method of accounting can have a significant impact on the operational results reported when the company is entering a new exploratory area in hopes of finding a gas and oil field that will be the focus of future development drilling activity 
the initial exploratory wells may be unsuccessful and will be expensed 
seismic costs can be substantial which will result in additional exploration expenses when incurred 
reserve estimates the company s estimates of gas and oil reserves  by necessity  are projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of gas and oil that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable gas and oil reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future gas and oil prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover gas costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to an extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of gas and oil attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of the company s gas and oil properties and or the rate of depletion of the gas and oil properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to the company s reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
impairment of gas and oil properties the company reviews its gas and oil properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value 
the company estimates the expected future cash flows of its gas and oil properties and compares such future cash flows to the carrying amount of the gas and oil properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  the company will adjust the carrying amount of the gas and oil properties to their fair value 
the factors used to determine fair value include  but are not limited to  estimates of proved reserves  future commodity pricing  future production estimates  anticipated capital expenditures  and a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected 
there were no impairments of gas and oil properties in  or given the complexities associated with gas and oil reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the gas and oil markets  events may arise that would require the company to record an impairment of the recorded book values associated with gas and oil properties 
in  the company recognized an impairment of million primarily as a result of the market prices in effect at that time and there can be no assurance that impairments will not be required in the future 
results of operations the company s results of operations were favorably impacted in  and due to the acquisition of stellarton in january and the mid acquisition of properties and a gas processing plant from unocal 
these acquisitions  continued successful drilling results and increased cash flows which resulted from higher production and commodity prices in and contributed significantly to the operating results for these periods 
revenues during  revenues from gas  oil and natural gas liquids production increased to million  as compared to million in this increase was the result of i an increase in average gas prices received by the company from per mcf in to per mcf in  which increased revenues million  ii a decrease in average oil and natural gas liquids prices received from to which decreased revenues million  iii gas sales volumes increased by to bcf which increased revenues by million  and iv an increase in oil and natural gas liquids sales volumes of to million barrels  which increased revenues by million 
revenues in were also impacted by cash gains realized from hedging activities 
the nymex collar and swap transactions considered effective hedges and settled in  resulted in cash gains of million  which were included in gas and oil sales 
at december   the company had no open hedge or derivative positions 
there was no material hedging activity in or the revenues contributed by the stellarton transaction for the period subsequent to the closing date of january  were million 
during  revenues from gas  oil and natural gas liquids production increased to million  as compared to million in such increase was the result of an increase in i average gas prices received by the company from per mcf in to per mcf in  which increased revenues million  ii average oil and natural gas liquids prices received from to which increased revenues million  iii gas sales volumes increased by to bcf which increased revenues by million due primarily to the unocal acquisition and to successful drilling results  and iv oil and natural gas liquids sales volumes of to million barrels  which increased revenues by million due primarily to the impact of a full year s operations from the unocal acquisition

incremental revenues were recognized in as a result of the ownership of these gathering and processing assets which previously were owned by the company through the wildhorse partnership 
a number of non strategic gathering and processing assets were sold throughout gathering and processing revenue will be impacted in as a result of these dispositions 
tbi field services  inc tbifs was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of tom brown  inc to administer the gathering and processing assets 
incremental volumes gathered by tbifs from the wind river basin where the company has significant production base also contributed to the increase in revenues 
net marketing and trading income increased from a net loss in to a profitable gross margin of million in and million in this was attributable to i a general increase in the company s natural gas marketing operations  ii an increase in the volume of gas marketed for third parties and iii lower transportation rates 
in  the company benefited from certain term and spot natural gas sales at more favorable rates than were available in the market 
drilling revenue associated with the company s wholly owned subsidiary  sauer  increased in to million and to million in due to higher rig utilization rates and increased day rates resulting from the general increase in activity within the oil and gas industry in and costs and expenses expenses related to gas and oil production increased from to due primarily to the stellarton acquisition and increased production levels in on an mcfe basis  gas and oil production costs remained relatively flat at

in expenses related to gas and oil production increased from to due primarily to the acquisition of gas and oil properties and a cyrogenic natural gas processing plant in july from unocal 
on an mcfe basis  gas and oil production costs increased to 
in from 
in  due primarily to the cost of operating the plant 
taxes on gas and oil production decreased by or million in despite a or million increase in revenue from gas  oil and natural gas liquids for this relationship resulted from the inclusion of million of canadian revenues in the results which are not subject to severance and other taxes typically incurred in the united states 
additionally  million realized on the natural gas hedge transactions was included in gas and oil sales in which is not subject to production related taxes 
the company also obtained a refund in of a portion of the production taxes paid in prior years which reduced the expenses reported 
taxes on gas and oil production increased in directly related to the increase in gas  oil and natural gas liquids sales in these periods 
the taxes for and remained relatively constant as a percentage of sales 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million in as compared to approximately million of this increase was associated with the depletion recorded on the stellarton assets acquired in january the production increase of on a mcfe basis on the domestic properties for also increased depreciation  depletion and amortization 
to a lessor extent  the increased cost associated with finding new proved reserves increased the depletion rate in depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million in  as compared to the increase was primarily due to increased production  partially offset by a increase in reserve quantities resulting from upward revisions in the estimated reserve quantities recognized in gathering and processing costs principally represents gas purchased in conjunction with the gas gathering operation to replace gas physically lost in the transmission process and all other costs associated with operating and maintaining the gathering and processing systems 
this expense increased in and the last month of  due to the ownership of the gathering operations after the wildhorse distribution  increased activity in the gathering operations and as a result of the increase in the commodity price for natural gas during this period 
expenses associated with the company s exploration activities were million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
the company s increased exploration efforts in resulted in increased dryhole costs and seismic related expenses 
capital expenditures of million were incurred in which included million associated with the stellarton acquisition 
the exploration  development and land related expenditures were million  an increase of in comparison to in  the unocal acquisition was completed at a cost of million and the exploration  development and land related expenditures were million 
general and administrative expenses have increased from year to year as a result of the company s increased level of operations 
on an mcfe basis  general and administrative expenses were   and 
for the years  and  respectively 
included in the expenses for was a million 
per mcfe pre tax charge recorded in the first quarter of associated with the retirement of donald l 
evans  previously tom brown  inc s chairman and ceo 
mr 
evans received a million retirement payment and the company recognized a million non cash charge in conjunction with the acceleration of mr 
evans stock options 
general and administrative expenses related to stellarton contributed million 
per mcfe to the increase from expenses also increased due to the addition of personnel necessary to accomplish the increase in the capital expenditure programs 
interest expense increased million in due to the increase in debt associated with financing the stellarton transaction 
the increased debt levels in resulting from this transaction benefited from the general reduction in interest rates during this period 
the company s effective interest rate under its credit facility was at december  and at december  interest expense increased 
million in to million as compared to million in due to an increase in interest rates in the company recorded income tax provisions of million  million and million in   and  respectively  resulting in effective tax rates of  and  respectively 
at december   the company has a net operating loss carryforward available for us federal tax purposes of million and a net operating loss carryforward available to reduce future canadian federal income taxes of   cdn 
additionally  statutory depletion carryforwards of approximately million and million of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards are available in the us to offset future taxes 
based upon the operating results for and the present economic environment for the oil and gas industry  the company believes that it will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize these carryforwards 
capital resources and liquidity growth and acquisitions the company continues to pursue opportunities which will add value by increasing its reserve base and presence in significant natural gas areas  and further developing the company s ability to control and market the production of natural gas 
as the company continues to evaluate potential acquisitions and property development opportunities  it will benefit from its financing flexibility and the leverage potential of the company s overall capital structure 
the company does not conduct its business through special purpose entities or have any exposure to off balance sheet financing arrangements 
capital and exploration expenditures the company s capital and exploration expenditures and sources of financing for the years ended december   and are as follows in millions capital and exploration expenditures acquisitions stellarton sauer drilling company unocal other rocky mountain assets other exploration costs development costs acreage gas gathering and processing other financing sources common stock issued net long term bank debt debt assumed on stellarton transaction advances from gas purchasers proceeds from sale of assets cash flow from operations before changes in working capital working capital and other the company anticipates capital and exploration expenditures between to million in  to million allocated to exploration and development activity 
the timing of most of the company s capital expenditures is discretionary and there are no material long term commitments associated with the company s capital expenditure plans 
consequently  the company is able to adjust the level of its capital expenditures as circumstances warrant 
the level of capital expenditures by the company will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors 
historically  the company has funded capital expenditures and working capital requirements with both internally generated cash  borrowings and stock transactions 
net cash flow provided by operating activities after changes in working capital was million for as compared to million and million in and  respectively 
net cash flow in was impacted by the receipt of million from gas purchasers as advances in in july  the company completed an acquisition of substantially all of the rocky mountain oil and gas assets of unocal corporation for million shares of common stock and million in cash 
property sales in  million in cash proceeds were derived from property sales 
in may  the company sold its interest in oil and gas properties located in oklahoma 
these properties had a net book basis of million 
this transaction resulted in a gain of l million with net cash proceeds of million 
cash proceeds of million were also realized in conjunction with several sales transactions in associated with the disposition of gathering and processing facilities received in the wildhorse distribution in november as the systems sold were non strategic to the company s operations and these divestitures were anticipated as part of the wildhorse integration process  the proceeds derived on these transactions were recorded as a reduction to the investment in the gathering assets 
advance from gas purchasers the company sold mmbtu per day of gas for delivery  but was paid million for the gas in the fourth quarter of as described within the notes to the financial statements 
the proceeds from the sale were used to repay bank debt 
debt contractual obligations in addition to the bank credit facility discussed in the following note  the company had various other contractual obligations as of december  the following table lists the company s significant liabilities at december  including the credit facility payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years after years total in thousands bank credit facility    operating leases    transportation commitments     processing commitment      drilling obligation    total contractual cash obligations      the company leases its corporate offices in denver  colorado under the terms of an operating lease  which expires in january yearly payments under the lease are approximately  net of sublease income 
the office lease in midland  texas represents a commitment of  per year through december and the office lease in calgary  alberta expires in august at a rate of  per year 
the remaining operating lease commitments represent equipment leases  which expire during through the company has entered into various firm transportation commitments for approximately mmcf of gross gas sales per day as of december  the majority of these contracts expire in and at december   the company had entered into an agreement with a third party to process its gas production from the white river dome coal bed methane project in the piceance basin 
under the terms of this agreement  the company is obligated to pay the third party  per month over the ten year term to cover the fixed operating costs of the plant and provide for a recovery of the plant investment to the third party 
the company is also obligated to reimburse the third party for certain variable expenses associated with the volumes processed through the plant and for compression made available to the company 
under certain circumstances  the company has the right but not the obligation to purchase the processing facility from the third party during the term of this agreement 
to assure the availability of a drilling rig in conjunction with an exploration program in west texas  the company entered into a two year commitment with a drilling contractor in the rig became available on march  after which a day period is allowed under the terms of this agreement to mobilize the rig and commence the two year drilling obligation 
under the terms of this arrangement  the company is required to pay a daywork rate of  day during drilling operations   day for rig moves and a special standby rate of  day during the initial day commencement period 
bank credit facility on june   the company entered into a new million credit facility the new credit facility that was to mature in june under the terms of the new credit facility  the borrowing base was established at million 
on march   as part of the final financing of the stellarton acquisition  the company repaid and cancelled its previous million revolving credit facility and entered into a new million credit facility the global credit facility 
the global credit facility is comprised of a million line of credit in the us and a million line of credit in canada which both mature in march  and a million five year term loan in canada 
the borrowing base under the global credit facility was set at million 
the global credit facility allows the lenders one scheduled redetermination of the borrowing base each december 
in addition  the lenders may elect to require one unscheduled redetermination in the event the borrowing base utilization exceeds of the borrowing base at any time for a period of consecutive business days 
at december   the company had borrowings outstanding under the global credit facility totaling million or of the borrowing base at an average interest rate of 
the amount available for borrowing under the global credit facility at december  was million 
borrowings under the global credit facility are unsecured and bear interest  at the election of the company  at a rate equal to i the greater of the global administrative agents prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus an applicable margin  ii adjusted libor for eurodollar loans plus applicable margin  or iii bankers acceptances plus applicable margin for canadian dollar loans 
interest on amounts outstanding under the global credit facility is due on the last day of each quarter for prime based loans  and in the case of eurodollar loans with an interest period of more than three months  interest is due at the end of each three month interval 
the global credit facility contains certain financial covenants and other restrictions similar to the limitations associated with the cancelled credit facility 
the financial covenants of the global credit facility require the company to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth of not less than million adjusted upward by of quarterly net income and of the net cash proceeds of any stock offering and the company will not permit its ratio of i indebtedness to ii earnings before interest expense  state and federal taxes and depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and exploration expense to be more than to as calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter 
the company was in compliance with all covenants during and at december  markets and prices the company s revenues and associated cash flows are significantly impacted by changes in gas and oil prices 
all of the company s gas and oil production is currently market sensitive as none of the company s gas and oil production has been presold at contractually specified prices 
during  the average prices received for gas and oil by the company were per mcf and per barrel  respectively  as compared to mcf and per barrel in and per mcf and per barrel in in december  the company believed that the pricing environment provided a strategic opportunity to significantly reduce the price risk on a portion of the company s production and decided to implement a hedging program 
accordingly  the company has entered into natural gas and crude oil futures contracts with counter parties to hedge the price risk associated with a portion of its production 
these derivatives are not held for trading purposes 
to the extent that changes occur in the market prices of natural gas and oil  the company is exposed to market risk on these open contracts 
this market risk exposure is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity hedged 
in december  the company entered into several costless collar arrangements put and call options to hedge approximately of the company s expected us gas production 
these positions were open as of january  when the company adopted sfas and sfas based upon the natural gas index pricing strip in effect as of january   the impact of these hedges at adoption resulted in a charge to other comprehensive loss of million net of the deferred tax benefit of million and the recognition of a derivative liability of million 
as of december   the company had no outstanding cash flow hedges 
the company received cash settlements of million in  which were recognized as increases in gas and oil sales 
the company also entered into natural gas basis swaps covering essentially the same time period of the natural gas costless collars 
these transactions were executed in december  with settlement periods in under sfas  these basis swaps did not qualify for hedge accounting 
accordingly  upon adoption of sfas  these basis swaps resulted in the recognition of derivative gains of million  recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of the deferred tax liability of million and a derivative asset of million 
a 
million gain was recognized in conjunction with the change in the value of these contracts in the year ended december  cash receipts of million were received during this period 
no basis swaps were outstanding at december  in august  the company entered into nymex based swaps for the september and october contract periods 
basis swaps were purchased on these quantities to correlate the volumes back to markets where the company actually delivers gas 
cash settlements of million were received on these contracts which increased gas and oil sales 
in october  the company entered into nymex based swaps for the november contract period 
basis swaps were purchased on these quantities to correlate the volumes back to markets where the company actually delivers gas 
a cash settlement of million was paid on the contracts which decreased gas and oil sales 
at december   there were no collars or other forms of hedging transactions in place 
forward looking statements and risk certain statements in this report  including statements of the future plans  objectives  and expected performance of the company  are forward looking statements that are dependent on certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside the company s control which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of these include  but are not limited to  economic and competitive conditions  inflation rates  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions  political and economic uncertainties  future business decisions  and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proven oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserves and production estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can affect these risks 
future oil and gas prices also could affect results of operations and cash flows 
donald l 
evans resignation effective january   donald l 
evans resigned as the company s chairman and chief executive officer to become the united states secretary of commerce 
mr 
evans received a retirement payment of million in cash 
in addition  the company accelerated the vesting of his outstanding stock options resulting in a non cash  pre tax charge to earnings of approximately million 
both the retirement payment and the non cash charge for the acceleration of the stock options were recognized by the company in the first quarter of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company utilizes various financial instruments which inherently have some degree of market risk 
the primary sources of market risk include fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rate fluctuations 
the company does not conduct its business through any special purpose entities or have any exposure to off balance sheet financing arrangements 
price fluctuations the company s results of operations are highly dependent upon the prices received for oil and natural gas production 
accordingly  in order to increase the financial flexibility and to protect the company against commodity price fluctuations  the company may  from time to time in the ordinary course of business  enter into non speculative hedge arrangements  commodity swap agreements  forward sale contracts  commodity futures  options and other similar agreements relating to natural gas and crude oil 
derivative financial instruments financial instruments designated as hedges are accounted for on the accrual basis with gains and losses being recognized based on the type of contract and exposure being hedged 
gains and losses on natural gas and crude oil swaps designated as hedges of anticipated transactions  including accrued gains or losses upon maturity or termination of the contract  are deferred and recognized in income when the associated hedged commodities are produced 
in order for natural gas and crude oil swaps to qualify as a hedge of an anticipated transaction  the derivative contract must identify the expected date of the transaction  the commodity involved  and the expected quantity to be purchased or sold among other requirements 
in the event that a hedged transaction does not occur  future gains and losses  including termination gains or losses  are included in the income statement when incurred 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
it also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
this pronouncement amended portions of sfas and was adopted by the company with sfas effective january  sfas  in part  allows special hedge accounting for cash flow hedges and provides that the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
interest rate risk at december   the company had million outstanding under the global credit facility at an average interest rate of 
borrowings under the global credit facility bear interest  at the election of the company  at i the greater of the global administrative agents prime rate or the federal funds effective rate  plus an applicable margin  ii adjusted libor for eurodollar loans plus applicable margin  or iii bankers acceptance plus applicable margin for canadian dollar loans 
as a result  the company s annual interest cost in will fluctuate based on short term interest rates 
assuming no change in the amount outstanding during  the impact on interest expense of a ten percent change in the average interest rate would be approximately 
million 
as the interest rate is variable and is reflective of current market conditions  the carrying value of the global credit facility approximates the fair value
