item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview baycorp derives all of its revenue through its energy trading activities and its equity interest in great bay and little bay 
great bay and little bay are electricity generating companies whose principal asset is a combined joint ownership interest in the seabrook nuclear power project in seabrook  new hampshire 
baycorp reported net income for the year ended december  and reported net losses for the years ended december    and the net income in was primarily attributable to increased revenues and the realized gain in on firm forward energy trading contracts 
the net loss was primarily attributable to the non cash charge to earnings for unrealized losses on firm forward trading contracts and the costs associated with a seabrook refueling outage during the final ten weeks of the net loss was primarily due to costs associated with the refueling outage during the fall of the net loss was primarily due to the costs associated with the unscheduled outages at the seabrook project that occurred during the year and to the charge related to the termination of a power marketing agreement between great bay and peco energy company 
the net loss was primarily due to costs associated with the scheduled and unscheduled outages at the seabrook project that occurred during that year 
the seabrook project from time to time experiences both scheduled and unscheduled outages 
baycorp incurs losses during outage periods due to the loss of all revenues from the sale of generation and additional costs associated with the outages as well as continuing operating and maintenance expenses and depreciation 
unscheduled outages or operation of the unit at reduced capacity can occur due to the automatic operation of safety systems following the detection of a malfunction 
in addition  it is possible for the unit to be shut down or operated at reduced capacity based on the results of scheduled and unscheduled inspections and routine surveillance by seabrook project personnel 
it is not possible for baycorp to predict the frequency or duration of any future unscheduled outages  however  it is likely that such unscheduled outages will occur 
refueling outages are generally scheduled every months depending upon the seabrook project capacity factor and the rate at which the nuclear fuel is consumed 
there was no refueling outage in the seabrook project conducted a refueling outage in  which began on october  this refueling outage was scheduled for approximately days  however due to unexpected mechanical problems  the seabrook project did not return to full power until february  the next refueling outage is scheduled to begin in may the following discussion focuses solely on operating revenues and operating expenses that are presented in a substantially consistent manner for all of the periods presented 
results of operations operating revenues baycorp s operating revenues for increased by approximately  or  to  as compared to  for the increase was attributable to several factors 
the capacity factor at the seabrook project was of the rated capacity for the twelve months ended december  as compared to a capacity factor of for the twelve months ended december  operating revenues and capacity factor were adversely impacted in and by the scheduled refueling outage at the seabrook project that began on october  a return to full power was expected on november  the outage was extended when damage to one of the plant s emergency diesel generators occurred  requiring an extensive repair effort 
the seabrook project returned to full power on february  the company purchased a significant amount of power to cover firm contracts  primarily due to this refueling outage  and also purchased power for resale in  thus increasing revenues 
purchased power expenses for the twelve months ended december  were approximately  as compared to approximately  for the twelve months ended december  primarily due to increased power purchases 
increases in capacity factor and purchased power increased sales of electricity by approximately to  kwhs in as compared to  kwhs in the company also realized a higher average selling price in during the twelve months ended december   the average selling price increased to cents per kwh as compared to an average selling price of cents per kwh for the twelve months ended december  great bay s cost of power determined by dividing total operating expenses by kwhs sold during the applicable period decreased to cents per kwh in as compared to cents per kwh in this decrease was primarily the result of increased kwhs sold in and lower operating expenses due to realized gains on firm forward contracts of approximately  in as compared to higher operating expenses in due to unrealized losses on firm forward contracts of approximately  in baycorp s operating revenues for increased by approximately  or  to  as compared to  for this increase was primarily attributable to increases in selling prices in as compared to during  the sales price kwh increased to cents per kwh as compared with cents per kwh in sales of electricity decreased slightly by approximately to  kwhs in as compared to  kwhs in the capacity factor at the seabrook project was of the rated capacity as compared to a capacity factor of for operating revenues and capacity factor were adversely impacted in by the scheduled refueling outage at the seabrook project that began on october  as mentioned above 
operating revenues and capacity factor were adversely impacted in by the scheduled refueling outage that began on march  great bay purchased approximately  kwhs for resale in primarily to cover firm contracts during the extended outage in the fourth quarter 
great bay s cost of power increased to cents per kwh in as compared to cents per kwh in this increase was primarily the result of the expense associated with the unrealized losses on firm forward contracts of approximately million in as compared to  in expenses baycorp s total operating expenses for decreased approximately  or  in comparison with this decrease was primarily the result of the non cash charge to earnings for unrealized gains losses on firm energy trading contracts 
in  the company realized gains on firm forward energy trading contracts of  and total operating expenses were reduced by this amount 
in  total operating expenses were higher because the company recorded unrealized losses on firm forward energy trading contracts of  as of december   the company held numerous firm forward energy trading contracts to deliver power in the company had no firm forward energy trading contracts as of december   nor does it expect to in  in light of its expected sale of its ownership interest in the seabrook project in late production and transmission costs decreased approximately  or  from  in to  in purchased power expenses increased approximately  or  from  in to  in this increase was primarily attributable to the extended duration of the refueling outage that began on october  a return to full power was expected on november  the outage was extended when damage to one of the plant s emergency diesel generators occurred  requiring an extensive repair effort 
the seabrook project returned to full power on february  in order to cover some of its firm energy contracts and to secure cash to cover some of its operating costs in the first half of  great bay executed a purchase power agreement with select in february whereby great bay sold mws of energy associated with seabrook to select in exchange for mws of energy associated with millstone unit and mws of energy associated with millstone unit the term of this agreement was april  through december  see business purchased power agreements 
administrative and general expenses increased approximately  or  from  in to  in this increase was primarily attributable to costs associated with employee turnover and retirements at the seabrook project in and a bad debt expense of  to establish a reserve for bad debts specific to enron 
see recent developments 
there was no similar charge in depreciation and amortization charges decreased approximately  or  from  in to  in this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in fixed asset values 
taxes other than income decreased  or  from  in to  in this decrease was due to the continued reduction in seabrook property taxes resulting from prior year negotiations between the management of the seabrook project and the towns of seabrook  hampton and hampton falls  new hampshire to reduce the assessed value of the seabrook project 
interest and dividend income decreased approximately  or  from  in to  in  primarily due to lower average monthly cash balances and lower interest rates in as compared although the company s cash balance at december  of  was approximately greater than its cash balance at december   the company s cash balance during the first half of was adversely affected by the late and early outage and was favorably affected by strong operations at seabrook during the second half of decommissioning cost accretion decreased  or  to  in as compared to  in this accretion is a non cash charge that reflects great bay s liability related to the closure and decommissioning of the seabrook project in current year dollars over the licensing period during which the seabrook project is licensed to operate 
decommissioning trust fund income decreased  or  to  in as compared to  in the decrease in interest earned on the decommissioning trust fund reflected the lower rates of returns on investments 
equity loss in baycorp s houstonstreet investment was  in as compared to  in as of december   the company owned of houstonstreet 
the company recognized its ownership share of houstonstreet s losses   for houstonstreet raised additional equity in from outside investors and as a result  as of december   the company s ownership fell below  to 
subsequently  the company deconsolidated houstonstreet as of december  and started accounting for this investment on the equity method 
the net financial impact of this deconsolidation was  recorded in baycorp invested  in houstonstreet in and recorded as an equity loss in investment 
other income deductions decreased approximately  to a net deduction in of  as compared to other income in of  this decrease in other income is primarily due to lower administrative fees charged to houstonstreet in as compared to and fewer sales of miscellaneous unit equipment at seabrook in as compared to baycorp s total operating expenses for increased million  or  in comparison with this increase was primarily the result of the non cash charge to earnings for unrealized losses on firm energy trading contracts 
unrealized losses for firm energy trading contracts were  for as compared to  for production costs increased approximately  or  from  in to  in this increase was primarily the result of the company s increased ownership in the seabrook project  from approximately for the first eleven months of to approximately for december and all of in addition  the increase in operating expenses in as compared to was attributable to the costs associated with the extended refueling outage in the fourth quarter of purchased power expenses increased approximately  or  from  in to  in this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the purchase price of power in as compared to administrative and general expenses increased approximately  or  from  in to  in depreciation and amortization increased approximately  or  from  in to  in these increases were primarily attributable to the increased ownership in the seabrook project in as compared to taxes other than income increased approximately  or  from  in to  in in addition to expenses increasing as a result of the company s increased ownership in the seabrook project  great bay also received a property tax refund in as settlement for changes in assessed property values 
interest and dividend income increased approximately  or  from  in to  in  primarily due to higher average cash balances during as compared to decommissioning cost accretion increased  or  to  in as compared to  in decommissioning trust fund income increased  or  to  in as compared to  in the increase in interest earned on the decommissioning trust fund reflected the higher fund balances as great bay continued to make contributions to the great bay decommissioning trust fund and the addition of the little bay decommissioning trust funds in other income increased approximately  or  to  in as compared to  in  primarily due to miscellaneous sales of unit equipment at seabrook 
equity loss in houstonstreet investment was  in and  in as of december   the company owned of houstonstreet 
the company recognized its ownership share of houstonstreet s losses   for houstonstreet raised additional equity in from outside investors and as a result  as of december   the company s ownership fell below  to 
subsequently  the company deconsolidated houstonstreet as of december  and started accounting for this investment on the equity method 
the net financial impact of this deconsolidation was  recorded in net operating losses for federal income tax purposes  as of december   the company had net operating loss carry forwards nols of approximately million  which are scheduled to expire between and because the company has experienced one or more ownership changes  within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  an annual limitation is imposed on the ability of the company to use million of these carryforwards 
the company s best estimate at this time is that the annual limitation on the use of million of the company s nols is approximately million per year 
any unused portion of the million annual limitation applicable to the company s restricted nol s is available for use in future years until such nol s are scheduled to expire 
the company s other million of nols are not currently subject to such limitations 
liquidity and capital resources baycorp s subsidiary  great bay  currently sells most of its power in the northeast united states short term wholesale power market 
the cash generated from electricity sales by great bay was sufficient to meet the company s ongoing cash requirements in if the seabrook project operates at a capacity factor below historical levels  or if expenses associated with the ownership or operation of the seabrook project  including without limitation decommissioning costs  are materially higher than anticipated  or if the prices at which great bay is able to sell its share of the seabrook project electricity decrease from current price levels  baycorp or great bay would be required to raise additional capital  either through a debt financing or an equity financing  to meet ongoing cash requirements 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance that baycorp or great bay will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms or at all 
on january   baycorp reported that great bay received notice on december  from enron that enron was terminating it contracts with great bay 
enron owes great bay  for power delivered prior to enron s chapter bankruptcy filing on december  great bay also had an administrative claim against enron of  for power delivered between december  and december  and an unliquidated claim for damages resulting from the termination of the contracts 
enron paid  to great bay on february  during the fourth quarter of  baycorp recorded an expense of  to establish a reserve for doubtful accounts due to the uncertainty of collecting remaining amounts owed by enron to great bay for power delivered prior to enron s chapter bankruptcy filing 
on february   great bay executed a purchase power agreement with select whereby great bay sold mws of energy associated with seabrook to select in exchange for mws of energy associated with millstone unit and mws of energy associated with millstone unit the term of this agreement was april  through december  delivery of power from either company was contingent on each of the units operating at certain capacity 
as part of the agreement  select made a prepayment of million to great bay in february and a second prepayment of million in march great bay compensated select for the prepayments by i paying annual interest for the period from february  through march  and ii giving select a price differential for the power being exchanged until such time as the select prepayment has been repaid 
in order to collateralize the transaction  great bay and little bay each provided select with a mortgage lien and security interest in their respective interests in the seabrook project 
great bay repaid select in and the mortgage liens and security interests were released as of july there was no price differential in exchanging power throughout the remaining term of the agreement 
the company s principal asset available to serve as collateral for borrowings is great bay s and little bay s combined interest in the seabrook project 
pursuant to a purchased power agreement  dated as of april   between great bay and unitil  great bay s interest in the seabrook project is encumbered by a mortgage 
this mortgage is subject and subordinate to up to million of senior secured financing and certain other mortgages 
baycorp s total cash and short term investments increased approximately  during the principal factor affecting liquidity during was the company s net income of  reduced by the non cash credit to income  realized gain on forward firm energy trading contracts  of approximately  other non cash charges to income included  for depreciation and amortization   for nuclear fuel amortization and  for decommissioning cost accretion 
in addition  there was an increase in miscellaneous liabilities of approximately  primarily due to the monthly accrual for outage costs estimated for the may refueling outage 
offsetting these non cash charges to income were cash charges including approximately  for decommissioning interest 
there was an approximate  increase in accounts receivable 
this increase was primarily due to higher sales in december as compared to december when there was a refueling outage at the seabrook project 
in addition  there was an approximate  decrease in accounts payable primarily due to higher accounts payable for purchased power in december as compared to december other cash charges included approximately  for capital expenditures and  for nuclear fuel 
great bay s decommissioning payments totaled approximately  the decommissioning funding schedule is determined by the ndfc  which reviews the schedule for the seabrook project at least annually 
great bay expects to use revenues from the sale of power to make decommissioning payments 
see business decommissioning 
baycorp received approximately  in from the exercise of options to purchase  shares of baycorp common stock by former employees of the company 
also in  baycorp invested  in cash in houstonstreet 
this amount was recorded as an equity loss in houstonstreet for and net income for was reduced by  great bay anticipates that its share of the seabrook project s capital expenditures for the fiscal year will total approximately million for nuclear fuel and various capital projects 
in addition  great bay is required under the joa to pay its share of seabrook unit and seabrook unit expenses  including  without limitation  operation and maintenance expenses  construction and nuclear fuel expenditures and decommissioning costs  regardless of the level of seabrook unit s operations 
in october  the company announced that it reached an agreement with northeast utilities nu under which the company s generating subsidiaries  great bay and little bay  will include their aggregate ownership share of the seabrook project in the current auction of nu s subsidiaries shares of the seabrook project 
under the terms of the agreement  baycorp will receive the sales price established by the auction process 
in the event that the sale yields proceeds for baycorp of more than million  baycorp and nu will share the excess proceeds 
should baycorp s sales proceeds be less than million  nu will make up the difference below that amount on a dollar for dollar basis up to a maximum of million 
under the agreement  baycorp will be paid separately for nuclear fuel and inventory 
the agreement also limits any top off amount required to be funded by baycorp for decommissioning as part of the sale process at the amount required by the nuclear regulatory commission nrc regulations 
the auction began in the last quarter of with a closing expected in the last quarter of certain factors that may affect future results this annual report contains forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  intends and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause the results of baycorp and or its subsidiaries to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  those set forth below and elsewhere in this report 
history of losses 
baycorp reported operating income for prior to  baycorp had never reported an operating profit for any year since its incorporation 
until  electricity sales at short term rates have not resulted in sufficient revenue to enable baycorp to meet its cash requirements for operations  maintenance and capital related costs 
in addition  and despite recently increasing prices for electricity in the northeast united states  there can be no assurance that great bay or little bay will be able to sell power at prices that will enable them to meet their cash requirements 
liquidity need 
as of december   baycorp had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments 
the company believes that such cash  together with the anticipated proceeds from the sale of electricity by great bay and little bay  will be sufficient to enable the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries to meet their cash requirements in however  if in  the seabrook project operates at a capacity factor below historical levels  or if expenses associated with the ownership or operation of the seabrook project  including without limitation decommissioning costs  costs associated with the may scheduled refueling outage and costs associated with the sale of the seabrook project  are materially higher than anticipated  or if the prices at which great bay and little bay are able to sell their share of the seabrook project electricity decrease from current price levels  the company or its wholly owned subsidiaries would be required to raise additional capital  either through a debt financing or an equity financing  to meet ongoing cash requirements 
in that event  the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries would likely need to raise additional capital from outside sources 
there is no assurance that the company or its subsidiaries would be able to raise such capital or that the terms on which any additional capital is available would be acceptable 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  dilution to then existing stockholders will result 
primary reliance on a single asset 
baycorp s principal source of revenue is its wholesale electricity generation and trading business  which depends in large part on great bay and little bay s combined joint interest in the seabrook nuclear power project in seabrook  new hampshire 
accordingly  baycorp s results of operations significantly depend on the successful and continued operation of the seabrook project 
in particular  if the seabrook project experiences unscheduled outages of significant duration  baycorp s results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
risks associated with agreement to sell seabrook ownership interests 
on october   the company  great bay and little bay entered into an agreement with northeast utilities nu under which great bay and little bay will join with nu in the sale of nu s ownership interests in the seabrook project 
under the terms of the agreement  baycorp will receive the sales price established by an auction process led by nu 
although the auction process began in the last quarter of with a closing expected in the last quarter of  the company cannot control the procedure or timing of the joint sale of the seabrook project  and the sale may be delayed  abandoned or otherwise affected by factors beyond the company s control 
significantly  the price obtained by great bay and little bay in the sale of their seabrook interests cannot be predicted 
further  the value of the fuel and inventory owned by great bay and little bay  currently estimated at between million to million  may be materially different than estimated 
changes in the new england wholesale power market 
during recent years in new england  the combination of small increases in the demand for electricity and electric industry deregulation has resulted in increased uncertainty regarding the price of electricity in the wholesale power market 
although great bay s average selling price per kwh determined by dividing total sales revenue by the total number of kwhs sold in the applicable period increased from cents in to cents in and to cents in  there can be no assurance that great bay or little bay will be able to sell their power at these prices or higher prices in the future 
risks in connection with joint ownership of seabrook project 
great bay and little bay are required under the joa to pay their share of seabrook unit and seabrook unit expenses  including without limitation operations and maintenance expenses  construction and nuclear fuel expenditures and decommissioning costs  regardless of seabrook unit s operations 
under certain circumstances  a failure by great bay or little bay to make their monthly payments under the joa entitles certain other joint owners of the seabrook project to purchase great bay or little bay s interest in the seabrook project for of the then fair market value thereof 
in addition  the failure to make monthly payments under the joa by owners of the seabrook project other than great bay and little bay may have a material adverse effect on the company 
for example  great bay or little bay could opt to pay a greater proportion of the seabrook project expenses in order to preserve the value of their share of the seabrook project 
in the past  certain of the owners of the seabrook project other than great bay and little bay have not made their full respective payments 
the electric utility industry is undergoing significant changes as competition and deregulation are introduced into the marketplace 
if a participant other than great bay or little bay filed for bankruptcy and that participant was unable to pay its share of seabrook project expenses  great bay or little bay might opt to pay a greater portion of seabrook project expenses in order to preserve the value of their share of the seabrook project 
in the past  the filing of bankruptcy by a participant has not resulted in a failure to pay seabrook project expenses or an increase in the percentage of expenses paid by other participants 
the seabrook project is owned by great bay  little bay and the other owners thereof as tenants in common  with the various owners holding varying ownership shares 
this means that great bay and little bay  which together own only a interest  do not have control of the management of the seabrook project 
as a result  decisions may be made affecting the seabrook project notwithstanding great bay and or little bay s opposition 
certain costs and expenses of operating the seabrook project or owning an interest therein  such as certain insurance and decommissioning costs  are subject to increase or retroactive adjustment based on factors beyond the control of baycorp or its subsidiaries 
the cost of disposing of unit of the seabrook project is not known at this time 
these various costs and expenses may adversely affect baycorp  great bay and little bay  possibly materially 
extensive government regulation 
the seabrook project is subject to extensive regulation by federal and state agencies 
in particular  the seabrook project  and great bay and little bay as part owners of a licensed nuclear facility  are subject to the broad jurisdiction of the nrc  which is empowered to authorize the siting  construction and operation of nuclear reactors after consideration of public health and safety  environmental and antitrust matters 
great bay and little bay are also subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc and  as a result  are required to file with ferc all contracts for the sale of electricity 
ferc s jurisdiction also includes  among other things  the sale  lease  merger  consolidation or other disposition of facilities  interconnection of certain facilities  accounts  service and property records 
noncompliance with nrc requirements may result  among other things  in a shutdown of the seabrook project 
the nrc has promulgated a broad range of regulations affecting all aspects of the design  construction and operation of a nuclear facility  such as the seabrook project  including performance of nuclear safety systems  fire protection  emergency response planning and notification systems  insurance and quality assurance 
the nrc retains authority to modify  suspend or withdraw operating licenses  such as the license pursuant to which the seabrook project operates  at any time that conditions warrant 
for example  the nrc might order seabrook unit shut down i if flaws were discovered in the construction or operation of seabrook unit  ii if problems developed with respect to other nuclear generating plants of a design and construction similar to unit  iii if accidents at other nuclear facilities suggested that nuclear generating plants generally were less safe than previously believed or iv if security measures activated immediately after the attacks of september   or as a result of the nrc s safety order on february   were deemed insufficient or inadequate 
risk of nuclear accident 
nuclear reactors have been used to generate electric power for more than years and there are currently nuclear reactors operating for electric power generation in the united states 
although the safety record of these nuclear reactors in the united states generally has been very good  accidents and other unforeseen problems have occurred both in the united states and elsewhere  including the well publicized incidents at three mile island in pennsylvania and chernobyl in the former soviet union 
the consequences of such an accident can be severe  including loss of life and property damage  and the available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay all the damages incurred 
risk of terrorist attack 
with continued uncertainty about the possibility of additional terrorist activities in the united states  the nation s nuclear power plants  including the seabrook project  remain at a high level of security 
on february   the nrc issued an order to all nuclear plant licensees  requiring them to take certain additional interim compensatory measures to address the generalized high level threat environment 
these additional compensatory requirements will provide the nrc with reasonable assurance that public health and safety and the common defense and security continue to be adequately protected in the current generalized high level threat environment 
these requirements will remain in effect pending notification from the nrc that a significant change in the threat environment occurs  or until the nrc determines that other changes are needed following a more comprehensive reevaluation of current safeguards and security programs 
compliance with these requirements will result in additional incremental operating and capital costs 
should additional security measures be required by the nrc  additional operating or capital costs could be incurred at the seabrook project 
these costs could be substantial 
the consequences of a terrorist attack could be severe  including loss of life and property damage  and the available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay all the damages incurred 
waste disposal  decommissioning cost 
there has been considerable public concern and regulatory attention focused upon the disposal of low and high level nuclear wastes produced at nuclear facilities and the ultimate decommissioning of such facilities 
as to waste disposal concerns  both the federal government and the state of new hampshire are currently delinquent in the performance of their statutory obligations 
the joint owners of the seabrook project  through their managing agent naesco  entered into contracts with the doe for high level waste disposal in accordance with the nwpa 
under these contracts and the nwpa  the doe was required to take title to and dispose of the seabrook project s high level waste beginning no later than january  the doe has not met its contractual and statutory requirements under the nwpa calling for the doe to begin accepting spent fuel from the industry by january the doe announced that its first high level waste repository would not be in operation until at the earliest 
the seabrook project increased its on site storage capacity for low level waste llw in and that capacity is expected to be sufficient to meet the project s storage requirements through in addition  the managing agent of the seabrook project has advised the joint owners that the seabrook project has adequate on site storage capacity for high level waste until approximately if the seabrook project were unable to store nuclear waste on site or make other disposal provisions  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
see business nuclear waste disposal 
as to decommissioning  nrc regulations require that upon permanent shutdown of a nuclear facility  appropriate arrangements for full decontamination and decommissioning of the facility be made 
these regulations require that during the operation of a facility  the owners of the facility must set aside sufficient funds to defray decommissioning costs 
while the owners of the seabrook project are accumulating monies in a trust fund to defray decommissioning costs  these costs could substantially exceed the value of the trust fund  and the owners including great bay and little bay would remain liable for the excess 
moreover  the amount that is required to be deposited in the trust fund is subject to periodic review and adjustment by an independent commission of the state of new hampshire  which could result in material increases in such amounts 
risks related to houstonstreet 
houstonstreet s revenues depend on continued and expanded use of internet based wholesale energy trading platforms 
electronic trading of wholesale energy is new and evolving  and thus may not achieve widespread market acceptance or emerge as a sustainable business 
in addition  houstonstreet will need to enhance trading liquidity in order to increase and sustain revenues 
as a technology dependent business  houstonstreet s business could suffer due to computer or communications systems interruptions or failures  technological change or adverse competitive developments 
further  as electronic commerce evolves  federal  state and foreign agencies could adopt regulations covering issues such as user privacy  content and taxation of products and services 
if enacted  government regulations could materially adversely affect houstonstreet s business 
although houstonstreet currently is not aware that it infringes any other patents  it is possible that houstonstreet s technology infringes patents held by third parties 
if houstonstreet were to be found infringing  the owner of the patent could sue houstonstreet for damages  prevent houstonstreet from making  selling or using the owner s patented technology or could impose substantial royalty fees for those privileges 
if any of the foregoing risks materialize  or other risks develop that adversely affect houstonstreet  or if houstonstreet fails to grow its revenues and net income  baycorp could lose all of the value of its investment in houstonstreet 
critical accounting policies preparation of the company s financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses 
note to the consolidated financial statements is a summary of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
the following is a discussion of the most critical accounting policies used by the company 
decommissioning based on the financial accounting standards board s fasb tentative conclusions  reflected on the february   exposure draft titled accounting for certain liabilities related to closure and removal of long lived assets great bay and little bay have recognized as a liability their proportionate share of the present value of the estimated cost of seabrook project decommissioning 
for great bay  the initial recognition of this liability was capitalized as part of the fair value of the utility plant at november  for little bay  the amount was provided for in the purchase price allocation 
new hampshire enacted a law in requiring the creation of a state managed fund to finance decommissioning of any nuclear units in the state 
the seabrook project s decommissioning estimate and funding schedule is subject to review each year by the new hampshire nuclear decommissioning financing committee ndfc 
this estimate is based on a number of assumptions 
changes in assumptions for such things as labor and material costs  technology  inflation and timing of decommissioning could cause these estimates to change  possibly materially  in the near term 
during november  the ndfc issued an order which established a decommissioning funding schedule in anticipation of the sale of a majority of the ownership interests in seabrook 
the ndfc set an accelerated funding schedule for the years through for the years and beyond  the funding schedule assumes contributions will be made until the order also established the requirement for a lump sum top off payment at closing 
the current estimated cost to decommission the seabrook project based on ndfc docket is approximately million in dollars  assuming for decommissioning funding purposes  a remaining year life for the facility and a future cost escalation of 
great bay and little bay  based on the initial exposure draft  have been recognizing a liability based on the present value of the estimated future cash outflows required to satisfy their obligations using a risk free rate 
as of december   the estimated undiscounted cash outflows for great bay and little bay  for decommissioning  based on the november ndfc study  with decommissioning expenditures starting in and being completed in  was million  which discounted at an average rate of  over the funding period  to december   represented a liability of million reflected in the accompanying balance sheet 
as of december   and based on the prior ndfc study  the estimated undiscounted cash outflows for great bay and little bay  for decommissioning expenditures  starting in and being completed in was million  which discounted at an average rate of  over the funding schedule to december  represented a liability of million reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
in accordance with the original exposure draft  the company s wholly owned subsidiaries record any adjustments to the decommissioning liability due to changes in estimates in the utility plant account 
great bay and little bay accrete their share of the seabrook project s decommissioning liability 
this accretion is a non cash charge and recognizes their liability related to the closure and decommissioning of their nuclear plant in current year dollars over the licensing period of the plant 
the non cash accretion charge recorded in the accompanied consolidated statements of income was   and  for the years ended december   and the change in the accretion between years reflects adjustments to the estimated decommissioning by the ndfc 
funds collected by seabrook for decommissioning are deposited in an external irrevocable trust pending their ultimate use 
the earnings on the external trusts also accumulate in the fund balance 
the trust funds are restricted for use in paying the decommissioning of unit the investments in the trust are available for sale 
great bay and little bay have therefore reported their investment in trust fund assets at market value and any unrealized gains and losses are reflected in equity 
there was an unrealized holding gain of  and  as of december  and although the owners of seabrook are accumulating funds in an external trust to defray decommissioning costs  these costs could substantially exceed the value of the trust fund  and the owners  including great bay and little bay  would remain liable for the excess 
on november   great bay  the bondholder s committee and the predecessor s former parent  eastern utilities eua entered into a settlement agreement that resolved certain proceedings against eua brought by the bondholder s committee 
under the settlement agreement eua reaffirmed its guarantee of up to million of great bay s future decommissioning costs of seabrook unit seabrook outage costs the company s operating results and the comparability of these results on an interim and annual basis are directly impacted by the operations of the seabrook project  including the cyclical refueling outages generally months apart as well as unscheduled outages 
during outage periods at the seabrook project  great bay and little bay have no electricity for resale from the seabrook project and consequently no related revenues 
therefore the impact of outages on the company s and great bay s and little bay s results of operations and financial position are materially adverse 
great bay and little bay accrue for the incremental costs of the seabrook project s scheduled outages over the periods between those outages 
however  great bay and little bay continue to expense the normal seabrook operating and maintenance expenses as incurred 
therefore  the company will incur losses during scheduled outage periods as a result of the combination of the lack of revenue and the recognition of normal recurring operation and maintenance costs as well as the continuing depreciation of the utility plant 
at the seabrook project  a scheduled refueling outage began on october  seabrook resumed full operating capacity on february  seabrook project management have scheduled the next outage to begin in may the outage has an estimated incremental operations and maintenance cost of million 
the company s share is approximately million 
the estimate is based on a number of assumptions 
changes in assumptions for such things as labor and contractor costs  required repairs and days to perform the outage and plant operations in the interim  could cause this estimate to change

in response to these questions  the fasb agreed to review the accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs 
on february  the fasb issued a revision of exposure draft issued february   proposed statement of financial accounting standards accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
on june   the respective proposed statement was issued by the fasb 
in august  the fasb approved the issuance of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for retirement obligations 
sfas no 
provides accounting requirements for the recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with the retirement of long lived assets and requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
great bay s and little bay s accounting for decommissioning is based on the fasb s original tentative conclusions 
the new statement requires that an obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset be recognized as a liability when incurred  and that the amount of the liability resulting from a the passage of time and b revisions to either the timing or amount of estimated cash flows should also be recognized 
the new statement also requires that  upon initial recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation  an entity capitalize that cost by recognizing an increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the new statement requires the initial measurement of the liability to be based on fair value  where the fair value is the amount that an entity would be required to pay in an active market to settle the asset retirement obligation in a current transaction in circumstances other than a forced liquidation or settlement 
because in most circumstances  a market for settling asset retirement obligations does not exist  the fasb described an expected present value technique for estimating fair value 
if the new statement is adopted  great bay s and little bay s decommissioning liability and annual provision for decommissioning accretion could change relative to the new statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier adoption encouraged 
great bay and little bay have not quantified the impact  if any  that the new statement will have on the consolidated financial statements 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
although sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 it retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
regarding recognition measurement of impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
under sfas no 
 asset write downs from discontinuing a business segment will be treated the same as other assets held for sale 
the new standard also broadens the financial statement presentation of discontinued operations to include the disposal of an asset group rather than a segment of a business 
sfas no 
is effective beginning january  and  generally  is to be applied prospectively 
the company does not expect that sfas no 
will have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations
