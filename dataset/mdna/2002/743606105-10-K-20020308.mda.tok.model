interest rate fluctuations  as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and liabilities  combine to affect net interest income 
the company s net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as a volume change 
it is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing deposits and other borrowed funds  referred to as a rate change

goodwill amortization in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  sfas no 
and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
sfas no 
specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
and subsequently  sfas no 
after its adoption 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as of july   and sfas no 
was effective january  goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june   but before sfas no 
is adopted in full  are not amortized 
as of the date of adoption of sfas no 
 the company expects to have unamortized goodwill in the amount of million and no unamortized identifiable intangible assets  all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas no 
amortization expense related to goodwill was million and million for years ended december  and  respectively 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas no 
 it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting the statement on the company s financial statements at the date of this report  including whether the company will be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
impact of inflation the effects of inflation on the local economy and on the company s operating results have been relatively modest for the past several years 
since substantially all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  such as cash  securities  loans and deposits  their values are less sensitive to the effects of inflation than to changing interest rates  which do not necessarily change in accordance with inflation rates 
the company tries to control the impact of interest rate fluctuations by managing the relationship between its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities

financial condition loan portfolio at december   total loans were million  an increase of million or from million at december  at december   total loans were of deposits and of total assets 
at december   total loans were of deposits and of total assets 
loans increased during from million at december  to million at december  the loan growth during was due to strong loan demand and the south texas acquisition 
the following table summarizes the company s loan portfolio by type of loan as of the dates indicated december  amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands commercial and industrial    real estate construction and land development    family residential    home equity    commercial mortgages    farmland    multifamily residential    agriculture    other   consumer    total loans    december  amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands commercial and industrial   real estate construction and land development   family residential   home equity  na na commercial mortgages   farmland   multifamily residential   agriculture   other  consumer   total loans   the lending focus of the company is on family residential loans and small and medium sized business loans 
the company offers a variety of commercial lending products including term loans and lines of credit 
the company also offers a broad range of short to medium term commercial loans  primarily collateralized  to businesses for working capital including inventory and receivables  business expansion including acquisitions of real estate and improvements and the purchase of equipment and machinery 
historically  the company has originated loans for its own account and has not securitized its loans 
the purpose of a particular loan generally determines its structure 
all loans in the family residential category were originated by the company 
loans from  to million are evaluated and acted upon by an officers loan committee  which meets weekly 
loans above that amount must be approved by the directors loan committee  which meets monthly 
in nearly all cases  the company s commercial loans are made in the company s primary market area and are underwritten on the basis of the borrower s ability to service such debt from income 
as a general practice  the company takes as collateral a lien on any available real estate  equipment or other assets owned by the borrower and obtains a personal guaranty of the borrower 
working capital loans are primarily collateralized by short term assets whereas term loans are primarily collateralized by long term assets 
as a result  commercial loans involve additional complexities  variables and risks and require more thorough underwriting and servicing than other types of loans 
the company s commercial mortgage loans are secured by first liens on real estate  typically have variable interest rates and amortize over a ten to year period 
payments on loans secured by such properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties 
accordingly  repayment of these loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy to a greater extent than other types of loans 
the company seeks to minimize these risks in a variety of ways  including giving careful consideration to the property s operating history  future operating projections  current and projected occupancy  location and physical condition in connection with underwriting these loans 
the underwriting analysis also includes credit verification  appraisals and a review of the financial condition of the borrower 
additionally  a significant portion of the company s lending activity has consisted of the origination of family residential mortgage loans collateralized by owner occupied properties located in the company s market areas 
the company offers a variety of mortgage loan products which generally are amortized over five to years 
loans collateralized by family residential real estate generally have been originated in amounts of no more than of appraised value or have mortgage insurance 
the company requires mortgage title insurance and hazard insurance 
the company has elected to keep all family residential loans for its own account rather than selling such loans into the secondary market 
by doing so  the company is able to realize a higher yield on these loans  however  the company also incurs interest rate risk as well as the risks associated with nonpayments on such loans 
the company makes loans to finance the construction of residential and  to a limited extent  nonresidential properties 
construction loans generally are secured by first liens on real estate and have floating interest rates 
the company conducts periodic inspections  either directly or through an agent  prior to approval of periodic draws on these loans 
underwriting guidelines similar to those described above are also used in the company s construction lending activities 
construction loans involve additional risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of a project under construction  and the project is of uncertain value prior to its completion 
because of uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs  the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property  it can be difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value ratio 
as a result of these uncertainties  construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent  in part  on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan 
if the company is forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion  there is no assurance that the company will be able to recover all of the unpaid portion of the loan 
in addition  the company may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate period of time 
while the company has underwriting procedures designed to identify what it believes to be acceptable levels of risks in construction lending  no assurance can be given that these procedures will prevent losses from the risks described above 
consumer loans made by the company include direct a credit automobile loans  recreational vehicle loans  boat loans  home improvement loans  home equity loans  personal loans collateralized and uncollateralized and deposit account collateralized loans 
the terms of these loans typically range from to months and vary based upon the nature of collateral and size of loan 
consumer loans entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans  particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles 
in such cases  any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan balance 
the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment 
in addition  consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans 
the company provides agricultural loans for short term crop production  including rice  cotton  milo and corn  farm equipment financing and agricultural real estate financing 
the company evaluates agricultural borrowers primarily based on their historical profitability  level of experience in their particular agricultural industry  overall financial capacity and the availability of secondary collateral to withstand economic and natural variations common to the industry 
because agricultural loans present a higher level of risk associated with events caused by nature  the company routinely makes on site visits and inspections in order to monitor and identify such risks 
the contractual maturity ranges of the commercial and industrial and construction and land development portfolios and the amount of such loans with predetermined interest rates and floating rates in each maturity range as of december  are summarized in the following table december  after one one year through after five or less five years years total dollars in thousands commercial and industrial     construction and land development   total     loans with a predetermined interest rate     loans with a floating interest rate     total     nonperforming assets the company has several procedures in place to assist it in maintaining the overall quality of its loan portfolio 
the company has established underwriting guidelines to be followed by its officers 
the company also monitors its delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s loan portfolio will not become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions 
the company requires appraisals on loans secured by real estate 
with respect to potential problem loans  an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition is made to determine the need  if any  for possible write downs or appropriate additions to the allowance for credit losses 
the company generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases accruing interest when the payment of principal or interest is delinquent for days  or earlier in some cases  unless the loan is in the process of collection and the underlying collateral fully supports the carrying value of the loan 
the company generally charges off such loans before attaining nonaccrual status 
the company s conservative lending approach has resulted in strong asset quality 
the company had  in nonperforming assets as of december  compared with million at december  and the following table presents information regarding nonperforming assets at the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans  restructured loans accruing loans or more days past due other real estate total nonperforming assets    nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate allowance for credit losses the following table presents for the periods indicated an analysis of the allowance for credit losses and other related data years ended december  dollars in thousands average loans outstanding      gross loans outstanding at end of period      allowance for credit losses at beginning of period      balance acquired with the compass  south texas and union acquisitions  respectively provision for credit losses charge offs commercial and industrial real estate and agriculture consumer recoveries commercial and industrial real estate and agriculture consumer net charge offs recoveries allowance for credit losses at end of period

nonperforming loans totaled  at december  the allowance for credit losses is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses 
management has established an allowance for credit losses which it believes is adequate for estimated losses in the company s loan portfolio 
based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio  management presents a monthly review of the allowance for credit losses to the bank s board of directors  indicating any change in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance 
in making its evaluation  management considers factors such as historical loan loss experience  industry diversification of the company s commercial loan portfolio  the amount of nonperforming assets and related collateral  the volume  growth and composition of the company s loan portfolio  current economic changes that may affect the borrower s ability to pay and the value of collateral  the evaluation of the company s loan portfolio through its internal loan review process and other relevant factors 
charge offs occur when loans are deemed to be uncollectable 
the company considers risk elements attributable to particular loan types or categories in assessing the quality of individual loans 
some of the risk elements include 
for family residential mortgage loans  the borrower s ability to repay the loan  including a consideration of the debt to income ratio and employment and income stability  the loan to value ratio  and the age  condition and marketability of collateral  
for commercial mortgage loans and multifamily residential loans  the debt service coverage ratio income from the property in excess of operating expenses compared to loan payment requirements  operating results of the owner in the case of owner occupied properties  the loan to value ratio  the age and condition of the collateral and the volatility of income  property value and future operating results typical of properties of that type  
for agricultural real estate loans  the experience and financial capability of the borrower  projected debt service coverage of the operations of the borrower and loan to value ratio  
for construction and land development loans  the perceived feasibility of the project including the ability to sell developed lots or improvements constructed for resale or ability to lease property constructed for lease  the quality and nature of contracts for presale or preleasing  if any  experience and ability of the developer and loan to value ratio  
for commercial and industrial loans  the operating results of the commercial  industrial or professional enterprise  the borrower s business  professional and financial ability and expertise  the specific risks and volatility of income and operating results typical for businesses in that category and the value  nature and marketability of collateral  and 
for non real estate agricultural loans  the operating results  experience and financial capability of the borrower  historical and expected market conditions and the value  nature and marketability of collateral 
in addition  for each category  the company considers secondary sources of income and the financial strength and credit history of the borrower and any guarantors 
the company follows a loan review program to evaluate the credit risk in the loan portfolio 
through the loan review process  the company maintains an internally classified loan list which  along with the delinquency list of loans  helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
loans classified as substandard are those loans with clear and defined weaknesses such as a highly leveraged position  unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition  which may jeopardize recoverability of the debt 
loans classified as doubtful are those loans which have characteristics similar to substandard accounts but with an increased risk that a loss may occur  or at least a portion of the loan may require a charge off if liquidated at present 
loans classified as loss are those loans which are in the process of being charged off 
for each classified loan  the company generally allocates a specific loan loss reserve equal to a predetermined percentage of the loan amount  depending on the classification 
in addition to the internally classified loan list and delinquency list of loans  the company maintains a separate watch list which further aids the company in monitoring loan portfolios 
watch list loans have one or more deficiencies that require attention in the short term or pertinent ratios of the loan account that have weakened to a point where more frequent monitoring is warranted 
these loans do not have all of the characteristics of a classified loan substandard or doubtful but do show weakened elements compared with those of a satisfactory credit 
the company reviews these loans to assist in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
in order to determine the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses  management considers the risk classification or delinquency status of loans and other factors  such as collateral value  portfolio composition  trends in economic conditions and the financial strength of borrowers 
management establishes specific allowances for loans which management believes require reserves greater than those allocated according to their classification or delinquent status 
an unallocated allowance is also established based on the company s historical charge off experience and existing general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the company  credit quality trends  collateral values  loan volume and concentrations and seasoning of the loan portfolio 
the company then charges to operations a provision for credit losses to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an adequate level determined by the foregoing methodology 
for the year ended december   net charge offs totaled  or of average loans outstanding for the period  compared with net recoveries of  or of average loans during the company s net recoveries totaled  or of average loans outstanding in during  the company recorded a provision for credit losses of  compared with  for at december   the allowance for credit losses totaled million  or of total loans 
the company made a provision for credit losses of  during compared with a provision of  for at december   the allowance aggregated million  or of total loans 
at december   the allowance was million  or of total loans 
the following tables describe the allocation of the allowance for credit losses among various categories of loans and certain other information for the dates indicated 
the allocation is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the categories in which future losses may occur

federal and state bank regulators also require that a bank maintain a reserve that is sufficient to absorb an estimated amount of unidentified potential losses based on management s perception of economic conditions  loan portfolio growth  historical charge off experience and exposure concentrations 
management  along with a number of economists  has perceived during the past year an increasing instability in the national and southeast texas economies and a worldwide economic slowdown that could contribute to job losses and otherwise adversely affect a broad variety of business sectors 
in addition  as the company has grown  its aggregate loan portfolio has increased and since the company has made a decision to diversify its loan portfolio into areas other than family residential mortgage loans  the risk profile of the company s loans has increased 
by virtue of its increased capital levels  the company is able to make larger loans  thereby increasing the possibility of one bad loan having a larger adverse impact than before 
the company believes that the allowance for credit losses at december  is adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio as of such date 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not sustain losses in future periods  which could be substantial in relation to the size of the allowance at december  securities the company uses its securities portfolio both as a source of income and as a source of liquidity 
at december   investment securities totaled million  an increase of million or from million at december   primarily due to the company investing excess deposits

these securities are deemed to have high credit ratings  and minimum regular monthly cash flows of principal and interest are guaranteed by the issuing agencies 
however  unlike us treasury and us government agency securities  which have a lump sum payment at maturity  mortgage backed securities provide cash flows from regular principal and interest payments and principal prepayments throughout the lives of the securities 
mortgage backed securities which are purchased at a premium will generally suffer decreasing net yields as interest rates drop because home owners tend to refinance their mortgages 
thus  the premium paid must be amortized over a shorter period 
therefore  these securities purchased at a discount will obtain higher net yields in a decreasing interest rate environment 
as interest rates rise  the opposite will generally be true 
during a period of increasing interest rates  fixed rate mortgage backed securities do not tend to experience heavy prepayments of principal and consequently  the average life of this security will not be unduly shortened 
if interest rates begin to fall  prepayments will increase 
at december   of the mortgage backed securities held by the company had contractual final maturities of more than ten years with a weighted average life of years 
collateralized mortgage obligations cmos are bonds that are backed by pools of mortgages 
the pools can be gnma  fnma or fhlmc pools or they can be private label pools 
the cmos are designed so that the mortgage collateral will generate a cash flow sufficient to provide for the timely repayment of the bonds 
the mortgage collateral pool can be structured to accommodate various desired bond repayment schedules  provided that the collateral cash flow is adequate to meet scheduled bond payments 
this is accomplished by dividing the bonds into classes to which payments on the underlying mortgage pools are allocated in different order 
the bond s cash flow  for example can be dedicated to one class of bondholders at a time  thereby increasing call protection to bondholders 
in private label cmos  losses on underlying mortgages are directed to the most junior of all classes and then to the classes above in order of increasing seniority  which means that the senior classes have enough credit protection to be given the highest credit rating by the rating agencies 
at the date of purchase  the company is required to classify debt and equity securities into one of three categories held to maturity  trading or available for sale 
at each reporting date  the appropriateness of the classification is reassessed 
investments in debt securities are classified as held to maturity and measured at amortized cost in the financial statements only if management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity 
securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
investments not classified as either held to maturity or trading are classified as available for sale and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses reported  net of tax  in a separate component of shareholders equity until realized 
deposits the company offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms 
the company s deposits consist of demand  savings  money market and time accounts 
the company relies primarily on competitive pricing policies and customer service to attract and retain these deposits 
the company does not have or accept any brokered deposits 
total deposits at december  were billion  an increase of million or from billion at december  the increase is primarily attributable to internal growth 
noninterest bearing deposits of million at december  increased  or from million at december  noninterest bearing deposits at december  were million compared with million at december  interest bearing deposits at december  were million  up million or from million at december  interest bearing deposits at december  of million represented a million or increase from million at december  total deposits at december  were million

occasionally  the company obtains additional funds from the federal home loan bank fhlb and correspondent banks 
at december   the company had million in fhlb borrowings of which million consisted of fhlb notes payable 
the highest outstanding balance of fhlb advances during was million 
at december   the company had million in fhlb notes payable compared with million at december  at december   the company had no federal funds purchased 
the company had no federal funds purchased at december  compared with million in federal funds purchased at december  at december    and  the company had no outstanding borrowings under a revolving line of credit extended by a commercial bank 
in november  the company formed a wholly owned statutory business trust  prosperity capital trust i trust i  which issued million in trust preferred securities  and in july  the company formed a second wholly owned statutory business trust  prosperity statutory trust ii trust ii  which issued million in trust preferred securities on july  trust i and trust ii invested the proceeds in an equivalent amount of the company s junior subordinated debentures bearing an interest rate equal to the distribution rate on the respective issue of trust preferred securities 
the debentures issued to trust i will mature on november   which date may be shortened to a date not earlier than november  if certain conditions are met  including prior approval of the federal reserve board 
the debentures issued to trust ii will mature on july   which date may be shortened to a date not earlier than july   if certain conditions are met  including prior approval of the federal reserve board 
these debentures  which are the only assets of each trust  are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all present and future senior indebtedness as defined in the respective indentures of the company 
the company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed each trust s obligations under the trust preferred securities 
the debentures issued to trust i accrue interest at an annual rate of of the aggregate liquidation amount  payable quarterly 
the debentures issued to trust ii accrue interest at a floating rate equal to month libor plus of the aggregate liquidation amount  not to exceed  payable quarterly 
the annual interest rate on the debentures issued to trust ii for the period from october  through december  was equal to 
the quarterly distributions on each issuance of trust preferred securities are paid at the same rate that interest is paid on the corresponding debentures 
under the provisions of each issue of the debentures  the company has the right to defer payment of interest on the debentures at any time  or from time to time  for periods not exceeding five years 
if interest payments on either issue of the debentures are deferred  the distributions on the respective trust preferred securities will also be deferred 
for financial reporting purposes  trust i and trust ii are treated as subsidiaries of the company and consolidated in the corporate financial statements 
the trust preferred securities are presented as a separate category of long term debt on the balance sheet 
although the trust preferred securities are not included as a component of shareholders equity on the balance sheet  for regulatory purposes  the trust preferred securities are treated as tier capital by the federal reserve 
the treatment of the trust preferred securities as tier capital  in addition to the ability to deduct the expense of the debentures for federal income tax purposes  provided the company with a cost effective method of raising capital 
interest rate sensitivity and market risk the company s asset liability and funds management policy provides management with the necessary guidelines for effective funds management  and the company has established a measurement system for monitoring its net interest rate sensitivity position 
the company manages its sensitivity position within established guidelines 
as a financial institution  the company s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of the company s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those which have a short term to maturity 
based upon the nature of the company s operations  the company is not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk 
the company does not own any trading assets 
interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes 
these economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and or a loss of current fair market values 
the objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income 
management realizes certain risks are inherent  and that the goal is to identify and accept the risks 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the asset liability committee alco  which is composed of senior officers of the company  in accordance with policies approved by the company s board of directors 
the alco formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk 
in determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk  the alco considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook on interest rates  potential changes in interest rates  regional economies  liquidity  business strategies and other factors 
the alco meets regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  purchase and sale activities  commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments and borrowings 
additionally  the alco reviews liquidity  cash flow flexibility  maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity 
management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk i an analysis of relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and ii an interest rate shock simulation model 
the company has traditionally managed its business to reduce its overall exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company manages its exposure to interest rates by structuring its balance sheet in the ordinary course of business 
the company does not enter into instruments such as leveraged derivatives  interest rate swaps  financial options  financial future contracts or forward delivery contracts for the purpose of reducing interest rate risk 
an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market interest rates 
the management of interest rate risk is performed by analyzing the maturity and repricing relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at specific points in time gap and by analyzing the effects of interest rate changes on net interest income over specific periods of time by projecting the performance of the mix of assets and liabilities in varied interest rate environments 
interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income of a movement in interest rates 
a company is considered to be asset sensitive  or having a positive gap  when the amount of its interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest bearing liabilities also maturing or repricing within that time period 
conversely  a company is considered to be liability sensitive  or having a negative gap  when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest earning assets also maturing or repricing within that time period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
the following table sets forth an interest rate sensitivity analysis for the company at december  volumes subject to repricing within greater than days days days one year total dollars in thousands interest earning assets securities net of unrealized gain of       loans      federal funds sold and other earning assets 
total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities demand  money market and savings deposits   certificates of deposit and other time deposits      fhlb advances    total interest bearing liabilities      period gap      cumulative gap     period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets shortcomings are inherent in any gap analysis since certain assets and liabilities may not move proportionally as interest rates change 
in addition to gap analysis  the company uses an interest rate risk simulation model and shock analysis to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and the balance sheet  respectively 
contractual maturities and repricing opportunities of loans are incorporated in the model as are prepayment assumptions  maturity data and call options within the investment portfolio 
assumptions based on past experience are incorporated into the model for nonmaturity deposit accounts 
based on the company s december  simulation analysis  the company estimates that its current net interest income structure would change by approximately over a twelve month period in response to a basis point decline in rates and change by approximately over a twelve month period in response to a basis point increase in rates 
the company estimates that its current net interest income structure would change by approximately over a twelve month period in response to a basis point decline in rates and change by approximately over a twelve month period in response to a basis point increase in rates 
the results are primarily from the behavior of demand  money market and savings deposits 
the company has found that historically  interest rates on these deposits change more slowly than changes in the discount and federal funds rates 
this assumption is incorporated into the simulation model and is generally not fully reflected in a gap analysis 
liquidity liquidity involves the company s ability to raise funds to support asset growth or reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations  to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise to operate the company on an ongoing basis 
during the three years ended december   the company s liquidity needs have primarily been met by growth in core deposits  as previously discussed 
although access to purchased funds from correspondent banks is available and has been utilized on occasion to take advantage of investment opportunities  the company does not generally rely on these external funding sources 
the cash and federal funds sold position  supplemented by amortizing investment and loan portfolios  have generally created an adequate liquidity position 
asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets which are readily marketable or which will mature in the near future 
as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million  down from million  at december  the decrease was mainly due to a decrease in federal funds sold of million 
capital resources capital management consists of providing equity to support both current and future operations 
the company is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the federal reserve board and the bank is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the fdic and the texas banking department 
both the federal reserve board and the fdic have adopted risk based capital requirements for assessing bank holding company and bank capital adequacy 
these standards define capital and establish minimum capital requirements in relation to assets and off balance sheet exposure  adjusted for credit risk 
the risk based capital standards currently in effect are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among bank holding companies and banks  to account for off balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with appropriate relative risk weights 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
the risk based capital standards issued by the federal reserve board require all bank holding companies to have tier capital of at least and total risk based capital tier and tier of at least of total risk adjusted assets 
tier capital generally includes common shareholders equity and qualifying perpetual preferred stock together with related surpluses and retained earnings  less deductions for goodwill and various other intangibles 
tier capital may consist of a limited amount of intermediate term preferred stock  a limited amount of term subordinated debt  certain hybrid capital instruments and other debt securities  perpetual preferred stock not qualifying as tier capital  and a limited amount of the general valuation allowance for loan losses 
the sum of tier capital and tier capital is total risk based capital 
the federal reserve board has also adopted guidelines which supplement the risk based capital guidelines with a minimum ratio of tier capital to average total consolidated assets  or leverage ratio  of for institutions with well diversified risk  including no undue interest rate exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity  good earnings  and that are generally considered to be strong banking organizations  rated composite under applicable federal guidelines  and that are not experiencing or anticipating significant growth 
other banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 
these rules further provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels and comparable to peer group averages  without significant reliance on intangible assets 
pursuant to fdicia  each federal banking agency revised its risk based capital standards to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk and the risks of nontraditional activities  as well as reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multifamily mortgages 
the bank is subject to capital adequacy guidelines of the fdic that are substantially similar to the federal reserve board s guidelines 
also pursuant to fdicia  the fdic has promulgated regulations setting the levels at which an insured institution such as the bank would be considered well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
under the fdic s regulations  the bank is classified well capitalized for purposes of prompt corrective action
