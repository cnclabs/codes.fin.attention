special note on forward looking statements the company believes that certain statements contained in this report and in the future filings by the company with the securities and exchange commission and in the company s written and oral statements made by or with the approval of an authorized executive officer that are not historical facts constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  and the company intends that such forward looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby 
the words and phrases looking ahead  is confident  should be  will  predicted  believes  plans  intends  estimates  likely  expects and anticipates and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements reflect the company s current views with respect to future events and financial performance  but are subject to many uncertainties and factors relating to the company s operations and business environment which may affect the accuracy of forward looking statements and cause the actual results of the company to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
as a result  in some future quarter the company s operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in such an event  the trading price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
many of the factors that will determine results of operations are beyond the company s ability to control or predict 
some of the factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include o the effect of continuing unfavorable economic conditions on market growth trends in general and on the company s customers and the demand for the company s products and services in particular  o risks inherent in international operations  including possible economic  political or monetary instability and its impact on the level and profitability of foreign sales  o uncertainties relating to the company s ability to consummate its business strategy  including the unavailability of suitable acquisition candidates  or the company s inability to finance future acquisitions or successfully realize synergies and cost savings from the integration of acquired businesses  o changes in raw material costs and the company s ability to adjust selling prices  o the company s reliance on existing senior management and the impact of the loss of any of those persons or its inability to continue to identify  hire and retain qualified management personnel  o uncertainties relating to the company s ability to develop and distribute new proprietary products to respond to market needs in a timely manner and the company s ability to continue to protect its proprietary product information and technology  o the company s ability to successfully identify and implement productivity improvements and cost reduction initiatives  o the company s reliance on a small number of significant customers  o uncertainties relating to the company s ability to continue to compete effectively with other producers of specialty transferable coatings and producers of alternative products with greater financial and management resources  and o control of the company by a principal stockholder 
the risks included here are not exhaustive 
other sections of this report may describe additional factors that could adversely impact our business and financial performance 
moreover  we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors  nor can we assess the impacts of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
the company has no obligation to revise or update these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after march  or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated events 
investors should also be aware that while the company s management does from time to time  communicate with securities analysts  it is against company policy to disclose to them any material non public information or other confidential commercial information 
accordingly  investors should not assume that the company agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report 
thus  to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections  forecasts or opinions  such reports are not deemed to be the company s responsibility 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not use derivative financial instruments to address interest rate  currency  or commodity pricing risks 
the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments held by the company for which it is practicable to estimate that value 
the carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments 
the estimated fair value of accounts receivable approximated its carrying value at december  and based upon analysis of their collectability and net realizable value 
the estimated fair value of the company s long term debt approximated its carrying value at december  and december   based upon market prices for the same or similar type of financial instrument 
the company minimizes its exposure to the impact of fluctuation in foreign exchange rates in situations for certain sales for products sold in europe but manufactured in the us through the movement of production of those products to europe 
there are no other activities of the company where management believes exchange rates have a material impact with respect to the underlying transactions 
the company does not believe its exposure to changes in interest rates is significant due to the company s debt consisting primarily of fixed rates and terms
