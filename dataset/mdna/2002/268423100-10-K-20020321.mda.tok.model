from january  to december   the bank retained of funds maturing from time deposits 
analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rate earned or paid on them 
average balance sheet 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the bank for the years ended december   and the average yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown and reflect annualized yields and costs 
average balances are derived from average monthly balances 
the yields and costs include fees which are considered adjustments to yields

these increases were partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million to million at december  as compared to million at december  the growth in total assets was funded by increases in borrowed money and savings deposits 
borrowed money  representing fhlb advances  increased by million to million at december  as compared to million at december  savings deposits increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase in deposits is largely due to increased advertising and a new branch office 
stockholders equity increased by million to million at december  as compared to million at december  this increase is primarily the result of the company s net income during the year and a  increase in the company s accumulated other comprehensive income relating to its available for sale investment portfolio  offset by stock repurchases and dividends paid

the largest component was an increase of million in mortgage loan interest income for the year ended december  this resulted from an increase in average balance of million  the average yield remained unchanged at for both year end periods 
this was partially offset by a decrease of  in interest income on investment and mortgage backed securities available for sale and short term deposits 
this resulted from an increase in average balance of million offset by a decrease in average yield of basis points 
overall  the average yield on the bank s interest earning assets decreased by basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in average yield is due to a general decline in interest rates 
the average balance of interest earning assets increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in interest expense

at december   the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was compared to at december  the ratio of the allowance to total loans was and at december  and  respectively 
net charge offs totaled  and  in and  respectively 
management periodically calculates an allowance sufficiency analysis based upon the portfolio composition  asset classifications  loan to value ratios  impairments in the current loan portfolio  and other factors 
this analysis is designed to reflect credit losses for specifically identified loans  as well as credit losses in the remainder of the loan portfolio 
the reserve methodology employed by management reflects the difference in degree of risk between the various categories of loans in the bank s portfolio 
the reserve methodology also critically assesses those loans adversely classified in the portfolio by management as doubtful  substandard or special mention 
these allowance components are set at a higher factor than the non classified one to four family loans in the portfolio to reflect the greater level of risk to which management believes the bank is exposed 
management believes that the provision for loan losses and the allowance for loan losses are currently adequate to cover probable losses in the existing loan portfolio 
while management estimates loan losses using the best available information  no assurance can be given that future additions to the allowance will not be necessary based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions  further information obtained regarding problem loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of management s control

while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit outflows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the primary investing activities of the bank are the origination of primarily residential one to four family loans and  to a lesser extent  multi family and commercial real estate  construction and land  commercial and consumer loans and the purchase of mortgage backed and mortgage related securities

from december  to december   the bank experienced an retention rate of funds maturing from certificates of deposit 
it has been and will continue to be a priority of management to retain time deposits 
the bank relies primarily on competitive rates  customer service  and long standing relationships with customers to retain deposits 
from time to time  the bank will also offer competitive special products to its customers to increase retention 
based upon the bank s experience with deposit retention and current retention strategies  management believes that  although it is not possible to predict future terms and conditions upon renewal  a significant portion of such deposits will remain with the bank 
at december   the bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements with a leverage capital level of million  or of adjusted assets  which is above the required level of million  or  and risk based capital of million  or of adjusted assets  which is above the required level of million  or

the company believes that stock repurchases are a good way to manage its excess capital and a sound investment decision 
the primary source of funding for the company is dividend payments from the bank  sales and maturities of investment securities and  to a lesser extent  earnings on investments and deposits held by the company 
dividend payments by the bank have primarily been used to fund stock repurchase programs and pay dividends on company stock 
these repurchases totaled million as of december  the bank s ability to pay dividends and other capital distributions to the company is generally limited by the provisions of the illinois state banking regulations and the federal deposit insurance corporation 
additionally  the illinois state banking commissioner and federal deposit insurance corporation may prohibit the payment of dividends which are otherwise permissible by regulation for safety and soundness reasons 
under illinois banking law  an illinois state chartered stock savings bank may declare and pay dividends out of its net profits  unless there is an impairment of capital  but approval of the commissioner is required if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed of the bank s net profits for that year if the bank has total capital of less than of total assets 
a savings bank may not declare dividends in excess of its net profits in any year without the approval of the commissioner 
to the extent the bank were to apply to pay a dividend or capital distribution to the company in excess of the regulatory permitted dividend amounts  no assurances can be made such application would be approved by the regulatory authorities 
see also regulation and supervision on page impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented in this annual report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the bank s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the bank s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
impact of accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  was issued by the fasb in september sfas no 
supercedes and replaces fasb sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
accordingly  sfas no 
is now the authoritative accounting literature for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
sfas no 
also includes several additional disclosure requirements in the area of securitized financial assets and collateral arrangements 
the provisions of sfas no 
related to transfers of financial assets are to be applied to all transfers of assets occurring after march  the collateral recognition and disclosure provisions in sfas no 
were effective for fiscal years ending december  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 
and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under the purchase method and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
sfas no 
addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas no 
provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized  but will rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
sfas no 
is effective january  for calendar year companies  however  any acquired goodwill or intangible assets recorded in transactions closed subsequent to june  will be subject immediately to the nonamortization and amortization provisions of sfas no 
the company anticipates that the adoption of sfas no 
and no 
on january  will not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the bank s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a net portfolio value model which generates estimates of the change in the bank s net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio  under any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the model assumes estimated loan prepayment rates  reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates similar to the assumptions utilized for the gap table 
the sensitivity measure is the decline in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a increase or decrease in rates  whichever produces a larger decline 
the higher the institution s sensitivity ratio  the greater its exposure to interest rate risk is considered to be 
the following npv table sets forth the bank s npv as of december  change in interest rates in basis points rate shock net portfolio value npv as of portfolio value of assets amount change change npv ratio change dollars in thousands static certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv require certain assumptions which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv table presented assumes that the composition of the bank s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv table provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
for a further discussion regarding quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk  see item of this form k  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management of interest rate risk and market risk analysis
