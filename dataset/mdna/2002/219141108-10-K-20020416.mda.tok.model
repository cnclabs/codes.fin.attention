item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a leading provider of privatized correctional  treatment and educational services outsourced by federal  state and local government agencies 
the company provides a diversified portfolio of services for adults and juveniles through its three operating divisions adult secure institutional services  juvenile treatment  education and detention services and pre release correctional and treatment services 
as of december   the company had contracts to operate facilities with a total service capacity of  the company s facilities are located in states and the district of columbia 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated total service capacity  the service capacity and contracted beds in operation at the end of the periods shown and the average occupancy percentages 
year ended december  total service capacity residential    non residential community based    total    service capacity in operation end of period    contracted beds in operation end of period    average occupancy based on contracted beds in operation average occupancy excluding start up operations the company s service capacity is comprised of the number of beds available for service upon completion of construction of residential facilities and the average program capacity of non residential community based programs 
the utah doc selected the company s bid in june for the bed timpie valley correctional facility subject to final contract negotiations 
in  the utah doc declined to pursue this project  therefore the company s service capacity was reduced accordingly 
occupancy percentages are based on contracted service capacity of residential facilities in operation 
since certain facilities have service capacities that exceed contracted capacities  occupancy percentages can exceed of contracted capacity 
occupancy percentages reflect less than normalized occupancy during the start up phase of any applicable facility  resulting in a lower average occupancy in periods when the company has substantial start up activities 
from to the company completed eight acquisitions 
the acquisitions have generally targeted companies that assist the company in penetrating new markets  diversifying its revenues and establishing a nationally recognized presence 
to fulfill this strategy  the company has acquired companies that have a reputation for high quality in the corrections and treatment industry 
the company derives substantially all its revenues from providing corrections  treatment and educational services outsourced by federal  state and local government agencies in the united states 
revenues for the company s services are generally recognized on a per diem rate based upon the number of occupant days or hours served for the period  on a guaranteed take or pay basis or on a cost plus reimbursement basis 
factors which the company considers in determining the per diem rate to charge include the programs specified by the contract and the related staffing levels  wage levels customary in the respective geographic areas  whether the proposed facility is to be leased or purchased and the anticipated average occupancy levels which the company believes could reasonably be maintained 
although the company has experienced higher operating margins in its adult secure institutional and pre release divisions as compared to the juvenile division  the company s operating margins generally vary from facility to facility based on whether the facility is owned or leased  the level of competition for the contract award  the proposed length of the contract  the occupancy levels for a facility  the level of capital commitment required with respect to a facility  the anticipated changes in operating costs over the term of the contract  and the company s ability to increase contract revenues 
the company has and expects to experience interim period operating margin differences due to the number of calendar days in the period  higher payroll taxes in the first half of the year  and salary and wage increases that are incurred prior to certain contract revenue increases 
the company is responsible for all facility operating expenses  except for certain debt service and lease payments with respect to facilities for which the company has only a management contract facilities in operation at december  
a majority of the company s facility operating expenses consist of fixed costs 
these fixed costs include lease and rental expense  insurance  utilities and depreciation 
as a result  when the company commences operation of new or expanded facilities  fixed operating expenses increase 
the amount of the company s variable operating expenses  including food  medical services  supplies and clothing  depend on occupancy levels at the facilities operated by the company 
the company s largest single operating expense  facility payroll expense and related employment taxes and costs  has both a fixed and a variable component 
the company can adjust the staffing levels and payroll expense to a certain extent based on occupancy at a facility  but a minimum fixed number of employees is required to operate and maintain any facility regardless of occupancy levels 
personnel costs are subject to increase in tightening labor markets based on local economic and other conditions 
following a contract award  the company incurs pre opening and start up expenses including payroll  benefits  training and other operating costs prior to opening a new or expanded facility and during the period of operation while occupancy is ramping up 
these costs vary by contract 
since pre opening and start up costs are factored into the revenue per diem rate that is charged to the contracting agency  the company typically expects to recover these upfront costs over the life of the contract 
because occupancy rates during a facility s start up phase typically result in capacity under utilization for at least to days  the company may incur additional post opening start up costs 
the company does not anticipate post opening start up costs at facilities operating under any future contracts with the fbop because these contracts are currently take or pay  meaning that the fbop will pay the company at least of the contractual monthly revenue once the facility opens regardless of actual occupancy 
newly opened facilities are staffed according to contract requirements when the company begins receiving offenders or clients 
offenders or clients are typically assigned to a newly opened facility on a phased in basis over a one to six month period  although certain programs require a longer time period to reach break even occupancy levels 
the company incurs start up operating losses at new facilities until break even occupancy levels are reached 
although the company typically recovers these upfront costs over the life of the contract  quarterly results can be substantially affected by the timing of the commencement of operations as well as development and construction of new facilities 
working capital requirements generally increase immediately prior to the company s commencing management of a new or expanded facility as the company incurs start up costs and purchases necessary equipment and supplies before facility management revenue is realized 
in january  the company adopted statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities  or sop  and recorded a net of tax charge of approximately million for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
as a result of the company s adoption of sop  the company began to expense pre opening and start up costs as incurred 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs for the company s corporate and administrative personnel who provide senior management  finance  accounting  human resources  payroll  information systems and other services and costs of business development

the company s synthetic lease documents  as amended in july  provide for the equity investor to fund of project costs 
there are provisions in the lease and related credit documents for the lenders and synthetic lease investor to fund and be paid interest  yield and fees 
under current gaap rules  the payment of any yield and fees to the investors is required to be treated as a return of capital rather than a return on capital 
the synthetic lease investor for the above projects received certain customary payments to assist as co arranger in the structure of the initial million synthetic lease facility in and in july when the synthetic lease facility was increased to million 
although the company does not believe the lessor is a special purpose entity  the lessor could be considered as a virtual special purpose entity under certain accounting interpretations 
therefore  these payments could be interpreted to reduce the synthetic lease investor s equity ownership in the leased projects below the required level as of the second quarter of if that were the case  these synthetic leases would no longer qualify for off balance sheet treatment beginning in the second quarter of accordingly  the assets and liabilities and results of operations of the synthetic lease owned by the synthetic lease investor are consolidated in the company s financial statements beginning in the second quarter of see recent developments 
as a result of consolidating the synthetic lease assets and liabilities  the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the depreciation expense on the associated properties and interest expense related to the synthetic lease investor s debt  instead of rent expense 
the synthetic lease investor s note a and note b have total credit commitments of million and million  respectively 
the synthetic lease investor s notes a and b are cross collateralized with the company s revolving line of credit and contain cross default provisions 
on august   the company repaid the million of outstanding senior secured notes with a portion of the proceeds from the sale and leaseback transaction 
extraordinary charges 
in august  the company used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale and leaseback transaction to retire million of outstanding senior secured notes which had a maturity date of july  as a result  the company recognized an extraordinary charge of  net of related income taxes of  in the third quarter of due to the write off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs related to the senior secured notes 
in december  the company repaid the million outstanding on its subordinated notes which had a maturity date of july  as a result  the company recognized an extraordinary charge of million net of related income taxes of million in the fourth quarter of comprised of the write offs of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs and debt discount and assessed contractual prepayment fees 
new facilities and project under development 
the new morgan academy was completed and became operational in two phases during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of in april  the company was awarded a contract to design  build and operate a  bed prison for the fbop in moshannon valley  pennsylvania the moshannon valley correctional center 
construction and activation activities commenced immediately 
in june  the fbop issued a stop work order pending a re evaluation of their environmental documentation supporting the decision to award the contract 
the environmental study was completed with a finding of no significant impact and the stop work order was lifted by the fbop on august  in september  the company received correspondence from the office of the attorney general of the commonwealth of pennsylvania indicating its belief that the operation of a private prison in pennsylvania is unlawful 
the company and the fbop have had  and continue to have  discussions with the attorney general s staff regarding these and related issues 
management anticipates that these discussions will be resolved in the near term 
as of december   the company had incurred approximately million for construction and land development costs and capitalized interest for the moshannon valley correctional center 
according to the fbop contract  as amended  the company must complete the construction of the project by april  the company will not be able to complete construction within that time frame 
while the fbop has not asserted any default or made any claim  if the company is not able to negotiate a contract amendment with the fbop  then the fbop may have the right to assert that the company has not completed construction of the project within the time frames provided in the fbop contract  as amended 
in the event that the fbop desires to continue with the moshannon valley correctional center  management expects that the contract will be amended to address cost and construction timing matters resulting from the extended delay 
in the event that the fbop decides not to continue with the moshannon project and terminates the contract  management believes that the company has the right to recover its invested costs 
in the event any portion of these costs are determined not to be reimbursed upon contract termination  such costs would be expensed 
at december   accounts receivable include costs totaling million for direct costs incurred by the company since the issuance of the stop work order in june for payroll and other operating costs related to the moshannon valley correctional center 
these costs were incurred with the understanding that such costs would be reimbursed 
although no formal written agreement exists  management believes that these costs will be reimbursed by the fbop in the near term 
in the event any portion of these costs are not reimbursed  such costs will be expensed if they are determined not to be reimbursable 
development and construction costs for the new morgan academy and the moshannon valley correctional center have been financed with the company s synthetic lease financing arrangement discussed under long term credit facilities 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million and related primarily to a bed expansion at the big spring complex  construction costs for the new morgan academy and the moshannon valley correctional center  the purchase and renovation of a building and related furniture and equipment purchases for an expansion at acaf  purchases of furniture and equipment for the new morgan academy and various facility improvements and furniture and equipment purchases 
future liquidity 
management believes that the company s existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operations  together with the revolving credit available under the credit facility and the lease financing capacity thereunder  will provide sufficient liquidity to meet the company s committed capital and working capital requirements for currently awarded and certain potential future contracts 
to the extent the company s cash and current financing arrangements do not provide sufficient financing to fund construction costs related to future adult secure institutional contract awards or significant facility expansions  the company anticipates obtaining additional sources of financing to fund such activities 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available  or will be available on terms favorable to the company 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the company has assumed various financial obligations and commitments in the ordinary course of conducting its business 
the company has contractual obligations requiring future cash payments under its existing contractual arrangements  such as management  consultative and non competition agreements 
the company maintains operating leases in the ordinary course of its business activities 
these leases include those for operating facilities  office space and office and operating equipment  and the terms of the agreements vary from until as of december   the company s total commitment under operating leases were approximately million 
the following table details the company s known future cash payments on an undiscounted basis related to various contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total thereafter contractual obligations long term debt      capital lease obligations operating leases      consultative and non competition agreements   total contractual cash obligations      the company enters into letters of credit in the ordinary course of operating and financing activities 
as of december   the company had outstanding letters of credit of million related to insurance and other operating activities 
the following table details the company s letter of credit commitments as of december  in thousands amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts less than over committed year years years years commercial commitments standby letters of credit   critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepts in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements require that management make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates on an on going basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant adjustments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company extends credit to the government agencies contracted with other parties in the normal course of business 
further  the company regularly reviews outstanding receivables  and provides estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluating the level of established reserves  the company makes judgments regarding its customers ability to make required payments  economic events and other factors 
as the financial condition of these parties change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of its net assets 
in providing for deferred taxes  the company considers current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if tax regulations  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
the company maintains coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
the company retains a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and retention under self insurance programs 
the company regularly reviews the estimates of reported and unreported claims and provides for losses through insurance reserves 
as claims develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required 
inflation other than personnel and offender medical costs at certain facilities during  management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the company s results of operations during the past three years 
most of the company s facility management contracts provide for payments to the company of either fixed per diem fees or per diem fees that increase by only small amounts during the term of the contracts 
inflation could substantially increase the company s personnel costs the largest component of operating expenses or other operating expenses at rates faster than any increases in contract revenues 
risk factors and cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of this report contains or incorporates by reference forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements are based on current plans and expectations of management and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual future activities and results of operations to be materially different from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ include  among others  risks associated with acquisitions and the integration thereof including the ability to achieve administrative and operating cost savings and anticipated synergies  the timing and costs of expansions of existing facilities  changes in governmental policy to eliminate or discourage the privatization of correctional  detention and pre release services in the united states  availability of debt and equity financing on terms that are favorable to the company  fluctuations in operating results because of occupancy  competition including competition from two competitors that are substantially larger than the company  increases in cost of operations  fluctuations in interest rates and risks of operations and significant charges to operating expense of deferred costs associated with financing and other projects in development if management determines that one or more of such projects is unlikely to be successfully concluded 
where any forward looking statement includes a statement of the assumptions or bases underlying the forward looking statement  the company cautions that  while it believes these assumptions or bases to be reasonable and in good faith  assumed facts or bases almost always vary from the actual results  and differences between assumed facts or bases and actual results can be material  depending upon the circumstances 
where  in any forward looking statement  the company or its management express an expectation or belief as to future results  that expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and is believed to have a reasonable basis 
the company cannot assure you  however  that the statement of expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished 
the words believe  expect  estimate  anticipate and similar expressions will generally identify forward looking statements 
all of the company s forward looking statements  whether written or oral  are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements and any other cautionary statements that may accompany such forward looking statements 
in addition  the company disclaims any obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report 
with this in mind  you should consider the risks discussed elsewhere in this report and other documents the company files with the commission from time to time and the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made by the company or on its behalf 
public resistance to privatization of correctional and detention facilities could result in the company s inability to obtain new contracts or the loss of existing contracts 
management of correctional and detention facilities by private entities has not achieved complete acceptance by either the government or the public 
the movement toward privatization of correctional and detention facilities has also encountered resistance from certain groups  such as labor unions  local sheriff s departments  and groups believing that correctional and detention facility operations should only be conducted by government agencies 
changes in the dominant political party in any market in which correctional facilities are located could have an adverse impact on privatization 
further  some government agencies are not legally permitted to delegate their traditional management responsibilities for correctional and detention facilities to private companies 
any of these resistances may make it more difficult for the company to renew or maintain existing contracts  to obtain new contracts or sites on which to operate new facilities or to develop or purchase facilities and lease them to government or private entities  any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company is subject to the short term nature of government contracts 
many governmental agencies are legally limited in their ability to enter into long term contracts that would bind elected officials responsible for future budgets 
therefore  many contracts with government agencies typically either have a very short term or are subject to termination on short notice without cause 
in addition  the company s contracts with government agencies may contain one or more renewal options that may be exercised only by the contracting government agency 
no assurance can be given that any agency will exercise a renewal option in the future 
the non renewal or termination of any of the company s significant contracts with governmental agencies could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operation and liquidity  including its ability to secure new facility management contracts from others 
the company is dependent on government appropriations 
if government appropriation levels are reduced  the company s business may be harmed 
the company s cash flow is subject to the receipt of sufficient funding of and timely payment by contracting governmental entities 
if the appropriate governmental agency does not receive sufficient appropriations to cover its contractual obligations  a contract may be terminated or the amounts payable to the company may be deferred or reduced 
any delays in payment  or the termination of a significant contract  could have an adverse effect on the company s cash flow and financial condition 
moreover  as a result of the slowing economy and the events of september   federal  state and local governments may encounter unusual budgetary constraints and there is a risk that spending on outsourced services provided by the company may be curtailed 
the company s ability to win new contracts to develop and manage correctional  detention and treatment facilities depends on many factors outside its control 
the company s growth is generally dependent upon its ability to win new contracts to develop and manage new correctional  detention and treatment facilities 
this depends on a number of factors the company cannot control  including crime rates and sentencing patterns in various jurisdictions 
accordingly  the demand for the company s facilities could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts  leniency in conviction and sentencing practices or through the legal decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by criminal laws 
for instance  any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested  convicted and sentenced  thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them 
similarly  reductions in crime rates could lead to reductions in arrests  convictions and sentences requiring correctional facilities 
the bureau of justice statistics reports that the level of violent crime in the united states has declined steadily since and the level of property crime is at the lowest level since however  the number of detained offenders has grown steadily during that period 
while the company believes that governments will continue to privatize correctional  detention and treatment facilities  the company believes the rate of growth experienced in the state private corrections industry during the late s and early s is moderating 
certain jurisdictions recently have required successful bidders to make a significant capital investment in connection with the financing of a particular project  a trend that could require the company to have sufficient capital resources to compete effectively 
the company may not be able to obtain these capital resources when needed 
additionally  the company s success in obtaining new awards and contracts may depend  in part  upon its ability to locate land that can be leased or acquired under favorable terms 
otherwise desirable locations may be in or near populated areas and  therefore  may generate legal action or other forms of opposition from residents in areas surrounding a proposed site 
the company s profitability may suffer if the number of offenders occupying its correctional  detention and treatment facilities decreases 
the company s correctional  detention and treatment facilities are dependent upon government agencies supplying offenders 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues is generated under contracts that specify a net rate per day per resident  or a per diem rate  sometimes with no minimum guaranteed occupancy levels  even though most correctional facility cost structures are relatively fixed 
under such a per diem rate structure  a decrease in occupancy levels at a particular facility could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations at such facility 
a failure to comply with existing regulations could result in material penalties or non renewal or termination of the company s contracts to manage correctional  detention and treatment facilities 
the company s industry is subject to a variety of federal  state and local regulations  including education  health care and safety regulations  which are administered by various regulatory authorities 
the company may not always successfully comply with these regulations  and failure to comply could result in material penalties or non renewal or termination of facility management contracts 
the contracts typically include extensive reporting requirements and supervision and on site monitoring by representatives of contracting government agencies 
corrections officers are customarily required to meet certain training standards  and in some instances facility personnel are required to be licensed and subject to background investigation 
certain jurisdictions also require the subcontracts to be awarded on a competitive basis or to subcontract with businesses owned by members of minority groups 
the company s facilities are also subject to operational and financial audits by the governmental agencies with which the company has contracts 
the failure to comply with any applicable laws  rules or regulations and the loss of any required license could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations at the company s affected facilities 
government agencies may investigate and audit the company s contracts and  if any improprieties are found  the company may be required to refund revenues it has received  to forego anticipated revenues and may be subject to penalties and sanctions  including prohibitions on the company s bidding in response to requests for proposals  or rfps 
certain of the government agencies the company contracts with have the authority to audit and investigate the company s contracts with them 
as part of that process  the government agency reviews the company s performance on the contract  its pricing practices  its cost structure and its compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
if the agency determines that the company has improperly allocated costs to a specific contract  the company may not be reimbursed for those costs and the company could be required to refund the amount of any such costs that have been reimbursed 
if a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities by the company or the company otherwise determines that these activities have occurred  the company may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeitures of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or disqualification from doing business with the government 
any adverse determination could adversely impact the company s ability to bid in response to rfps in one or more jurisdictions 
if the company fails to satisfy its contractual obligations  the company s ability to compete for future contracts and its financial condition may be adversely affected 
the company s failure to comply with contract requirements or to meet its client s performance expectations when performing a contract could materially and adversely affect the company s financial performance and its reputation  which  in turn  would impact the company s ability to compete for new contracts 
the company s failure to meet contractual obligations could also result in substantial actual and consequential damages 
in addition  the company s contracts often require it to indemnify clients for the company s failure to meet performance standards 
some of the company s contracts contain liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to performance failures 
although the company has liability insurance  the policy limits may not be adequate to provide protection against all potential liabilities 
new competitors in the company s industry may adversely affect the profitability of the company s business 
the company must compete on the basis of cost  quality and range of services offered  experience in managing facilities  reputation of personnel and ability to design  finance and construct new facilities on a cost effective competitive basis 
while there are barriers for companies seeking to enter into the management and operation of correctional  detention and treatment facilities  there can be no assurance that these barriers will be sufficient to limit additional competition 
a disturbance in one of the company s facilities could result in closure of a facility or harm to the company s business 
an escape  riot or other disturbance at one of the company s facilities could adversely effect the financial condition  results of operations and liquidity of the company s operations 
among other things  the adverse publicity generated as a result of an event could adversely affect the company s ability to retain an existing contract or obtain future ones 
in addition  if such an event were to occur  there is a possibility that the facility where the event occurred may be shut down by the relevant governmental agency 
a closure of certain of the company s facilities could adversely affect the financial condition  results of operations and liquidity of the company s operations 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington  dc on september   and other acts of violence or war may affect the markets in which the company s common stock trades  the markets in which the company operates and the company s profitability 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect the company s operations 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or united states businesses 
as a result of terrorism  the united states may enter into a protracted armed conflict  which could have a further impact on the company s business 
in addition  terrorists attacks in the united states may increase demand for trained security personnel  which could increase the company s operating costs 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact the company s business 
in addition  any of these events may affect the markets in which the company s common stock trades 
the consequences of any of these armed conflicts are unpredictable and the company may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on its business 
inaccurate  misleading or negative media coverage could adversely affect the company s reputation and its ability to bid for government contracts 
the media frequently focuses its attention on private operators contracts with government agencies 
if the media coverage is negative  it could influence government officials to slow the pace of outsourcing government services  which could reduce the number of rfps 
the media may also focus its attention on the activities of political consultants engaged by the company  even when their activities are unrelated to the company s business  and the company may be tainted by adverse media coverage about their activities 
moreover  inaccurate  misleading or negative media coverage about the company could harm its reputation and  accordingly  its ability to bid for and win government contracts 
the company may incur significant costs before receiving related revenues  which could result in cash shortfalls 
when the company is awarded a contract to manage a government program  it may incur significant expenses before the company receives contract payments 
these expenses include leasing office space  purchasing office equipment and hiring and training personnel 
as a result  in certain large contracts where the government does not fund program pre opening and start up costs  the company may be required to invest significant sums of money before receiving related contract payments 
in addition  payments due to the company from government agencies may be delayed due to billing cycles or as a result of failures to approve governmental budgets and finalize contracts in a timely manner 
the company may be unable to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel necessary to sustain its business 
the company s delivery of services is labor intensive 
when the company is awarded a government contract  the company must hire operating management  security  case management and other personnel 
the success of the company s business requires that the company attract  develop  motivate and retain these personnel 
the company s inability to hire sufficient personnel on a timely basis or the loss of significant numbers of personnel could adversely affect its business 
if the company is unable to manage its growth  its profitability will be adversely affected 
sustaining the company s growth has placed significant demands on the company s management as well as on its administrative  operational and financial resources 
for the company to continue to manage its growth  the company must continue to improve its operational  financial and management information systems and expand  motivate and manage its workforce 
if the company s growth comes at the expense of providing quality service and generating reasonable profits  the company s ability to successfully bid for contracts and its profitability will be adversely affected 
unsuccessful financing or acquisition projects may result in charges to expense for deferred costs 
if the company determines that one or more financing or acquisition projects is unlikely to be successfully concluded  the company could incur significant charges to expense for deferred costs associated with such projects 
if the company does not successfully integrate the businesses that it acquires  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company may be unable to manage businesses that it may acquire profitably or integrate them successfully without incurring substantial expenses  delays or other problems that could negatively impact the company s results of operations 
moreover  business combinations involve additional risks  including o diversion of management s attention  o loss of key personnel  o assumption of unanticipated legal or financial liabilities  o the company s becoming significantly leveraged as a result of the incurrence of debt to finance an acquisition  o unanticipated operating  accounting or management difficulties in connection with the acquired entities  o amortization or charges of acquired intangible assets  including goodwill  and o dilution to the company s earnings per share 
also  client dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business could materially and adversely affect the company s reputation as a whole 
further  the acquired businesses may not achieve the revenues and earnings the company anticipated 
because federal environmental laws impose strict as well as joint and several liability for clean up costs  unforeseen environmental risks could prove to be costly 
the company s facilities may be subject to unforeseen environmental risks 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  as amended  or cercla  imposes strict  as well as joint and several  liability for certain environmental cleanup costs on several classes of potentially responsible parties  including current owners and operators of the property and  in some cases  lenders who did not cause or contribute to the contamination 
furthermore  liability under cercla is not limited to the original or unamortized principal balance of a loan or to the value of the property securing a loan 
other federal and state laws in certain circumstances may impose liability for environmental remediation  which costs may be substantial 
moreover  certain federal statutes and certain states by statute impose a lien for any cleanup costs incurred by such state on the property that is the subject of such cleanup costs 
all subsequent liens on such property generally are subordinated to such an environmental lien and  in some states  even prior recorded liens are subordinated to environmental liens 
the company is the subject of class action lawsuits that  if decided against it  could have a negative effect on its financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
in march  the company  steven w 
logan and john l 
hendrix  were named as defendants in two lawsuits styled graydon williams  on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated v 
cornell companies  inc  et al  no 
h  in the united states district court for the southern district of texas  houston division  and richard picard  on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated v 
cornell companies  inc  et al  no 
h  in the united states district court for the southern district of texas  houston division 
the aforementioned lawsuits are putative class action lawsuits brought on behalf of all purchasers of the company s common stock between march  and march  the lawsuits involve disclosures made concerning two prior transactions executed by the company the sale and leaseback transaction and the synthetic lease transaction 
the plaintiffs allege that the defendants violated section b of the exchange act  rule b promulgated under section b of the exchange act  and or section a of the exchange act 
the company believes that it has good defenses to each of the plaintiffs claims and intends to vigorously defend against each of the claims 
also in march  the company  its directors  and its independent auditor arthur andersen llp  were sued in a derivative action styled as william williams derivatively and on behalf of nominal defendant cornell companies  inc 
v 
anthony r 
chase  et al  no 
 in the th judicial district court of harris county  texas 
the lawsuit alleges breaches of fiduciary duty by all of the individual defendants and asserts breach of contract and professional negligence claims only against arthur andersen llp 
the company believes that it has good defenses to each of the plaintiff s claims and intends to vigorously defend against each of the claims 
while the plaintiffs in these cases have not quantified their claim of damages and the outcome of the matters discussed above cannot be predicted with certainty  based on information known to date  management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  operating results or cash flow 
certain insurance policies held by the company to cover potential director and officer liability may limit the company s cash outflows in the event of a decision adverse to the company in the matters discussed above 
however  if an adverse decision in these matters exceeds the insurance coverage or if the insurance coverage is deemed not to apply to these matters  an adverse decision to the company in this matter could have a material adverse effect on the company  its financial position  its operating results or cash flow 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to market risk  primarily from changes in interest rates 
the company continually monitors exposure to market risk and develops appropriate strategies to manage this risk 
the company is not exposed to any other significant market risks  including commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk or interest rate risks from the use of derivative financial instruments 
management does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in interest rates or commodity prices 
interest rate exposure the company s exposure to changes in interest rates primarily results from its long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates 
the debt on the company s consolidated financial statements with fixed interest rates consists of the bonds issued by mcf in august in connection with the sale and leaseback transaction 
at december   approximately million of debt outstanding to the synthetic lease investor of the company s consolidated long term debt was subject to variable interest rates 
the detrimental effect of a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would be to reduce income before provision for income taxes by approximately  for the year ended december  at december   the fair value of the company s consolidated fixed rate debt approximated carrying value based upon discounted future cash flows using current market prices
