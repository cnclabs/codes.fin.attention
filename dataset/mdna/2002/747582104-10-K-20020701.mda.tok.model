critical accounting procedures the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  uncollectible accounts receivables  and intangible assets for reasonableness 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources

the company suggests that significant accounting policies  as described in its consolidated financial statements in note  summary of significant accounting policies  be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
the company s revenues are primarily generated from the sale of software licenses  maintenance fees  and edi services 
revenue recognition is governed by statement of position  software revenue recognition sop 
per sop  if the arrangement does not require significant production  modification  or customization of software  revenue should be recognized when all of the following criteria are met o persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  o delivery has occurred  o the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable  and o collectibility is probable 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  the recognition of software license revenues is based on the company s assessment that the above criteria has been met 
in general  the first two criteria are met with a signed contract and evidence that the company has shipped its software to the customer 
in those cases where undelivered elements of a system sales exist  the company defers revenue related to the undelivered element based on vendor specific objective evidence of each element s fair value 
the company bases each element s fair value on its price list which is used in pricing all contracts 
discounts for individual elements are aggregated  and the total discount is allocated back to the individual elements in its proportion of fair value to the total contract fair value 
the company determines that its fee is fixed and determinable based on the contract terms  which specify payment terms tied to dates and not to any future deliverables 
probability of collection is based on a credit review of new customers 
the timing or amount of revenue recognition may have been different if different assessments of the above criteria had been made at the time transactions were recorded in revenue 
valuation allowances 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill impairment 
the company s long lived assets include goodwill of million as of march  and  respectively 
the company adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas effective april  the new statement applies to the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company has ceased amortizing amounts related to goodwill starting april  the balance of goodwill is related to the company s nextgen division 
the company has compared the fair value of the nextgen division with the carrying amount of assets associated with the division and determined that none of the goodwill recorded as of june  was impaired 
the fair value of the nextgen division was determined using a reasonable estimate of future cash flows of the division and a risk adjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of future cash flows 
the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of the company s business segments 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations  and assumptions about the company s strategic plans with regard to operations 
to the extent additional information arises or the strategies of the company change  it is possible that the company s conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change and result in a material effect on its financial position or results of operations

a higher level of hardware content in new systems sales at the nextgen division was primarily responsible for reducing gross margins in that division from in the year ended march  to in the year ended march  the decline in gross margins at the nextgen division was offset by certain reductions in headcount and other expenses at the qsi division  where gross margins increased from in the year ended march  to in the year ended march  in addition  the company s gross margin percentage was impacted as the nextgen division  which has a higher gross margin than the qsi division  increased its share of total company revenues to from in the prior year
