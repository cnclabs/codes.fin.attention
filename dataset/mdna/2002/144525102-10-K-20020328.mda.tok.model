the company is comprised of two business segments 
see note twelve to the consolidated financial statements for financial information about these business segments 
the company sells prescription and nonprescription human and veterinary products through its medical services division and consumer and bulk raw material products through its consumer products subsidiary  caraloe  inc the company s research and product portfolio are based primarily on complex carbohydrates isolated from the aloe vera l

customers with significant accounts receivable balances at the end of included mannatech  inc  and medline industries  and of these amounts   has been collected as of march as of december   the company had no material capital commitments other than its leases and agreements with suppliers 
in march  the company  with four other investors  formed aloe and herbs international inc  a panamanian corporation  with the sole intent of acquiring a  acre tract of land in costa rica to be used for the production of aloe vera l 
leaves to be sold to the company at competitive  local market rates 
this would allow the company to save approximately on the per kilogram cost of leaves as compared to the cost of importing leaves from other central and south american countries 
aloe herbs subsequently formed a wholly owned subsidiary  rancho aloe cr  cr  a costa rica corporation  which acquired the land in april the company provided a cash advance of  which is evidenced by a note receivable  due in installments  with payments being made monthly based upon farm production 
the company also advanced  to aloe herbs in november for the acquisition of an irrigation system to improve production on the farm and allow harvesting of leaves year round 
the company was also granted a five year warrant to purchase  shares of common stock of aloe herbs 
in the fourth quarter of  the company fully reserved all amounts owed to it by aloe herbs  in the total amount of  due to the start up nature of the business 
in  the company received payments totaling  from aloe herbs against the amount due 
the first shipment of leaves from rancho aloe to the company was made in march and the company purchased a total of  of aloe vera l 
leaves from rancho aloe the company s interest in aloe herbs at december  is approximately 
in november  the company entered into an agreement with comerica bank texas for a  line of credit  secured by accounts receivable and inventory 
this credit facility had an outstanding balance of  at december  to fund operating needs 
the company believes that its available cash resources and expected cash flows from operations will provide the funds necessary to finance its current operations 
however  the company does not expect that its current cash resources will be sufficient to finance future major clinical studies and costs of filing new drug applications necessary to develop its products to their full commercial potential 
additional funds  therefore  may need to be raised through equity offerings  borrowings  licensing arrangements or other means  and there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such funds on satisfactory terms when they are needed

see market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters above 
the company believes it has the financial resources necessary to repurchase shares from time to time pursuant to the board s repurchase authorization 
management has identified the following accounting policies as critical 
our accounting policies are more fully described in footnote of the financial statements 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenues  product returns  bad debts and inventories 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for incentive offerings including promotions and other volume based incentives as well as estimates for returns based upon recent history 
if market conditions were to decline or inventory was in danger of expiring or becoming obsolete  the company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
additionally  if demand for the company s product were to drop  the company s distributors may request return of product for credit causing a need to re evaluate and possibly increase the reserve for product returns 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company is subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
certain of the company s proposed products will require governmental approval prior to commercial use 
the approval process applicable to prescription pharmaceutical products usually takes several years and typically requires substantial expenditures 
the company and any licensees may encounter significant delays or excessive costs in their respective efforts to secure necessary approvals 
future united states or foreign legislative or administrative acts could also prevent or delay regulatory approval of the company s or any licensees products 
failure to obtain requisite governmental approvals or failure to obtain approvals of the scope requested could delay or preclude the company or any licensees from marketing their products  or could limit the commercial use of the products  and thereby have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and financial condition
