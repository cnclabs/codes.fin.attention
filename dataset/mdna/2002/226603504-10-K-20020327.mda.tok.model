item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis contains statements that may be considered forward looking 
these statements contain a number of risks and uncertainties as discussed herein and in item of this form k that could cause actual results to differ materially 
all information set forth in this annual report on form k has been retroactively adjusted to reflect a one for ten reverse stock split effected on october  results of operations versus financial statement net loss to common shareholders for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
net loss to common shareholders for the year ended december  includes million in non cash accounting impairment charges related to certain of the company s subordinated cmbs  reorganization expenses of million  a one time emergence financing origination fee expense of million related to the company s emergence from chapter in april  a million charge related to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 and million of revenue related to a change in accounting principle for servicing revenue 
excluding the impairment charges  reorganization expenses  loss emergence financing fee and the changes in accounting principles  pro forma net income to common shareholders would have been million for the year ended december   representing net earnings from the company s retained mortgage assets  as discussed more fully below 
the primary factors resulting in the net loss for the year ended december  were the recognition of a non cash accounting impairment charge of million related to certain of the company s retained subordinated cmbs and expenses related to the company s reorganization plan and the sale of certain mortgage assets during  as discussed below 
interest income subordinated cmbs income from subordinated cmbs decreased by approximately million  or  to million during as compared to million during this overall decrease in interest income was primarily the result of the sale of certain cmbs during as part of the company s reorganization plan 
generally accepted accounting principles gaap require that interest income earned on subordinated cmbs be recorded based on the effective interest method using the anticipated yield over the expected life of the subordinated cmbs 
based upon the timing and amount of future credit losses and certain other assumptions estimated by management  as discussed below  the weighted average anticipated unleveraged yield for criimi mae s subordinated cmbs for financial statement purposes as of january  was approximately  as compared to the anticipated weighted average yield used to recognize income from april  to december  of and from december  through march  these yields were determined based on the anticipated yield over the expected life of the subordinated cmbs  which considers  among other things  anticipated losses and any other than temporary impairment 
the effective interest method of recognizing interest income on subordinated cmbs results in income recognition that differs from cash received 
for the years ended december  and  the amount of income recognized in excess of cash received due to the effective interest rate method was approximately million and million  respectively 
the us economy began to slow during the latter part of accordingly  the company began to see the impact of the slowing us economy through increased defaults on mortgage loans underlying its cmbs portfolio 
this trend continued during  and as of december   approximately of the mortgage loans underlying the company s cmbs portfolio were in default 
this compares to as of december  primarily as a result of the continued slowing us economy and recession during  which were exacerbated by the terrorist attacks on september  and subsequent terrorist actions and threats  the company recognized a million non cash accounting impairment charge related to certain cmbs as of september  due to a change in estimates of expected losses 
in addition  the company recognized an additional non cash impairment charge related to certain cmbs of million as of december  as a result of the combined severity of the economic and terrorist events  the underlying mortgage loans have had a greater than previously anticipated number of monetary defaults 
these were primarily defaults related to mortgage loans on hotel properties 
additionally  recent appraisal amounts on properties underlying certain defaulted loans were significantly lower than previously anticipated  thereby increasing the estimated principal loss on the commercial loans 
as a result of the change in expected future cash flows  expected future credit losses and the recognition of impairment  the company revised its anticipated yields as of october  and again as of january  the revised weighted average yield of will be used to recognize interest income prospectively  beginning january  interest income insured mortgage securities interest income from insured mortgage securities decreased by approximately million or to million for from million for this decrease was principally due to the prepayment of nine mortgage securities and the assignment to hud of two mortgage securities held by criimi mae and its wholly owned subsidiaries for net proceeds aggregating approximately million during the year ended these prepayments represented approximately of the total insured mortgage portfolio 
interest income originated loans interest income from originated loans decreased to for as compared to million for interest income from originated loans was derived from originated loans included in the cmo iv securitization  a securitization of million face value of conduit loans in june the decrease was due to the sale of the company s interest in cmo iv in november  which eliminated interest income for versus interest expense total interest expense decreased by approximately million or to approximately million for from approximately million for this decrease was primarily attributable to the sale of the company s interest in cmo iv and certain cmbs during and the reduction of the related debt 
these decreases were partially offset by higher rates of interest incurred subsequent to april  on the company s new debt and the amortization of the related extension fees on the new debt under the effective interest method beginning in april  as compared to the interest rates incurred during on the recourse debt existing prior to emergence from chapter the overall weighted average effective interest rate on the new debt was for the period april  to december   the weighted average coupon rate on the new debt was for the period april to december  the difference in the new debt s weighted average effective interest rate and the new debt s weighted average coupon pay rate primarily relates to the amortization of estimated extension fees and the accrued interest related to the per annum  accreting interest on the series b secured notes  both of which are included in the weighted average effective interest rate  but not included in the weighted average coupon pay rate 
the weighted average effective and coupon interest rates on the recourse debt was for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased slightly to million for as compared to million for primarily due to an increase in professional fees  partially offset by lower employment costs due to fewer employees and no cmo iv mortgage servicing fees in amortization of assets acquired in the merger amortization of assets acquired in the merger was million in and in june of  the fasb issued sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
fas  among other things  prohibits the amortization of existing goodwill and establishes a new method of testing goodwill for impairment 
fas became effective for the company on january  effective upon adoption on january   the company wrote off million of goodwill and other intangible assets  and recorded a resulting one time  non cash impairment charge of approximately million for this change in accounting principle 
in addition  this change in accounting principle will reduce the company s annual amortization expense related to such assets by approximately million 
equity in losses income from investments cmslp operations beginning july   criimi mae began accounting for cmslp on a consolidated basis as opposed to accounting for cmslp using the equity method 
this change in accounting method was a result of a reorganization in which the partnership interests of cmslp are now held by two wholly owned and controlled taxable reit subsidiaries trss of criimi mae 
prior to july   criimi mae accounted for cmslp under the equity method as the company did not control the voting common stock of the general partner of cmslp 
cmslp s assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses are labeled as servicing on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the following information summarizes the financial statement presentation of the company s equity in losses income from investments and the consolidated results of operations of cmslp year ended december  description equity in losses income from investments as presented on income statements the aim funds net equity in income   cmslp cmsi net equity in losses income  b  total equity in losses income from investments  a  a a total equity in losses income from investments for the years ended december  and include criimi mae s net equity from the aim funds during these periods  and include net equity from cmslp criimi mae services  inc cmsi for six of the twelve months january june in the year ended december  since cmslp s operations are consolidated into criimi mae effective july  and for the full year ended december  on a comparative basis  the net equity from the aim funds decreased primarily due to a reduction in the aim funds mortgage assets 
the net equity in income of  from cmslp cmsi for compares to the aggregate of the net equity in losses from cmslp cmsi of  for and the net loss from cmslp of  for the six months ended december  as summarized below 
cmslp cmsi s aggregate net loss of  during includes amortization  depreciation and impairment of million in as compared to million in cmslp s total revenues decreased by approximately million  or  to million in compared to million in  primarily due to lower interest income and assumption fees resulting from low current interest rates and the decrease in mortgage loans serviced 
general and administrative expenses were million and million in and  respectively 
the increase was due primarily to an increase in information technology expenses 
in addition  includes restructuring expenses of million related to cmslp s sale of its rights and obligations under its master and primary servicing contracts

on december   cmslp announced its intention to sell all of its rights and obligations under its cmbs master and primary servicing contracts because the contracts were not profitable  given the relatively small volume of master and primary cmbs servicing that cmslp was performing 
in connection with this determination  employees were terminated 
a restructuring charge of approximately  was recorded during the fourth quarter of to account for employee severance costs  noncancellable lease costs  and other costs related to the restructuring 
all rights and obligations under these servicing contracts were sold in february cmslp received approximately million in cash  which included reimbursement of advances 
this is expected to result in a gain on sale of approximately million  subject to adjustment for certain post closing contingencies  in the second quarter of in addition  cmslp may receive up to an additional million from the sale in the third quarter of  which would be reflected as an additional gain on sale  following the completion of a post closing contingency period 
see note to notes to the consolidated financial statements 
other income other income decreased by approximately million or to million during as compared to million during this decrease was partially attributable to lower interest rates earned on fewer temporary investments 
also included in other income is approximately  in realized gains related to the company s trading of other mbs 
in october  a wholly owned subsidiary of criimi mae acquired certain partnership interests in a partnership that was the obligor on a mezzanine loan payable to criimi mae in exchange for curing a default on the first mortgage loan through a cash payment of approximately  this partnership and another wholly owned subsidiary of criimi mae own of the partnership interests in the partnership which is the obligor on the first mortgage loan 
the first mortgage loan is secured by a shopping center in orlando  florida 
as a result of this acquisition  the company  through certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries  owns of the partnership interests in the partnership which owns the real estate reo and is consolidating its accounts as of october  at the date of acquisition  the company adjusted the book values of the assets acquired and the assumed mortgage payable to fair value 
the discount on the debt of million will be amortized into interest expense over the life of the mortgage  or approximately years 
during the period october through december   the company recognized a net loss of approximately  from the operations of reo  which includes approximately  of interest expense 
the remainder of the net loss of approximately  is included in other income  net  in the consolidated statement of income 
the property is also projected to have a net loss of approximately million in  which will be included in the company s consolidated statement of income 
the company hopes to reposition and stabilize this property and then sell it when the company believes that it can sell it at a price that more accurately reflects its value  although there can be no assurance the company will be able to do so 
currently the company expects that it will hold the property for more than one year 
net losses gains on mortgage security and originated loan dispositions during  net losses on mortgage security dispositions were approximately  as a result of nine prepayments and two assignments to hud of mortgage securities held by certain of criimi mae s subsidiaries  or approximately of its related portfolio 
there were no gains or losses on originated loan dispositions in since the company s originated loans were sold in during  net gains on mortgage security and originated loan dispositions were approximately  which was comprised of net gains on mortgage security dispositions of approximately  and net gains on originated loan dispositions of  during  there were six prepayments of mortgage securities and two prepayments of originated loans 
for any year  gains or losses on mortgage dispositions are based on the number  carrying amounts and proceeds of mortgages disposed of during the period 
the proceeds realized from the disposition of mortgage assets are based on the net coupon rates of the specific mortgages disposed of in relation to prevailing long term interest rates at the date of disposition 
impairment on cmbs as of september   the company revised its overall expected loss estimate related to its cmbs portfolio from million to million 
as of december   the company again revised its overall expected loss estimate related to its cmbs portfolio from million to million over the life of the cmbs 
these revisions to loss estimates were primarily the result of the continued slowing us economy and recession  which were exacerbated by the terrorist attacks on september  and subsequent terrorist actions and threats 
as previously discussed  principally as a result of the slowing economy and terrorist actions and threats  the underlying mortgage loans have had a greater than previously anticipated number of monetary defaults 
additionally  recent appraisal amounts on properties underlying certain defaulted loans have been significantly lower than previously anticipated  thereby increasing the estimated principal loss on the commercial loans 
at february   and december   million and million  respectively  or and  respectively  in mortgage loans underlying the company s cmbs portfolio were in default 
as of december   million  or  in mortgage loans underlying the company s cmbs portfolio were in default 
as the company determined that there had been an adverse change in expected future cash flows  the company believed certain of the cmbs had been impaired under eitf and statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  sfas as of september  and december  as the fair value of the impaired cmbs was approximately million and million below the amortized cost as of september  and december   respectively  the company recorded other than temporary  non cash impairment charges through the income statement of these amounts during the third and fourth quarters of see also summary of subordinated cmbs  which follows 
the aggregate non cash accounting impairment charges of million in compare to a non cash impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of related to the company s cmbs portfolio 
these impairment charges do not reflect actual cash losses as of september  or december  there can be no assurance that the company s revised estimate of expected losses will not be exceeded as a result of additional or continuing adverse events or circumstances  such as a continuing economic slowdown or recession 
hedging loss and cumulative effect of adoption of fas during the year ended december   the company recognized a mark to market loss through earnings of approximately million on its interest rate cap and a  loss through earnings due to the adoption of sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of fas the fair value of the interest rate cap has decreased significantly due to a decline in interest rates since the cap was purchased in april the cap is set at a one month london interbank offered rate libor rate of 
as of december   the one month libor rate was 
litigation expense during  the company recorded a million expense based on the settlement of the capital company of america  llc cca chapter claim related to a letter of intent in for the purchase of subordinated cmbs 
no such expense was recorded during reorganization items during and  the company recorded reorganization items due to the chapter filings of criimi mae  cm management and holdings ii  as follows reorganization items short term interest income   professional fees   employee retention program  other   excise tax accrued  subtotal   impairment on cmbs regarding reorganization  net recovery loss on real estate owned   net gain on sale of cmbs  loss on originated loans  total reorganization expense  net   the company recognized impairment on its investment in real estate owned in this asset was sold in july the company recognized impairment on the cmbs subject to the sales of select cmbs the cmbs sale in the final bonds subject to the cmbs sale were sold in november emergence financing origination fee in connection with the emergence from chapter  in april the company paid a one time  emergence financing origination fee of approximately million related to its new variable rate secured borrowing 
gaap requires such fee to be expensed immediately 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as discussed below  the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle of million related to servicing revenue is reflected as of january  as an adjustment to net income and therefore is reflected in the year ended december  net income 
as of july   cmslp changed its accounting policy related to the recognition of special servicing fee revenue 
special servicing fees are paid to cmslp when mortgage loans collateralizing cmbs owned by the company are in default 
typically  cmslp is paid basis points of the unpaid principal balance of the defaulted mortgage loans for as long as the loans are in default 
the fees are paid to compensate the special servicer for managing and resolving the defaulted loan 
historically  cmslp had deferred special servicing fee revenue and recorded that revenue into earnings using the method consistent with the company s policy of recognizing interest income over the life of the cmbs owned by criimi mae on the level yield basis 
cmslp is now recording these special servicing fees in earnings on a current basis 
this change was made to better match revenues and expenses related to the actual special servicing of the defaulted loans 
the special servicing fees are paid on a current basis by the trusts holding the mortgage loans and those payments directly reduce the cashflow paid on the company s cmbs 
therefore  the special servicing fees paid are built into the gaap yields the company uses to record interest income on its cmbs 
cmslp has changed its accounting policy to recognize the special servicing fees in earnings on a current basis as the company believes this policy better matches the special servicing fees it earns with the direct costs expended for performing its special servicing obligations 
the cmbs and special servicing contracts are separate legal instruments or contracts 
the company is required to reflect this change in accounting principle as a cumulative catch up as of january  as of january  cmslp had approximately million in deferred revenue related to the special servicing fee revenue 
as a result  this amount was recorded in income and is reflected as a cumulative change in accounting principle for the year ended december  the results of operations for the year ended december  reflect the recognition of special servicing fee revenue on a current basis 
as previously discussed  prior to july   cmslp was accounted for using the equity method and  as a result  the impact of the new accounting principle except for the cumulative catch up is reflected in equity in losses income from investments for the six months ended june  and on a consolidated basis for the six months ended december  the proforma net income disclosures on the income statement and proforma eps disclosures in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements related to this change in accounting principle reflect what the company s net income and eps would have been had this new accounting principle been applied to those periods presented 
net income would have been million less for the year ended december  had this new accounting principle not been adopted 
reit status net operating loss for tax purposes reit status 
criimi mae is required to meet income  asset  ownership and distribution tests to maintain its reit status 
the company believes that it has satisfied the reit requirements for all years through and including  although there can be no assurance 
there can also be no assurance that criimi mae will maintain its reit status for or subsequent years 
if the company fails to maintain its reit status for any taxable year  it will be taxed as a regular domestic corporation subject to federal and state income tax in the year of disqualification and for at least the four subsequent years 
depending on the amount of any such federal and state income tax  the company may have insufficient funds to pay any such tax and also may be unable to comply with its obligations under the new debt 
the company and two of its subsidiaries incorporated in have jointly elected to treat such two subsidiaries as trss effective january  the trss allow the company to earn non qualifying reit income while maintaining reit status 
for tax and other reasons  a reorganization of cmslp was effected such that the partnership interests of cmslp are held by these two subsidiaries 
the company s and net operating loss for tax purposes shareholder rights plan during and  the company traded in both short and longer duration fixed income securities  including non investment grade and investment grade cmbs and investment grade residential mortgage backed securities such securities traded and all other securities of the type described constituting the trading assets to the extent owned by criimi mae inc or any qualified reit subsidiary  meaning generally any wholly owned subsidiary that is not a taxable reit subsidiary  which  for financial reporting purposes  are classified as subordinated cmbs and other mbs on the balance sheet 
the company seeks maximum total return through short term trading  consistent with prudent investment management 
returns from such activities include capital appreciation depreciation resulting from changes in interest rates and spreads  if any  and other arbitrage opportunities 
internal revenue service revenue procedure provides securities and commodities traders with the ability to elect mark to market treatment for the tax year and for all future tax years  unless the election is revoked with the consent of the internal revenue service 
on march   criimi mae elected for tax purposes to be classified as a trader in securities effective january  as a result of its trader election  criimi mae recognized a mark to market tax loss in its income tax return on its trading assets on january  of approximately million the january loss 
this loss is not recorded on the gaap financial statements 
such loss is expected to be recognized evenly for tax purposes over four years beginning with the year ie  approximately million per year 
the company expects such loss to be ordinary 
additionally  as a result of its trader election  the company is required to mark to market its trading assets on a tax basis at the end of each tax year 
any increase or decrease in the value of the trading assets as a result of the year end mark to market requirement will generally result in either a tax gain if an increase in value or a tax loss if a decrease in value 
such tax gains or losses  as well as any realized gains or losses from the disposition of trading assets during each year  are also expected to be ordinary gains or losses 
assets transferred to cbo reit  inc  a reit subsidiary of the company formed as part of the company s reorganization plan  are no longer required to be marked to market on a tax basis since cbo reit is not a trader in securities for tax purposes 
as a result  the mark to market of such assets ceased as of april  since gains and losses associated with trading activities are expected to be ordinary  any gains will generally increase taxable income and any losses will generally decrease taxable income 
since the company is a reit which is generally required to distribute of its taxable income to shareholders for years ending on or before december  and is generally required to distribute for years beginning after  any increases in taxable income from trading activities will generally result in an increase in reit distribution requirements and any decreases in taxable income from trading activities will generally result in a decrease in reit distribution requirements or  if taxable income is reduced to zero because of a net operating loss or loss carryforward  eliminate reit distribution requirements 
gains and losses from the mark to market requirement including the january loss are unrealized 
this creates a mismatch between reit distribution requirements and cash flow since the reit distribution requirements will generally fluctuate due to the mark to market adjustments  but the cash flow from the company s trading assets will not fluctuate as a result of the mark to market adjustments 
the company generated a net operating loss for tax purposes of approximately million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
as such  the company s taxable income was reduced to zero and  accordingly  the company s reit distribution requirements were eliminated for and as of december  the company s accumulated and unused net operating loss nol was million  as further discussed below 
any accumulated and unused net operating losses  subject to certain limitations  generally may be carried forward for up to years to offset taxable income until fully utilized 
accumulated and unused net operating losses cannot be carried back because criimi mae is a reit 
if a trading asset is marked down because of an increase in interest rates  rather than from credit losses  such mark to market losses may be recovered over time through taxable income 
any recovered mark to market losses will generally be recognized as taxable income  although there is expected to be no corresponding increase in cash flow 
there is no assurance that the company s position with respect to its election as a trader in securities will not be challenged by the irs  and  if challenged  will be defended successfully by the company 
as such  there is a risk that the january loss will be limited or disallowed  resulting in higher tax basis income and a corresponding increase in reit distribution requirements 
it is possible that the amount of any under distribution for a taxable year could be corrected with a deficiency dividend as defined in section of the internal revenue code  however  interest may also be due to the internal revenue service on the amount of this under distribution 
if criimi mae is required to make taxable income distributions to its shareholders to satisfy required reit distributions  all or a substantial portion of these distributions  if any  are currently expected to be in the form of non cash dividends 
there is no assurance that such non cash dividends would satisfy the reit distribution requirements and  as such  the company could lose its reit status or may not be able to satisfy its obligations under the operative documents evidencing the new debt 
the company s future use of nols for tax purposes could be substantially limited in the event of an ownership change as defined under section of the internal revenue code 
as a result of these limitations imposed by section of the internal revenue code  in the event of an ownership change  the company s ability to use its nol carryforwards in future years may be limited and  to the extent the nol carryforwards cannot be fully utilized under these limitations within the carryforward periods  the nol carry forwards would expire unutilized 
accordingly  after any ownership change  the company s ability to use its nols to reduce or offset taxable income would be substantially limited or not available under section in general  a company reaches the ownership change threshold if the shareholders increase their aggregate ownership interest in the company over a three year testing period by more than percentage points 
the ownership interest is measured in terms of total market value of the company s capital stock 
the company is not aware of any acquisition of shares of the company s capital stock that has created an ownership change under section  but believes that it may be close to approaching the threshold for an ownership change under section the company is concerned that future acquisitions of common stock  preferred stock or a combination of both by an existing shareholder or a new shareholder could cause an ownership change 
if an ownership change occurs  the company s ability to use its nols to reduce or offset its taxable income would be substantially limited or not available under section of the internal revenue code on a prospective basis 
this would mean the company would have reit distribution requirements based upon its taxable income 
as stated above  any such distributions are expected to be in the form of non cash taxable dividends 
if an ownership change occurs under section of the internal revenue code  the company s prospective use of its accumulated nol and the remaining january loss of a combined total amount of approximately million as of december  will be limited 
if the company had lost its ability to use its accumulated nol as of january   the company s taxable income would have been million 
this increase in taxable income would have created a percent distribution requirement 
if the company was unable to distribute the taxable income to its shareholders  it would have been subject to corporate federal and state income taxes of up to approximately million in currently  the company does not know of any acquisition of shares of its capital stock that would create an ownership change under section of the internal revenue code 
the company has adopted a shareholder rights plan to deter an ownership change within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code  however there can be no assurance that an ownership change will not occur 
see market for the registrant s common stock and related stockholder matters for a discussion of a recently adopted shareholder rights plan 
net operating loss for tax purposes 
criimi mae generated a net operating loss for tax purposes of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to a net operating loss of approximately million in as previously discussed  as a result of its trader election in early  criimi mae recognized a mark to market tax loss of approximately million on certain trading assets on january  the january loss is expected to be recognized evenly over four years    and for tax purposes ie  approximately million per year beginning with the year a summary of the company s and net operating losses for tax purposes is as follows january loss million million less portion recognized in million million less portion recognized in million balance remaining of january loss to be recognized in future periods million million taxable income for the year before recognition of january loss million million less january loss recognized million million plus mark to market unrealized loss gain on trading assets million million net operating loss for the year ended december million million accumulated net operating loss through december million million net operating loss utilization million million net operating loss carried forward for use in future periods million million taxable income for the year ended december  includes an approximate million loss on certain trading assets in connection with the transfer of certain trading assets on april  to cbo reit  inc following the reorganization effected to facilitate the collateral structure for the new debt 
assets transferred to cbo reit  inc are no longer required to be marked to market on a tax basis 
results of operations versus for the year ended december   the company reported a net loss for consolidated financial statement purposes of approximately million as compared to a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  on a basic and diluted per share basis  the financial statement loss increased to per share for from per share for the primary factors resulting in the net loss for the year ended december  were the recognition of a non cash accounting charge of million related to the impairment of retained cmbs  the recognition of a net loss of approximately million related to the sale of the company s interest in cmo iv  and the recognition of approximately million of impairment related to certain sold cmbs  as discussed further below 
despite the recognition of million in impairment and the loss of million on the sale of certain cmbs during  the impact on book equity of these two events was not material since the company had accounted for these assets at fair value with the related fair value adjustment to the cost basis of the bonds already reflected in equity 
the segment discussion pertaining to the mortgage servicing cmslp segment is reflected below in equity in earnings losses from investments 
interest income subordinated cmbs income from subordinated cmbs decreased by approximately million  or  to million during as compared to million during this overall decrease in interest income was primarily the result of the sale of certain cmbs the morgan bonds in february  the first union bonds in april  the chase bonds in august  and the dlj and citicorp bonds in november this decrease in interest income was partially offset by the following factors the impairment on certain cmbs resulting in an increase in the subsequent income yields due to a lower cost basis  and an increase in income yields on cmbs due to a change in methodology in determining such yields 
other than temporary impairment was recognized as of december  on the subordinated cmbs that were sold in as part of the cmbs sale under the reorganization plan 
the impairment resulted in the cmbs cost basis being written down to fair value as of december  as a result of this new basis  these cmbs had revised higher yields effective the first quarter of these higher yields resulted in more income being recognized for financial statement purposes 
further  yields on cmbs increased effective april  due to a change in the allocation and timing of loss estimates as discussed further below  which resulted in additional income recognized during the last nine months of the weighted average yield used to recognize income from april  to december  was and as of december  as previously discussed  effective april   the company changed the allocation and timing of the estimated future credit losses related to the mortgage loans underlying the cmbs 
as a result of the strong us economy  the performance of the mortgage loans underlying the cmbs had been better than management had originally anticipated  and credit losses were lower than originally estimated 
therefore  the company revised its estimated credit losses to occur later in the weighted average life of the cmbs than originally projected 
however  at that time  the company did not lower the total amount of estimated future credit losses related to the mortgage loans underlying the cmbs 
the change in allocation and timing of estimated future credit losses to reflect a later occurrence of such losses resulted in increases in projected cash flow primarily in the form of interest income as of april   which in turn resulted in increases in anticipated yields to maturity 
these revised yields were used to recognize interest income from april  through december  as a result of the revised later projected occurrence of credit losses  the yields used to determine cmbs income increased 
through december   the overall impact of this allocation and timing revision resulted in a basis point increase in total cmbs anticipated yields to maturity basis point increase related to the then remaining cmbs subject to the cmbs sale and basis point increase related to the company s retained portfolio 
these yield increases resulted in approximately million in additional cmbs income during the year ended december   compared to income that would have been recognized using prior unrevised yields related to the retained cmbs portfolio 
the us economy began to slow during the later part of accordingly  the company began to see the impact of the slowing us economy through increased defaults in its loan portfolio 
this trend continued during the first quarter of  and as of march   approximately of the underlying loans in the company s cmbs portfolio were in special servicing 
this compared to and as of december  and  respectively  and as of april  when the company revised its yields upward as discussed above 
primarily as a result of the slowing us economy and the resulting increased defaults  and management s expectation of ensuing loan losses thereon  the company recognized an accounting charge of million for impairment in the fourth quarter related to its cmbs portfolio 
this charge through the income statement did not have a material impact on book equity as the company had carried its cmbs assets at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through equity prior to the impairment charge 
interest income insured mortgage securities interest income from insured mortgage securities decreased by approximately million or to million for from million for this decrease was principally due to the prepayment of six mortgage securities held by criimi mae and its wholly owned subsidiaries for net proceeds aggregating approximately million during the year ended these prepayments represented approximately of the total insured mortgage portfolio 
interest income originated loans interest income from originated loans decreased by approximately million or to approximately million for as compared to million for interest income from originated loans was derived from originated loans included in the cmo iv securitization  a securitization of million face value of conduit loans in june the decrease was primarily due to the sale of the company s interest in cmo iv in november  which reduced interest income for versus in addition  the decrease in interest income was due to the prepayment of two originated loans aggregating million during the year ended interest expense total interest expense decreased by approximately million or to approximately million for from approximately million for this decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in interest expense on variable rate secured borrowings  reflecting the repayment of such debt after the sale of certain cmbs and the company s interest in cmo iv during also contributing to the decrease was a decrease in interest expense on the fixed rate debt related to the insured securities and on the fixed rate debt issued in the cmo iv securitization 
the company sold its interest in cmo iv during the fourth quarter and  as such  no longer recognizes the interest expense on the original securitization 
these decreases were partially offset by the following a discount amortization adjustment of approximately million related to the insured securities fixed rate obligation debt due to an increase in the estimate of future prepayment speeds during the second quarter of this increase in the estimate of future prepayment speeds was a result of these obligations paying down faster than originally anticipated  the replacement during of a portion of the company s variable rate debt with higher fixed rate debt 
the original sales of such fixed rate securities were treated as a financing for accounting purposes 
as such  the company records the securities as liabilities and recognizes the related interest expense on an ongoing basis 
the fixed rate obligations sold typically carry a higher cost than does the variable rate secured borrowing that it replaces  and an increase in variable rate borrowing costs due to higher interest rates in than in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately  or  to million for as compared to million for the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in employment costs from a reduced work force in as compared to  along with a reduction in certain professional costs 
equity in losses earnings from investments equity in losses earnings from investments reflects the activity of certain of the company s equity investments including cmslp and the company s investment in the aim funds 
equity in earnings increased by approximately million during due to equity in earnings of approximately million as compared to equity in losses of million in the equity in losses earnings is primarily comprised of  and million related to cmslp and  and  related to the aim funds in and  respectively 
for the year ended december   cmslp reported net income of approximately  as compared to a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  cmslp total revenues remain relatively unchanged in as compared to  at million for both years 
the total servicing portfolio decreased primarily due to criimi mae s sale of certain cmbs where cmslp previously had the special servicing rights  and because cmslp sold two master servicing contracts during servicing fee income decreased by approximately  or  to million for as compared to million in due to the reduced size of the servicing portfolio 
this reduced income from servicing fees was offset by an increase in assumption fees and other fee income 
cmslp general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million  or  to million during as compared to million in the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an approximate  prepayment loss in cmslp other expenses decreased by approximately million  or  to million in as compared to million in this decrease was attributed to the amortization of purchased mortgage servicing rights 
these assets are amortized in proportion to  and over the period  of the estimated net income servicing revenue in excess of servicing costs from the servicing rights 
amortization expense also reflects the sale of certain servicing rights during other income other income increased by approximately million or to million during as compared to million during this increase was primarily attributable to the timing of temporary investments

net gains on mortgage security and originated loan dispositions during  net gains on mortgage security dispositions were approximately  as a result of six prepayments of mortgage securities held by criimi mae s subsidiaries  or approximately of its portfolio 
during  net gains on mortgage dispositions were approximately million 
for any year  gains or losses on mortgage dispositions are based on the number  carrying amounts and proceeds of mortgages disposed of during the period 
the proceeds realized from the disposition of mortgage assets are based on the net coupon rates of the specific mortgages disposed of in relation to prevailing long term interest rates at the date of disposition 
during  gains on originated loan dispositions were approximately  as a result of two prepayments in the originated loan portfolio 
as previously stated  the company sold all of its interest in the originated loans during late in  there were five prepayments that resulted in gains on originated loan dispositions of approximately  impairment on cmbs as discussed earlier  as of december  the company revised its overall expected loss estimate related to its cmbs portfolio from million to million  over the life of the investment 
in addition  the company expected such revised losses to occur sooner than originally expected because of the slowing us economy 
this revised loss estimate was a result of an increase in the number of loans that were placed in special servicing due primarily to loan defaults 
as of december   million of mortgage loans underlying the company s cmbs portfolio were in special servicing as compared to million as of december  as of march   this amount had grown to million or of the underlying loans in the cmbs portfolio an increase from when the company revised its yields as of april  during and  respectively  the company expected that aggregate losses on the underlying mortgage loans would be approximately million and million in excess of that anticipated when it revised its yields as of april  as the company had determined that the current estimate of expected credit losses exceeded credit losses as previously projected  the company believed its cmbs portfolio had been impaired under sfas as the fair value of the cmbs was million below the amortized cost basis as of december   the company recorded an other than temporary impairment charge through the income statement of million during the fourth quarter of except for the a and bbb rated bonds 
unrealized losses related to these cmbs were previously recognized through other comprehensive income in the equity section of the balance sheet and as a result the impact of the impairment charge is not material to book equity

during and  the company recorded reorganization items due to the chapter filings of criimi mae  cm management and holdings ii  as follows reorganization items short term interest income   professional fees   employee retention program   other   excise tax accrued   subtotal   impairment on cmbs regarding reorganization   net loss on real estate owned  net gain on sale of cmbs  loss on originated loans  total reorganization expense  net   the company recognized impairment on its investment in real estate owned in this asset was sold in july the company recognized impairment on the cmbs subject to the cmbs sale in and additional impairment on the remaining cmbs subject to the cmbs sale in the final bonds subject to the cmbs sale were sold in november impairment on cmbs regarding reorganization 
as discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  under the reorganization plan  a portion of the recapitalization financing resulted from the sale of certain cmbs subject to the cmbs sale  which sale was completed in november the company first filed a plan with the bankruptcy court in the fourth quarter of and during that same quarter criimi mae began marketing for sale the cmbs subject to the cmbs sale 
the company also sold its interest in cmo iv in november as part of the reorganization plan 
as the company decided in the fourth quarter of to sell the cmbs subject to the cmbs sale and it did not expect the value of these bonds to significantly recover before the future sale dates  the company recognized approximately million of other than temporary impairment related to these cmbs  cumulatively  through the third quarter of unrealized losses related to the cmbs subject to the cmbs sale were previously recognized through other comprehensive income in the equity section of the balance sheet 
the other than temporary impairment loss on cmbs is a reorganization item on the income statement as the impairment was recognized as part of the reorganization plan 
extraordinary item gain on debt extinguishment as previously discussed  the company s interest in cmo iv was sold in in accordance with eitf debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments  the net loss on the sale of the company s interest in cmo iv is required to be presented as two components consisting of the loss on the sale of the originated loans and the subsequent gain related to the extinguishment of debt 
because the company decided in the third quarter of to sell all of its interest in cmo iv  the investment in originated loans was adjusted from amortized cost to fair value resulting in a million loss in the third quarter which was classified as a reorganization item 
the gain related to the extinguishment of debt was approximately million and was recognized in november as an extraordinary item 
therefore  the net loss related to the sale of the company s interest in cmo iv was approximately million 
net operating loss for tax purposes versus criimi mae realized a net operating loss for tax purposes of approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to net income of approximately million in see also reit status net operating loss for tax purposes 
cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities increased for as compared to the increase was primarily due to a decrease in restricted cash and cash equivalents and a decrease in receivables and other assets  partially offset by a decrease in payables and accrued expenses 
receivables decreased primarily as a result of the receipt in january of funds withheld related to the company s interest in cmo iv 
the decrease in restricted cash and cash equivalents and the decrease in payables and accrued expenses were primarily caused by cash outflows on the effective date  including approximately million to payoff accrued interest on debt incurred prior to the chapter filing  million to pay an emergence financing origination fee related to a portion of the new debt and million to pay accrued payables related to the chapter filing 
the foregoing payoffs of accrued interest and accrued expenses are included within the net decrease increase in payables and accrued expenses line on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
net cash provided by investing activities decreased for as compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to net proceeds of million received from the sale of cmbs during as part of the company s reorganization plan  as compared to no sales of cmbs during this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the proceeds from insured mortgage securities dispositions during as compared to net cash used in financing activities increased for as compared to the increase in cash used in was primarily attributable to an outflow of cash of approximately million on the effective date  which was used to payoff a portion of the aggregate principal relating to debt incurred prior to the chapter filing 
included in criimi mae s net operating cash flows for the three months ended september  and three months ended december  the first two full fiscal quarters since emerging from chapter are the following items in millions three months three months ended ended net operating cash flows cmbs cash inflows bb through unrated other cash  net interest expense paid on variable rate secured borrowing interest expense paid on series a senior secured notes interest expense accrued for series b senior secured notes semi annual payment general and administrative expenses net operating cash flows during third and fourth quarters principal payments on new debt variable rate secured borrowing series a senior secured notes total principal payments on new debt during third and fourth quarters reo cash inflow outflow  net virtually all cash flows relating to existing assets are  and are currently expected to be  used to satisfy principal  interest and fee obligations under the new debt  and to pay general and administrative and other operating expenses of the company 
therefore  although the company continues to pay down its new debt obligations  the utilization of cash flows for debt service and operating expenses currently results in virtually no remaining net cash flow available for other activities 
the cmbs cash inflows include one time recoveries of prior interest shortfalls related to certain underlying defaulted mortgage loans 
the company believes total cmbs cash inflows will decline in due primarily to the increase in appraisal reduction amounts on properties underlying the cmbs  and realized losses on cmbs 
for the three months ended december   the company paid million in principal payments on the variable rate secured borrowing  which is in excess of the minimum principal requirement of million based upon a year amortization schedule for the same three month period 
the company expects to pay approximately million in to service the mortgage debt on its reo and to fund capital improvements  because the reo is not projected to generate sufficient operating income in to service its mortgage debt or fund its capital improvements 
versus net cash provided by operating activities decreased in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to an increase in restricted cash as compared to  representing cash that was restricted due to stipulations entered into in connection with the chapter proceedings or due to agreements that required certain cmbs interest income payments and or cmbs sale proceeds to be held in segregated accounts  and an increase in non cash interest income related to discount amortization 
net cash provided by investing activities decreased for as compared to primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from mortgage securities dispositions and originated loan dispositions 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale of cmbs and the sale of the company s interest in cmo iv  net of associated debt 
net cash used in financing activities decreased in as compared to due to a decrease in principal payments on debt obligations

the terms of the new debt significantly restrict the amount of cash dividends that can be paid to shareholders 
one such restriction provides that any cash dividends required to maintain reit status assuming the company has the cash to make such distributions and that it is permitted to make such distributions under the terms of the new debt would be paid first to holders of certain of the new debt who convert their secured notes into one or two new series of preferred stock  which new series of preferred stock would be senior to all other series of preferred stock of the company  in the form of redemption payments 
another such restriction provides that if realized losses as defined in the new debt documents  and including appraisal reduction amounts on properties underlying the cmbs collateral on cmbs exceed certain thresholds  then the company is prohibited from paying cash dividends or making other cash distributions or payments to its shareholders  except as required to maintain reit status  with any such cash distributions to be paid in accordance with the terms set forth in the preceding sentence 
as of december   the company had exceeded the loss threshold amounts under the applicable operative documents evidencing the new debt 
exceeding such loss threshold amounts has also resulted in restrictions on the acquisition of cmbs rated b or lower or unrated 
additional restrictions include restrictions on the use of proceeds from equity investments in the company and specified cash flows from certain assets acquired after the effective date 
the restrictions implemented as a result of exceeding the loss threshold amounts cease to apply after realized losses no longer exceed the loss threshold amounts under the applicable operative documents evidencing the new debt

there can be no assurance that targeted levels of cash flow will actually be achieved  that reductions in reit distribution requirements will be realized  or that  if required  new capital will be available to the company

such sale occurred march  since the company retained call options on certain sold bonds the a  bbb and bbb bonds  the company did not surrender control of these assets pursuant to the requirements of fas and thus these securities are accounted for as a financing and not a sale 
since the transaction is recorded as a partial financing and a partial sale  criimi mae has retained the securities with call options in its subordinated cmbs portfolio reflected on its balance sheet 
amortized cost reflects approximately million of impairment charges related to certain cmbs the cbo b and unrated bonds and the cbo bb through unrated bonds which were recognized in the fourth quarter of and approximately million of impairment charges related to certain cmbs the cbo b and unrated bonds and the nomura unrated bond which were recognized in the third quarter of  in addition to the losses discussed in below

in addition  the company expected such revised losses to occur sooner than originally expected because of the slowing us economy and recession 
this revised loss estimate was a result of an increase in the number of loans that were placed in special servicing due primarily to monetary loan defaults 
as of december   million in mortgage loans underlying the company s cmbs portfolio were in special servicing 
as of march   this amount had grown to million  or of the mortgage loans underlying the cmbs portfolio  an increase from when the company revised its yields as of april  see notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the subordinated cmbs for tax purposes

the subordinated healthcare senior housing cmbs are not owned by and are subordinate to criimi mae s cmbs 
as a result  criimi mae s investment in such underlying cmbs will only be affected if interest shortfalls and or realized losses on such healthcare and senior housing mortgage loans are in excess of the subordinated healthcare senior housing cmbs 
as of february   the company reviewed the loans currently under surveillance by the healthcare and senior housing mortgage loans servicer 
based on its review  the company does not believe that the aggregate remaining shortfalls and or realized losses on such healthcare and senior housing mortgage loans currently in special servicing is greater than the current outstanding subordinated healthcare senior housing cmbs 
as a result  the company s current estimate of future credit losses as of december  does not include any provision for shortfalls and or realized losses arising from the healthcare and senior housing mortgage loans in this cmbs transaction 
it should be noted that changes in the future performance of the healthcare and senior housing mortgage loans that result in greater shortfalls and or losses may result in future losses and or possible impairment to criimi mae s cmbs

a special servicer typically provides asset management and resolution services with respect to nonperforming or underperforming loans within a pool of mortgage loans 
when serving as special servicer of a mortgage loan pool  cmslp has the authority  subject to certain restrictions in the cmbs pool documents  to deal directly with any borrower that fails to perform under certain terms of its mortgage loan  including the failure to make payments  and to manage any loan workouts and foreclosures 
as special servicer  cmslp earns fee income on services provided in connection with any loan servicing function transferred to it from the master servicer

as of february   specially serviced loans totaled million 
during the period september  the date the company last revised the loss estimates through february   there was a million  or  increase in specially serviced loans due to additional defaults on underlying mortgage loans secured by a variety of property types  but primarily hotel properties 
the properties that secure these loans have been adversely impacted by a variety of factors  including the economic slowdown and recession which  especially for hotel properties  has been exacerbated by the terrorist attacks of september  of the monetary defaults on the mortgage loans underlying the company s cmbs which transferred into special servicing between september  and february   an approximate million  or  are loans secured by hotel properties 
during this same period  approximately million of loans in special servicing due to monetary default and real estate owned transferred out of special servicing due to correction  dispositions or sale  resulting in a total special servicing portfolio of million as of february   of which million reflect monetary defaults and real estate owned 
of the transfers into special servicing due to monetary default from september  through february   million were comprised of six different borrowing relationships more fully described as follows o hotel loans totaling million spread across three cmbs transactions 
in one of these cmbs transactions  which contains loans totaling million  the company holds only a ownership interest in the non rated class 
the loans were transferred into special servicing due to the bankruptcy filing of each special purpose borrowing entity and their parent company in december the parent company was able to obtain debtor in possession financing that is expected to pay post petition interest on million of these loans through december the remaining million of loans were deemed by the borrower to be highly leveraged  and therefore  not able to support additional debt 
interest will not be paid current on these loans 
o ten loans totaling million spread across two cmbs transactions secured by hotel properties in the pacific west and northwest states 
these loans are past due for the october payment 
the borrower has indicated that the properties have experienced reduced operating performance due to new competition  the economic recession  and reduced travel resulting from the september  terrorist attacks

the loans were transferred to special servicing in december for imminent payment default 
since that time  the borrower has made a payment and the loans are now due for the february payment 
o eight loans totaling million secured by free standing retail stores in maryland and virginia 
each property is occupied by a national retailer 
the loans are past due for the december payment 
cmslp has entered into a workout with the borrower whereby rents are being deposited directly into a lockbox 
additional payments are being collected to bring the loans current during for all of its existing and recent transfers to special servicing  including these large borrower relationships  cmslp is pursuing remedies available to it in order to maximize the recovery of the outstanding debt 
appraisal reductions and losses on cmbs the effect of an appraisal reduction generally is that the servicer stops advancing interest payments on the amount by which the aggregate of debt  advances and other expenses exceeds the appraisal amount  thus reducing the cash flows to criimi mae as the holder of the first loss unrated or lowest rated bonds  as if such appraisal reduction was a realized loss 
as an example  assuming a weighted average coupon of  a million appraisal reduction would reduce net cash flows to the company by  on an annual basis 
see also cash flow for additional discussion of the effect of appraisal reductions on cash flows 
an appraisal reduction may result in a higher or lower realized loss based on the ultimate disposition or work out of the mortgage loan 
appraisal reductions for the cmbs transactions in which the company retains an ownership interest as reported by the underlying trustees or as calculated by cmslp were as follows cbo cbo nomura total year year    year     cumulative appraisal reductions through december  a     not all underlying cmbs transactions require the calculation of an appraisal reduction  however  where cmslp obtains a third party appraisal  it calculates one 
a during the period january  through february   there were an additional million of appraisal reductions 
the company s unrated bonds issuer s equity from cbo  cbo and nomura are expected to experience principal write downs

critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes its most critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy being one that is both very important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments include the determination of fair value of the company s subordinated cmbs and interest income recognition related to the subordinated cmbs 
o fair value of subordinated cmbs due to the limited liquidity of the subordinated cmbs market and the resulting lack of a secondary market  the company estimates the values of its subordinated cmbs internally 
these estimates require significant judgment regarding assumptions for defaults on the underlying commercial mortgage loan collateral  resultant loss severity and discount rates 
note to notes to consolidated financial statements contains a detailed discussion of the methodology used to determine the fair value of the company s subordinated cmbs as well as a sensitivity analysis related to the fair value of these subordinated cmbs due to changes in assumptions related to losses on the underlying commercial mortgage loan collateral and discount rates 
o interest income recognition related to subordinated cmbs interest income recognition under eitf requires the company to make estimates regarding expected prepayment speeds as well as expected losses on the underlying commercial mortgage loan collateral which directly impact the cash flows on the company s subordinated cmbs in the form of interest shortfalls and loss of principal and the impact these factors would have on future cash flow 
note to notes to consolidated financial statements details the expected realized losses by year the company expects to incur related to its subordinated cmbs 
the cash flows the company projects to arrive at the effective interest rate to recognize interest income are adjusted for these expected losses 
the judgment regarding future expected credit losses is subjective as credit performance is particular to an individual deal s specific underlying commercial mortgage loan collateral 
in general  if the company increases its expected losses or determines such losses will occur sooner than previously projected and the cmbs s fair value is below cost  then the cmbs will be considered impaired and adjusted to fair value with the impairment charge recorded through earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates related to the us treasury market as well as the libor market 
the company will have fluctuations in the amount of interest expense paid on its variable rate secured borrowing primarily due to changes in one month libor 
the company will also experience fluctuations in the market value of its assets related to changes in the interest rates of us treasury bonds as well as changes in the spread between us treasury bonds and cmbs

the cap provides protection to criimi mae to the extent the one month libor rate increases above the stated interest rate cap  in which case  criimi mae will receive payments based on the difference between the one month libor rate and the cap rate 
the term of the cap as well as the stated interest rate of the cap  which is currently above the current one month libor rate  will limit the amount of protection that the cap offers

if the company fails to make any one of these payments  the interest rate on the unpaid principal amount would increase by basis points if certain miscellaneous collateral is not sold or otherwise disposed of by the noteholders
