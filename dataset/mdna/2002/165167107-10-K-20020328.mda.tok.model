for the year ended december   chesapeake had net income of million  or per diluted common share  on total revenues of million 
this compares to net income of million  or per diluted common share  on total revenues of million during the year ended december   and net income of million  or per diluted common share  on total revenues of million during the year ended december  the net income included  on a pre tax basis except for the extraordinary item  million in risk management income  a million impairment of certain equity investments  a million gain on the sale of our canadian subsidiary  a million cost for an unsecured standby credit facility associated with the acquisition of gothic energy corporation  and a million extraordinary after tax loss on early extinguishment of debt 
net income in was significantly enhanced by the reversal of a deferred tax valuation allowance in the amount of million during the fourth quarter 
the reversal related to chesapeake s expected ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize net operating losses prior to their expiration 
oil and gas sales 
during  oil and gas sales increased to million versus million in and million in in  chesapeake produced bcfe at a weighted average price of per mcfe  compared to bcfe produced in at a weighted average price of per mcfe  and bcfe produced in at a weighted average price of per mcfe 
the following table shows our production by region for  and years ended december  mmcfe percent mmcfe percent mmcfe percent mid continent    gulf coast    canada    permian basin    williston basin and other    total production    natural gas production represented approximately of our total production volume on an equivalent basis in  compared to in and in the decrease in oil production from through is the result of divestitures that occurred primarily in and our increasing focus on natural gas 
for  we realized an average price per barrel of oil of  compared to in and in natural gas prices per mcf were  and in  and  respectively 
our hedging activities resulted in an increase in oil and gas revenues of million or per mcfe in  a decrease of million or per mcfe in  and a decrease of million or per mcfe in effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception of a derivative 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results of the hedged item in the consolidated statement of operations 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness  as defined by sfas  is recognized immediately in earnings 
changes in fair value of contracts that do not meet the sfas definition of a cash flow hedge are also recognized in earnings through risk management income 
risk management income 
chesapeake recognized million of risk management income in  compared to no such income loss in and risk management income for consisted of million related to changes in fair value of derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges less million of reclassifications related to the settlement of such contracts plus million associated with the ineffective portion of derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting 
pursuant to sfas  our cap swaps do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges 
therefore  changes in fair value of these instruments that occur prior to their maturity  together with any change in fair value of cash flow hedges resulting from ineffectiveness  are reported in the statement of operations as risk management income loss 
amounts recorded in risk management income loss do not represent cash gains or losses 
rather  these amounts are temporary valuation swings in contracts or portions of contracts that are not entitled to receive hedge accounting treatment 
all amounts initially recorded in this caption are ultimately reversed within this same caption and included in oil and gas sales over the respective contract terms 
oil and gas marketing sales 
chesapeake realized million in oil and gas marketing sales for third parties in  with corresponding oil and gas marketing expenses of million  for a net margin of million 
this compares to sales of million and million  expenses of million and million  and margins of million and million in and  respectively 
in  chesapeake realized an increase in volumes related to oil and gas marketing sales  which was partially offset by a decrease in oil and gas prices 
the increase in marketing sales and cost of sales in as compared to was due primarily to higher oil and gas prices in and the fact that we began marketing oil in june production expenses 
production expenses  which include lifting costs and ad valorem taxes  were million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
on a unit of production basis  production expenses were per mcfe in compared to and per mcfe in and  respectively 
the increase in costs on a per unit basis in is due primarily to increased field service costs  higher production costs associated with properties acquired in and an increase in ad valorem taxes 
we expect that lease operating expenses per mcfe in will range from to 
production taxes 
production taxes were million in compared to million in and million in on a unit of production basis  production taxes were  and per mcfe in  and  respectively 
the increase in of million was due to an increase in production volumes and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the average wellhead prices received for natural gas in the increase from to was the result of increased prices 
in general  production taxes are calculated using value based formulas that produce higher per unit costs when oil and gas prices are higher 
we expect production taxes per mcfe to range from to in based on our assumption that oil and natural gas wellhead prices will range from to per mcfe 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses  which are net of internal payroll and non payroll costs capitalized in our oil and gas properties see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  were million in  million in and million in the increase in is the result of the company s growth related to the various acquisitions which occurred in late and during chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
we capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
we capitalized million  million and million of internal costs in  and  respectively  directly related to our oil and gas exploration and development efforts 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses for will be between and per mcfe  which is approximately the same level as oil and gas depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties was million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the average dd a rate per mcfe  which is a function of capitalized costs  future development costs  and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented  was in us and in canada  in us and in canada and in us and in canada in  and  respectively 
we expect the dd a rate to be between and per mcfe 
depreciation and amortization of other assets 
depreciation and amortization of other assets was million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in was primarily the result of higher depreciation cost on fixed assets related to recent capital expenditures 
other property and equipment costs are depreciated on both straight line and accelerated methods 
buildings are depreciated on a straight line basis over years 
drilling rigs are depreciated on a straight line basis over years 
all other property and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from five to seven years 
interest and other income 
interest and other income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in was the result of a decrease in miscellaneous non oil and gas income offset by an increase in interest income 
the decrease in was due primarily to gains on sales of various non oil and gas assets during which did not occur in interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in is due to a million increase in average long term borrowings in compared to  partially offset by a decrease in the overall average interest rate 
the increase in compared to was due to additional borrowings under our bank credit facility 
in addition to the interest expense reported  we capitalized million of interest during  compared to million capitalized in  and million capitalized in on significant investments in unproved properties that were not being currently depreciated  depleted or amortized and on which exploration activities were in progress 
interest is capitalized using the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings 
we anticipate that capitalized interest for will be between million and million 
impairments of investments in securities 
during we recorded impairments to two equity investments of million 
the majority of this impairment was related to our investment in ram energy  inc in march  we issued million shares of chesapeake common stock in exchange for of ram s outstanding common stock 
our shares were valued at each  or million in total 
during  we recorded our equity in ram s net losses  which had the effect of reducing our carrying value in these securities to million 
in december  we sold the ram shares for minimal consideration 
in addition  we reduced the carrying value of our million investment in an internet based oil and gas business by million to million 
gain on sale of canadian subsidiary 
in october  we sold our canadian subsidiary  which had oil and gas operations primarily in northeast british columbia  for approximately million 
under full cost accounting  our investment in these canadian oil and gas properties was treated as a separate cost center for accounting purposes 
as a result of the sale of this cost center  any gain or loss on the disposition is required to be recognized currently in earnings 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a gain on sale of our canadian subsidiary of million 
gothic standby credit facility costs 
during  we obtained a standby commitment for a million credit facility  consisting of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility which  if needed  would have replaced our then existing revolving credit facility 
the term loan was available to provide funds to repurchase any of gothic production corporation s senior secured notes tendered following the closing of the gothic acquisition in january pursuant to a change of control offer to purchase 
in february  we purchased million of notes tendered for of such amount 
we did not use the standby credit facility and the commitment terminated on february  chesapeake incurred million of costs for the standby facility  which were recognized in the first quarter of extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt 
during  we purchased or redeemed million principal amount of our senior notes  million principal amount of the senior secured notes of gothic production corporation  a chesapeake subsidiary  and all million principal amount of our senior notes 
the purchase and redemption of these notes included payment of aggregate make whole and redemption premiums of million and the write off of unamortized debt costs and debt issue premiums 
these costs associated with early extinguishment of debt are reflected as a million after tax extraordinary loss in provision benefit for income taxes 
chesapeake recorded income tax expense of million in  compared to income tax benefit of million in and income tax expense of million in income tax expense for is comprised of million related to our domestic operations  million related to our canadian operations and million related to the sale of our canadian subsidiary 
the income tax benefit in was comprised of million of income tax expense related to our canadian operations and the reversal of a million deferred tax valuation allowance which was established in prior years 
the valuation allowance had been established due to uncertainty surrounding our ability to utilize extensive regular tax nols prior to their expiration 
based upon our results of operations as of december   the improved outlook for the natural gas industry and our projected results of future operations  we believed it was more likely than not that chesapeake would be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize our existing nols prior to their expiration 
consequently  we determined that a valuation allowance was no longer required at december  our expectations remain unchanged as of december  the income tax expense recorded in was related entirely to our canadian operations 
cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities cash flows from operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities exclusive of changes in working capital was million in  compared to million in and million in the million increase from to was primarily due to increased oil and gas revenues resulting from higher sales volume and higher prices 
the million increase from to was primarily due to increased oil and gas revenues resulting from higher prices 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash used in investing activities increased to million in  compared to million in and million in during  chesapeake invested million for exploration and development drilling  invested million for the acquisition of oil and gas properties  received million related to divestitures of oil and gas properties and received million for the sale of our canadian subsidiary 
in  we invested million in securities of other companies  including million in notes and warrants of seven seas petroleum inc  million in notes of ram energy  inc 
and million in other equity securities 
we also invested million in drilling rig equipment  million in our oklahoma city office complex and million on upgrading various other properties and equipment 
during  chesapeake invested million for exploration and development drilling  invested million for the acquisition of oil and gas properties  and received million related to divestitures of oil and gas properties 
we invested million in connection with our acquisition of gothic energy corporation  including the purchase of gothic notes and acquisition related costs 
we also invested million in drilling rig equipment 
additionally in  we invested million in our oklahoma city office complex 
in  we invested million for exploration and development drilling  invested million for the acquisition of oil and gas properties  and received million related to divestitures of oil and gas properties 
cash flows from financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to million used in and million provided in during  we borrowed million under our bank credit facility and made repayments under this facility of million 
in  we received million from the issuance of our million senior notes in april and million from the issuance of our million senior notes in november 
we used million to purchase or redeem various chesapeake and gothic senior notes 
we incurred million of deferred charges related to our credit facility 
in november  we issued million in preferred stock and received million of net proceeds 
we received million from the exercise of employee and director stock options 
we paid million for make whole provisions in the fourth quarter related to the exchange of our common stock for ram energy  inc common stock which occurred in march preferred stock dividends of million were paid in during  we borrowed million under our bank credit facility and made repayments under this facility of million 
also in  we paid million in connection with exchanges of our preferred stock for our common stock and paid cash dividends of million on our preferred stock 
in connection with our purchase of gothic notes in  we received million cash from the sellers of gothic notes pursuant to make whole provisions included in the purchase agreements 
these provisions required payments to be made by the sellers to us  or additional payments to be made by us to the sellers  depending upon changes in market value of our common stock during a specified period pending registration of our common stock issued to the sellers of gothic notes 
during  we borrowed million under our bank credit facility and made repayments under this facility of million 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity chesapeake had working capital of million at december   of which million was cash 
another source of liquidity is our million revolving bank credit facility with a committed borrowing base of million which matures in september we believe we will have adequate resources  including budgeted operating cash flows  working capital and proceeds from our revolving bank credit facility  to fund our capital expenditure budget for exploration and development activities during  which is currently estimated to be approximately million 
however  higher drilling and field operating costs  unfavorable drilling results or other factors could cause us to reduce our drilling program  which is largely discretionary 
based on our current cash flow assumptions  we expect operating cash flow to be between million and million 
any operating cash flow not needed to fund our drilling program will be available for acquisitions  debt repayment or other general corporate purposes in a significant portion of our liquidity is concentrated in cash and cash equivalents  including restricted cash  and derivative instruments that enable us to hedge a portion of our exposure to price volatility from producing oil and natural gas 
these arrangements expose us to credit risk from our counterparties 
our mark to market position and closed but uncollected receivable with our largest counterparty  morgan stanley capital group inc  totaled million at december  we do not expect that morgan stanley or our other counterparties will fail to meet their obligations given their high credit ratings 
other financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments and accounts receivables 
our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers of oil and natural gas products and exploration and production companies which own interests in properties we operate 
the industry concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that our customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic  industry or other conditions 
we generally require letters of credit for receivables from customers which are judged to have sub standard credit  unless the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated 
cash and cash equivalents are deposited with major banks or institutions with high credit ratings 
our liquidity is not dependent on the use of off balance sheet financing arrangements  such as the securitization of receivables or obtaining access to assets through special purpose entities 
we have not relied on off balance sheet financing arrangements in the past and we do not intend to rely on such arrangements in the future as a source of liquidity 
we are not a commercial paper issuer 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we have a million revolving bank credit facility with a committed borrowing base of million which matures in september as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility and had million of the facility securing various letters of credit 
borrowings under the facility are collateralized by certain producing oil and gas properties and bear interest at either the reference rate of union bank of california  na  or london interbank offered rate libor  at our option  plus a margin that varies according to total facility usage 
the collateral value and borrowing base are redetermined periodically 
the unused portion of the facility is subject to an annual commitment fee of 
interest is payable quarterly 
the credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions including incurring additional indebtedness  selling properties  paying dividends  purchasing or redeeming our capital stock  making investments or loans or purchasing certain of our senior notes  creating liens  and making acquisitions 
the credit facility agreement requires us to maintain a current ratio of at least to and a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to if we should fail to perform our obligations under these and other covenants  the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable 
such acceleration  if involving a principal amount of million or more  would constitute an event of default under our senior note indentures  which could in turn result in the acceleration of our senior note indebtedness 
the credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness we may have with an outstanding principal amount in excess of million 
as of december   senior notes represented billion of our long term debt and consisted of the following million principal amount of senior notes due  million principal amount of senior notes due  million principal amount of senior notes due and million principal amount of senior notes due there are no scheduled principal payments required on any of the senior notes until march  when million is due  as a result of the repurchase and retirement of million of our senior notes in march debt ratings for the senior notes are b by moody s investor service  b by standard poor s ratings services and bb by fitch ratings as of december  debt ratings for our secured bank credit facility are ba by moody s investor service  bb by standard poor s ratings services and bb by fitch ratings 
our senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of chesapeake and rank equally with all of our other unsecured indebtedness 
all of our wholly owned subsidiaries except chesapeake energy marketing  inc guarantee the notes 
the senior notes are redeemable at our option at any time prior to march  at the make whole price determined in accordance with the indenture 
on or after march   we may redeem the senior notes at the redemption price set forth in the indenture 
we may redeem all or some of the senior notes at any time on and after april  at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture and prior to such date pursuant to make whole provisions in the indenture 
we may redeem the senior notes at any time on and after november  at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture and prior to such date pursuant to make whole provisions in the indenture 
if we repurchase at least million of the senior notes by august   we may extend the bank credit facility until june for an amount equal to the total revolving credit facility commitment less the outstanding amount of the senior notes plus million 
the indentures for the and senior notes contain covenants limiting our ability and our restricted subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem  repurchase or retire our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness  make investments and other restricted payments  create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries  incur liens  engage in transactions with affiliates  sell assets  and consolidate  merge or transfer assets 
the debt incurrence covenants do not affect our ability to borrow under or expand our secured credit facility 
as of december   we estimate that secured commercial bank indebtedness of approximately million could have been incurred under the most restrictive indenture covenant 
the indenture covenants do not apply to chesapeake energy marketing  inc  an unrestricted subsidiary 
the table below summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual less than after obligations year years years years total long term debt    capital lease obligations operating leases    unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations 
    amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands total other less than over amounts commercial commitments year years years years committed lines of credit standby letters of credit   guarantees standby repurchase obligations other commercial commitments   total commercial commitments    some of our commodity price risk management arrangements require us to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance to the counterparties in the event that our payment obligations with respect to our commodity price risk management transactions exceed certain levels 
at december   we were not required to post any collateral 
future collateral requirements are uncertain and will depend on arrangements with our counterparties and highly volatile natural gas and oil prices 
investing and financing transactions during we completed the acquisition of gothic energy corporation on january  by merging a wholly owned subsidiary into gothic 
we issued a total of million common shares in the merger 
gothic shareholders other than chesapeake received of a share of chesapeake common stock for each share of gothic common stock

the consideration for this acquisition was million  consisting of million of cash  surrender of million principal amount of our ram notes including million in accrued interest  and cancellation of a million receivable by us from ram 
subsequent to year end  we sold the remaining million principal amount of ram notes  which had a carrying value on our books of million  for million  including accrued interest of million 
on april   we issued million principal amount of senior notes due  all of which were subsequently exchanged for substantially identical notes registered under the securities act of the net proceeds were approximately million

on may   we redeemed all million principal amount of our senior notes  the remaining million principal amount of our senior notes and the remaining million principal amount of gothic production corporation s senior secured notes 
the purchase and redemption of these notes included payment of aggregate make whole and redemption premiums of million and the write off of unamortized debt costs and debt issue premiums 
the costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt were reflected as a million after tax extraordinary loss in the refinancing lowered the interest rate and extended the maturity of approximately of our senior notes outstanding at that time

critical accounting policies readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place 
the three most significant policies are discussed below 
hedging 
from time to time  chesapeake uses commodity price risk management instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations in oil and natural gas and interest rates 
recognized gains and losses on hedge contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction 
results of oil and gas hedging transactions are reflected in oil and gas sales to the extent related to our oil and gas production 
the changes in fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying for designation as cash flow hedges that occur prior to maturity are initially reported in the consolidated statement of operations as risk management income loss 
all amounts initially recorded in this caption are ultimately reversed within the same caption and included in oil and gas sales over the respective contracts terms 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception of a derivative 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results of the hedged item in the consolidated statement of operations 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness  as defined by sfas  is recognized immediately in earnings 
changes in fair value of contracts that do not meet the sfas definition of a cash flow hedge are also recognized in earnings through risk management income 
see hedging activities and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information regarding our hedging activities 
oil and gas properties 
chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
we capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
capitalized costs are amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved oil and gas reserves 
as of december   approximately of our present value discounted at of estimated future net revenues of proved reserves was evaluated by independent petroleum engineers  with the balance evaluated by our internal reservoir engineers 
in addition  our internal engineers reevaluate our reserves on a quarterly basis 
proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in the relationship between costs and the value of proved reserves or the underlying value of unproved properties  in which case a gain or loss is recognized 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated 
we review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties  and otherwise if impairment has occurred 
unevaluated properties are grouped by major producing area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant 
we review the carrying value of our oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the securities and exchange commission on a quarterly basis 
under these rules  capitalized costs  less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes  may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves  less any related income tax effects 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which chesapeake operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as derivative instruments  depreciation  depletion and amortization  and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences and the net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent chesapeake establishes a valuation allowance or increases or decreases this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provisions in the consolidated statement of operations 
hedging activities our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and gas 
to mitigate a portion of this exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into derivative instruments 
all of our derivative instruments have been entered into as hedges of oil and gas price risk and not for speculative purposes 
we utilize derivative instruments to reduce exposure to unfavorable changes in oil and gas prices which are subject to significant and often volatile fluctuations 
as of december   our derivative instruments were comprised of swaps  collars  cap swaps and locked swaps 
these instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective oil and gas prices to be received for our hedged production 
pursuant to sfas  our cap swaps do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges 
therefore  changes in the fair value of these instruments that occur prior to their maturity  together with any changes in fair value of cash flow hedges resulting from ineffectiveness  are reported in the consolidated statement of operations as risk management income loss

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk management activity our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and gas 
to mitigate a portion of this exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into derivative instruments 
all of our derivative instruments have been entered into as hedges of oil and gas price risk and not for speculative purposes 
we utilize derivative instruments to reduce exposure to unfavorable changes in oil and gas prices which are subject to significant and often volatile fluctuations 
as of december   our derivative instruments were comprised of swaps  collars  cap swaps and locked swaps 
these instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective oil and gas prices to be received for our hedged production 
o for swap instruments  we receive a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pay a floating market price  as defined in each instrument  to the counterparty 
the fixed price payment and the floating price payment are netted  resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 
o collars contain a fixed floor price put and ceiling price call 
if the market price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price  then we receive the fixed price and pay the market price 
if the market price is between the call and the put strike price  then no payments are due from either party 
o for cap swaps  we receive a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pay a floating market price 
the fixed price received by chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for a cap on the floating market price  which limits the counterparty s exposure 
o locked swaps consist of swap positions which have been effectively closed by entering into a counter swap instrument where we receive the floating price for the hedged commodity and pay a fixed price to the counterparty 
at the time we enter into the counter swap  the original swap is designated as a non qualifying cash flow hedge under sfas the net values of both the swap and counter swap are frozen and shown as derivatives receivable or payable in the consolidated balance sheet 
pursuant to sfas  our cap swaps do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges 
therefore  changes in the fair value of these instruments that occur prior to their maturity are reported in the statement of operations as risk management income loss 
amounts recorded in risk management income loss do not represent cash gains or losses 
rather  these amounts are temporary valuation swings in contracts or portions of contracts that are not entitled to receive hedge accounting treatment 
all amounts initially recorded in this caption are ultimately reversed within this same caption and included in oil and gas sales over the respective contract terms 
the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments as of december  are provided below 
the associated carrying values of these instruments are equal to the estimated fair values 
december  in thousands derivative assets fixed price gas cap swaps  fixed price gas locked swaps  fixed price gas collars  fixed price gas swaps  fixed price crude oil cap swaps  fixed price crude oil locked swaps  total  we have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates of fair value reported by our counterparties 
the actual contribution to our future results of operations will be based on the market prices at the time of settlement and may be more or less than the fair value estimates used at december  risk management income in the consolidated statement of operations for is comprised of the following in thousands risk management income change in fair value of derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting  reclassification of settled contracts  ineffective portion of derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting  total  although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended 
the change in fair value of our derivative instruments since january  resulted from a decrease in market prices for natural gas and crude oil 
the majority of this change in fair value is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of deferred income tax effects  in the december  consolidated balance sheet 
derivative assets reflected as current in the consolidated balance sheet represent the estimated fair value of derivative instrument settlements scheduled to occur over the subsequent twelve month period based on market prices for oil and gas as of the balance sheet date 
the derivative settlement amounts are not due and payable until the month in which the related underlying hedged transaction occurs 
we expect to transfer approximately million of the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income  based upon the market prices at december   to earnings during the next months when the forecasted transactions actually occur 
all forecasted transactions hedged as of december  are expected to occur by december as of december   we had the following open derivative instruments designed to hedge a portion of our gas production for periods after december swaps cap swaps collars nymex nymex capped index low low high strike strike strike strike strike price price price price price volume per volume per per volume per per mmbtu mmbtu mmbtu mmbtu mmbtu mmbtu mmbtu mmbtu st quarter    nd quarter    rd quarter    th quarter   total    st quarter  nd quarter  rd quarter  th quarter  total  the above table does not include locked swaps of  mmbtu for and  mmbtu for subsequent to december   we settled the gas swaps  gas cap swaps and gas collars for january  february and march gains totaling million will be recognized as price adjustments in the first quarter of and are comprised of million for gas swaps  million for gas cap swaps and million for gas collars 
any associated gains related to cap swaps and the ineffective portion of derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting that were recognized during as risk management income will be reclassified from risk management income to oil and gas sales during as of december   we had the following open derivative instruments designed to hedge a portion of our domestic crude oil production for periods after december cap swaps nymex nymex capped index low strike volume strike price price bbls per bbl per bbl st quarter  nd quarter  rd quarter  th quarter  total  subsequent to december   we settled the oil cap swaps for january and february for gains of million for oil swaps and million for oil cap swaps 
any associated gains related to cap swaps and the ineffectiveness portions of derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting that were recognized during as risk management income will be reclassified from risk management income to oil and gas sales during as of december   we closed certain swap transactions designed to hedge a portion of our domestic oil and natural gas production 
we refer to these transactions as locked swaps 
the net unrecognized gains resulting from these transactions will be recognized as price adjustments in the months of related production 
at december   these amounts are classified as derivative receivables on the consolidated balance sheet 
these hedging gains and losses are set forth below locked swaps hedging gains gas oil total in thousands st quarter    nd quarter    rd quarter   th quarter   total    st quarter   nd quarter   rd quarter   th quarter   total   grand total    interest rate risk the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates

december  years of maturity thereafter total fair value in millions liabilities long term debt  including current portion fixed rate    average interest rate long term debt variable rate average interest rate this amount does not include the discount of million included in long tem debt 
changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we earn on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
at december   we were not using any interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
all of our other long term indebtedness is fixed rate and therefore does not expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates 
however  changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of our debt
