the year other  net has been restated from an originally reported gain of million as gains on sales of terminals owned by holland and reddaway  amounting to million were reclassified into operating income consistent with industry practice 
outlook unknown trends or uncertainties while we believe that the current economic downturn is largely cyclical  we also expect it to continue as least through the first half of we plan to monitor capital spending and cash flow as well as continue strict controls over spending and operating costs 
actual results for will depend upon a number of factors  including the extent and duration of the current economic downturn  our ability to maintain freight rates as competitors increase their pricing pressures  and our ability to increase our market share as we maintain our levels of service and at the same time introduce new service products 
liquidity and capital resources we generated million in cash flows from operating activities during while our net income decreased during compared to  lower revenue resulted in our having lower working capital requirements  and this contributed approximately million to our cash flow from operations 
net cash flows after financing activities was a positive million resulting in our having million in cash and equivalents on hand at the end of capital expenditures during the year amounted to million  of which million was for revenue equipment  million for terminals  million for it and communications equipment  million for other assets  and million to purchase the assets of a former independent contractor of worldwide 
capital expenditures for amounted to million  of which million was for revenue equipment  million was for terminals  million for it and communications gear and million for other assets plus million was paid for the acquisitions of tri star transportation  inc and ultimex global logistics plc

on january   we filed a form s shelf registration statement that allowed for the sale of up to million in additional guaranteed notes of which million is available for issuance as of december  on april   we issued million of unsecured guaranteed notes that are due april  net proceeds from the sale of the notes amounted to million 
we used million of the net proceeds to pay off our notes that matured on may  interest on all of our notes is paid semiannually 
the notes may be redeemed prior to maturity and have no sinking fund requirements 
if the notes are redeemed prior to maturity  the purchase price is the greater of of the principal amount of the guaranteed notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments on such guaranteed notes  discounted to the redemption date  on a semiannual basis at the treasury rate plus basis points  plus accrued interest 
we issued unsecured guaranteed notes of million on may  that are due may  and bear interest at  payable semiannually 
net proceeds from the sale of the notes amounted to million 
the notes may be redeemed prior to maturity and have no sinking fund requirements 
if the notes are redeemed prior to maturity  the purchase price is the greater of of the principal amount of the guaranteed notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments on such guaranteed notes  discounted to the redemption date  on a semiannual basis at the treasury rate plus basis points plus accrued interest 
our guaranteed notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed  jointly and severally  on an unsecured senior basis  by all our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries the subsidiary guarantors 
we are a holding company and during the periods presented substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary guarantors  and substantially all of our operations were conducted by the subsidiary guarantors 
accordingly  the aggregate assets  liabilities  earnings and equity of the subsidiary guarantors were substantially equivalent to the assets  liabilities  earnings and equity shown in our consolidated statements 
we believe that separate financial statements of our subsidiary guarantors  and other disclosures relating to them  are not meaningful or material to our investors 
in addition to our notes mentioned above  we have a million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks 
the facility expires in november and allows up to million for standby letters of credit to cover our self insurance program  and has optional pricing of interest rates  including libor or prime base rates 
the facility has an annual fee and contains customary financial covenants including maintenance of minimum net worth and funded debt to cash flow 
during  all borrowings were drawn at libor base rates  with a weighted average interest rate for the year of  excluding fees charged on the facility 
we have had no borrowings under this facility since april at december  we had annual report no borrowings and had million in outstanding letters of credit under this facility 
we expect to have a similar revolving credit facility in place prior to the current facility s expiration 
in addition to the revolving credit facility  we maintain three uncommitted lines of credit  which provide million of short term funds at rates approximating libor 
these facilities are used with a centralized cash management system to finance our short term working capital needs  which allows us to maintain minimal cash balances 
at december   we had no borrowings under these uncommitted facilities 
we believe cash flows from operating activities and funding from our revolving credit facilities are adequate to finance our anticipated business activity in at december   we had commitments to purchase approximately million in land and improvements  million for transportation equipment and million for other equipment 
during  we repurchased approximately million of our shares under two repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors

 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in july among other provisions in these two statements  all future business combinations will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and use of the pooling of interest method is prohibited 
for acquisitions completed after july   goodwill will not be amortized 
in addition  effective january   previously recorded goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to impairment tests annually 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  as such  goodwill will no longer be amortized beginning in for the year ended december   we recorded goodwill amortization of million 
additionally  at december   we have recorded goodwill of million 
as a result of this new standard  we will be required to record an impairment charge of million at worldwide  our freight forwarding segment  that will be shown as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as of january  usfreightways in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which the obligation is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to our present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
the standard is effective for we are currently reviewing the requirements of this new standard and have not as of yet determined the impact  if any  on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
sfas no 
also revised standards for the reporting of discontinued operations 
the standard is effective for and generally is to be applied prospectively 
although we are currently reviewing the requirements of this new standard  we do not expect that its implementation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
self insurance in the normal course of our operations  we incur claims for cargo loss and damage  bodily injury  property damage and workers compensation 
we are effectively self insured for up to million per occurrence for cargo loss and damage  bodily injury and property damage  and for up to million per occurrence for workers compensation claims 
we obtain customary third party insurance for exposures in excess of these self insured limits 
as of december   we had recorded a total liability of approximately million with respect to these exposures 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our reserves using statistical methods based on historical claims experience to estimate the ultimate value for incidents incurred that may result in claims to us 
while there is a risk the ultimate outcome of these incidents could differ from the reserve recorded  we believe the outcome of these matters is not expected to have any material adverse effect on the financial position or results of our operations 
other litigation and claims we use underground storage tanks at certain terminal facilities and maintain a comprehensive policy of testing  upgrading  replacing and eliminating these tanks to protect the environment and comply with various federal and state laws 
whenever any contamination is detected  we take prompt remedial action to remove the contaminants 
we believe the total costs related to all known incidents have been provided for in our financial statements and we are not aware of any potential contamination incidents that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations
