item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview business conditions the company is principally engaged in the business of designing  manufacturing and marketing graphite carbon fiber based composite golf club shafts  with approximately of its net sales resulting from sales to golf club manufacturers for inclusion in their clubs 
as a result  the company s operating results are substantially dependent not only on demand by its customers for the company s shafts  but also on demand by consumers for clubs including graphite shafts such as the company s 
until recently  graphite shafts were principally offered by manufacturers of higher priced  premium golf clubs  and the company s sales have been predominantly of premium graphite shafts 
however  in recent years the company has realized substantial sales growth in the value priced segment of the graphite shaft market 
the company now competes aggressively with both united states and foreign based shaft manufacturers for premium graphite shafts and also against primarily foreign based shaft manufacturers for lower priced value shaft sales 
the company continues to maintain a broad customer base in the premium shaft market segment 
while the company s market share in the value segment is not as great as the premium segment  the company has advanced rapidly in securing new customers in this segment in recent years 
generally  value shafts have significantly lower selling prices than premium shafts and as a result contribute less to gross profit 
the company s sales have tended to be concentrated among a limited number of major club companies  thus making the company s results of operations dependent on those customers  their continued willingness to purchase a significant portion of their shafts from the company  and their success in selling clubs containing the company s shafts to their customers 
in  net sales to callaway golf  taylormade adidas golf and ping represented  and of the company s net sales  respectively  and the company anticipates that these companies will continue  collectively  to represent the largest portion of its sales in although it is generally difficult to predict in advance the success of any particular club or of any particular manufacturer  the company believes that it is protected to some extent from normal periodic fluctuations in sales among the various golf club companies by virtue of the broad range of its club manufacturer customers 
golf club companies regularly introduce new clubs  frequently containing innovations in design 
sometimes these new clubs achieve dramatic success in the marketplace  thus increasing the overall volatility of club sales among the major companies 
while the company seeks to have its shafts represented on as many major product introductions as possible  it can provide no assurance that its shafts will be included in any particular hot club or that sales of a hot club that does not include the company s shafts will not have a negative impact on the sales of those clubs that do 
the company s sales could also suffer a significant drop off from period to period to the extent that they may be dependent in any period on sales of one or more hot clubs  which then tail off in subsequent periods when no other club offers a high level of new sales to replace the lost sales 
in  the company started manufacturing prepreg  the principal raw material in the manufacture of graphite golf shafts  at its facility in poway  california 
most of its production of prepreg is used internally by the company  with the remainder sold to other composite materials manufacturers 
the company does not expect third party sales of prepreg to have a significant financial impact on the company for at least the next several years 
in  the company established a manufacturing facility in evanston  wyoming for the production of carbon fiber 
during and through the first ten months of  the company used the material from this facility to satisfy a significant portion of its internal demand for carbon fiber in the manufacturing of golf club shafts 
during  the company also produced and sold carbon fiber from this facility to other unrelated entities for the manufacture of other carbon based products 
on october   sgl carbon fibers and composite  inc sgl purchased a interest in the company s carbon fiber manufacturing operation 
the company and sgl entered into an agreement to operate the facility as a limited liability company with equal ownership interests between the venture partners 
the company and sgl also entered into supply agreements with the new entity  carbon fiber technology llc cft  for the purchase of carbon fiber at cost plus an agreed upon mark up 
the company and sgl are each responsible to bear of the fixed costs to operate the facility as a term of this supply agreement 
profits and losses of cft are shared equally by the partners 
the company anticipates that the carbon fiber from this facility will primarily be consumed by the joint venture partners  however  any excess carbon fiber produced at this facility could be marketed for sale to unrelated third parties 
the company continues to use its share of the output of this facility to satisfy a significant portion of its internal demand for carbon fiber 
if the carbon fiber facility is not operated at high production levels  either because of production difficulties or because there is not enough demand by the joint venture partners to justify that level of production  the cost per unit of carbon fiber consumed by the company and thus the cost of producing the company s golf shafts and other products is increased due to spreading the fixed costs of production over smaller volumes 
if demand is lower than production capacity  cft also runs the risk of building up excess inventory 
given the relatively low costs at the present time in the market for carbon fiber and the highly competitive market for graphite golf shafts  the failure to operate at high levels could adversely affect the company s gross margins or its ability to maintain competitive prices for its products 
although third party sales of carbon fiber could help justify high production levels and thus help control unit production costs  the weakness of the carbon fiber market and the overall excess capacity in the industry means that third party sales at cft are not likely to be significant at least until the overall market improves significantly 
the company does not expect third party sales at cft or the sale of prepreg to have a significant effect on either its sales or profitability for several years 
during the s  the graphite golf shaft industry became increasingly competitive  placing extraordinary pressure on the selling prices of the company s golf shafts and adversely affecting its gross profit margins and level of profitability 
the company s response has been to reduce its cost structure  principally by producing its own prepreg and by shifting the largest portion of its shaft production to its offshore facilities  while maintaining high quality and superior customer service 
the cost saving benefits of its efforts to vertically integrate its operations  particularly through carbon fiber manufacturing  have been limited somewhat due to historically low market prices for golf shaft raw materials in recent years  which  in some cases  have made carbon fiber available in the market at attractive prices when compared to the company s cost to purchase it from cft 
although the company s gross margins and profitability have continued to be adversely affected through this period despite its efforts  management believes that these efforts have been successful to date and is allowing the company to maintain  or in some cases enhance  its competitive position with respect to the major united states golf club companies that are its principal customers 
the company continues to look for opportunities to cut costs and to increase its market share 
the pressure on selling prices of both premium and value shafts under current market conditions  and the increased percentage of overall sales represented by value shafts has resulted in a reduction of approximately in the average selling price of the company s shafts over the last seven years  although in some cases average selling prices may increase slightly from period to period depending on the mix of products sold 
in addition  the percentage of overall golf clubs sold with graphite shafts appears to have leveled off after several decades of significant growth and most major club companies continue to seek multiple sources of supply for their shafts and  thus  are unwilling to commit to one principal graphite shaft supplier 
these trends are not likely to reverse themselves under current market conditions 
as a result  management does not anticipate meaningful overall improvement in the financial performance of the company s golf shaft operations for the foreseeable future 
as a result of an overall slump in golf equipment sales in as compared to  the company  as is the case with other golf equipment companies  experienced a very disappointing year in there will continue to be fluctuations in performance on a periodic basis  driven principally by the success of its key customers in selling clubs to consumers  but as selling prices continue to decrease  with increasing pressure on the company s margins  increases in unit sales in the future  even to levels comparable to those achieved in  are not likely to generate operating cash flows and net income at the levels achieved in or in other  similarly successful historical years 
based on the results of and the general trends and conditions of the golf industry over the last several years  the company addressed the issue of impairment of its long lived assets  specifically  goodwill  trademarks and patents 
in accordance with the company s policy  management assessed the recoverability of goodwill using undiscounted cash flow projections based on the remaining amortization period of goodwill and trademarks of thirty one years 
the company believes that the future projections represent management s best estimate of future undiscounted cash flows 
based on these projections  the company concluded that impairment existed 
in determining the amount of the impairment charge  the company utilized an independent valuation  which resulted in a write off of all the goodwill and intangible assets of approximately million 
the company is responding to the current prospects in its core golf shaft business in a variety of ways 
first  the company has recently introduced its new and innovative one shaft  which management intends to use to capture a portion of the market for premium branded custom shafts  which tend to sell at higher prices and gross margins than the standard shafts sold to club manufacturers 
the company cannot now predict the success of this new shaft in the market  although it anticipates that if it achieves significant market acceptance  the financial benefits are not anticipated to be material until second  the company continues to look for opportunities to sell its prepreg to other composite materials manufacturers and to manufacture other composite materials products  such as hockey sticks 
although the company has achieved some success in these areas  management continues to believe that the growth opportunities in these areas are limited and that sales of prepreg and of other composite materials products will not be material to its results of operations for at least several years 
third  management has concluded that its ownership interest in the joint venture that operates its carbon fiber plant does not offer significant value to the company and is seeking to sell its interest  either to its joint venture partner  sgl  or  with sgl s consent  to a third party  so that the capital currently committed to the joint venture could be redeployed more usefully for the company and its stockholders 
finally  the company continues to be receptive to other acquisition opportunities  in areas related to its core business and otherwise  in an effort to add the potential for meaningful growth in its overall profitability  although the company is not actively seeking such opportunities at the present time 
although management anticipates that operating cash flow levels are likely to be measurably lower for at least the next several years than was typical until a few years ago  given the absence of debt currently on the company s balance sheet  the company should be able to generate cash from operations in excess of its needs during this period 
this excess operating cash could be used for research and development or marketing activities related to its current core business or to support expansion of its current businesses either internally or through acquisitions 
at present  the company is unable to provide any assurances that it will identify and be able to negotiate a sale of its interest in the joint venture or that it will be able to successfully complete any potential acquisitions

liquidity and capital resources the company has in place a million revolving credit facility from a financial institution  which is secured by substantially all the assets of aldila golf and guaranteed by the company 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest  at the election of the company  at the bank reference rate or at the adjusted eurodollar rate plus  with a minimum rate of 
availability for borrowings under the line of credit  based on eligible accounts receivable and inventories  was approximately million at december  the line of credit renews effective july   unless terminated as of that date 
either party may terminate the line of credit agreement by giving the other party days written notice prior to the renewal date 
the company does not plan to terminate this agreement without having another facility in place and is not aware of any intention by the financial institution to terminate the agreement 
there are no termination penalties for early termination during the renewal periods 
the company made its final million principal payment on its senior notes on september  the senior notes bore interest at 
semi annual principal payments of million  plus accrued interest  were made september  through september  on october   the company received approximately million from the sale of a interest in its carbon fiber manufacturing operation 
these funds have been used to meet the working capital requirements of the company and the scheduled principal payments due under the senior notes 
cash including cash equivalents provided by operating activities in was  compared to in this decrease resulted principally from a decrease in net income and changes in working capital 
excluding the effects of the impairment charges  income decreased by approximately million 
working capital increased approximately  in  after payment of million of debt during the year 
the company used  for capital expenditures during management anticipates capital expenditures to approximate  for the company may also incur capital expenditures over the next several years to expand and enhance the production capacity of the cft operation in evanston  wyoming in order to take advantage of new opportunities brought to cft and further reduce production costs for the carbon fiber acquired by the company  in addition to an obligation to support one half of cft s fixed annual cost 
the company believes that it will have adequate cash resources  including anticipated cash flow and borrowing availability  to meet its obligations at least through the company may from time to time consider the acquisition of businesses complementary to the company s business 
the company could require additional debt financing if it were to engage in a material acquisition in the future 
seasonality because the company s customers have historically built inventory in anticipation of purchases by golfers in the spring and summer  the principal selling season for golf equipment  the company s operating results have been affected by seasonal demand for golf clubs  which has generally resulted in highest sales occurring in the second quarter 
the timing of customers new product introductions has frequently mitigated the impact of seasonality in recent years
