item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company specializes in the distribution  sale  service  rental and finance of equipment and trucks to the agricultural  construction  manufacturing  transportation and warehousing industries  as well as to public service entities  government agencies and utilities 
the company s stores are located in arizona  california  minnesota  montana  nebraska  north dakota  south dakota  texas and washington 
the company s largest supplier is deere 
the company generates its revenues from sales of new and used equipment and trucks  sales of parts and service  rental of equipment  customer financing and related products and services 
in addition to outright sales of new and used equipment  sales include equipment purchased under rent to purchase agreements 
generally under such agreements  the customer is given a period of several months to exercise the option to purchase the rented equipment and is allowed to apply a portion of the rental payments to the purchase price 
this rent to purchase equipment is included in the company s inventory until the option is exercised and the equipment is purchased 
the company s highest gross margins have historically been generated from its parts and service revenues 
one of the company s operating strategies is to increase the demand for parts and service by establishing  and then increasing  the base of equipment and trucks held by its customers 
due to product warranty time frames and usage patterns by customers  there generally is a time lag between equipment and truck sales and the generation of significant parts and service revenues from such sales 
as a result of this time lag  increases in parts and service revenues do not necessarily coincide with increases in equipment and truck sales 
in addition  due to differences in gross margins between equipment and truck sales and parts and service revenues  gross margin percentages may increase during periods of declining equipment and truck sales and decline when equipment and truck sales are strong 
the company generally experiences lower revenue levels during its first and fourth quarters primarily due to the crop growing season  winter weather conditions in the midwest and a general slowdown in construction activity at the end of the calendar year 
see seasonality below 
price increases by suppliers of the company s products have not historically had a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
see effects of inflation below 
the company requires cash primarily for financing its inventories of equipment  trucks and replacement parts  rental equipment  receivables and capital expenditures  including acquisitions 
historically  the company has met these liquidity requirements primarily through cash flow generated from operating activities  floor plan financing  and borrowings under credit agreements 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
during fiscal  the company was affected by various economic conditions in all operating segments 
the company s agricultural operations continued to reflect the challenging farm economy 
the company expects the general agricultural economic climate to remain stable yet challenging in fiscal during fiscal  the company s construction operations were affected by a general slowdown in equipment purchasing by construction equipment contractors in the company s geographic areas of responsibility  especially in the company s southern regions 
these conditions resulted in decreased market demand for equipment and increased competitive pressures in the company s operating regions 
the company expects these competitive pressures to continue into fiscal the company s truck operations were adversely affected by the depressed market demand for trucks 
in fiscal  the company purchased the remaining minority interest in salinas equipment distributors  inc as part of the company s plan to divest itself of the majority of its heavy duty truck business  the company completed transactions selling its truck center business located in dallas  fort worth  and waco  texas 
the company closed its material handling locations in grand island and lincoln  nebraska  and north sioux city  south dakota 
these territories are being serviced from the remaining locations in eagan  minnesota and omaha  nebraska 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company approved a comprehensive plan to restructure management and to divest the majority of its heavy duty truck business  retaining only the stores that are showing significant short term earnings potential and have generally been profitable through the years 
these actions allowed the company to increase its focus on its traditional core business lines of construction and agricultural equipment 
the company recognized charges to operations of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  reflecting the costs the company incurred 
the charges were comprised of a million loss on the sale of the company s roseville  minnesota truck business  approximately  of severance costs and the remainder consisted of asset impairments of long lived assets  such as fixed assets  leasehold imporvements and associated lease obligations  and goodwill related to the company s truck division 
severance costs paid during fiscal totaled approximately  resulting in a remaining severance accrual of approximately  cost incurred related to lease and other obligations totaled approximately  leaving an accrual of  as of the end of fiscal in fiscal  the company purchased the remaining minority interest in hall gmc  inc and hall truck center  inc 
as well as approximately of the minority interest in salinas equipment distributors  inc in connection with the company s plan to divest itself of the majority of its truck division  the truck dealership located in roseville  minnesota was sold 
the company consolidated the volvo dealership location in long beach  california into the company s riverside  california location 
the long beach market is being serviced through the company s riverside truck dealership 
the barnesville  minnesota agricultural retail store was consolidated with the fargo  north dakota agricultural operations 
in fiscal  the company purchased five heavy duty truck retail stores and commenced truck operations in its waco  texas location 
the company also closed one construction equipment rental store and sold its percent interest in a construction equipment rental operation located in the southwestern united states 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following accounting policies  which are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
inventories 
all inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method for new equipment  trucks and parts inventory 
the specific identification method is used to determine cost for used equipment and trucks 
revenue recognition 
revenue on equipment  truck and parts sales is recognized upon delivery of product to customers 
rental and service revenue is recognized at the time such services are provided 
in addition to outright sales of new and used equipment  certain rentals include rent to purchase option agreements 
under such agreements  customers are given a period of several months to exercise the option to purchase the rented equipment and may be allowed to apply a portion of the rental payments to the purchase price 
this rent to purchase equipment is included in the company s inventory until the option is exercised and the equipment is purchased 
revenue is not recognized until the option is exercised 
other assets 
other assets consist primarily of goodwill related to acquisitions and other intangible assets 
as stated in note  sfas no 
 provides that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized  but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment  and intangible assets that have finite useful lives should continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
also provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets for impairment 
sfas no 
requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions in order to allocate goodwill to reporting units and to determine the fair value of reporting unit net assets and liabilities  including  among other things  an assessment of market condition  projected cash flows  interest rates and growth rates  which could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires  in lieu of amortization  an initial impairment review of goodwill in the company s fiscal year and annual impairment test thereafter 
the company currently does not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed an impairment charge will not be recorded 
the impact of adopting sfas no 
 effective february   will result in the cessation of goodwill amortization which approximates million annually 
in addition  the company is exposed to the possibility that changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future  thus resulting in a potential increase in earnings volatility

revenues from construction and agricultural operations provide the company with higher gross margins than do truck operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased million  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal total sg a expenses as a percentage of total revenues for fiscal and were and  respectively 
sg a expenses are affected by the contribution of revenues by business segment and by the mix of revenues within each business segment 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses are generally higher for construction and financial services operations than for agricultural and truck operations  and lower for equipment and truck sales than for parts and service and rental revenues 
a primary contributing factor to the decrease in sg a expenses was the truck dealership sales

gross profit is affected by the contribution of revenues by business segment  by the mix of revenues within each business segment and by competition 
revenues from construction  rental and financial services operations generally provide the company with higher gross margins than do agricultural and truck operations 
the company s highest gross margins are generally derived from its parts and service  rental and financial services revenues 
during fiscal  construction margins declined due to competitive pressures as the company  along with competitors  attempted to capture a share of a declining market potential 
truck margins also declined during fiscal  related to competitive pressures due to high used truck inventory levels throughout the industry and declining demand primarily attributable to higher fuel prices  driver shortages and higher interest rates 
both construction and truck margins were affected by wholesale sales to reduce inventory levels to correlate to the current market environments 
financial services experienced margin declines due to higher interest rates and a tightening credit environment 
the sale of the construction equipment rental operations was another contributing factor to the decrease in gross profit from fiscal to selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal total sg a expenses as a percentage of total revenues for fiscal and were and  respectively

as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses are generally higher for construction and financial services operations than for agricultural  truck and rental operations and lower for equipment and truck sales than for parts and service and rental revenues 
the increase in sg a was primarily attributable to operating the riverside  california truck location for a full year  increased legal fees and higher than normal levels of sg a expenses related to the consolidation and integration of the company s acquired truck dealerships 
sg a as percentage of total revenues was higher in fiscal due to sg a levels in construction and truck operations not adjusting as rapidly as revenues declined 
interest expense interest expense decreased approximately million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal interest expense as a percentage of total revenues decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal interest expense as a percentage of total revenues decreased  despite higher interest rates  primarily due to a decrease in the level of interest bearing floor plan payables along with a lower level of long term debt

the higher effective tax rate for fiscal was related to the company s sale of its owned subsidiary  rdo rental co 
net income loss the company reported a net loss of million  or per share for fiscal compared to net income of million  or per share for fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company requires cash primarily for financing its inventories of equipment  trucks and replacement parts  rental equipment  receivables and capital expenditures  including acquisitions and openings of additional retail locations 
historically  the company has met these liquidity requirements primarily through cash flow generated from operating activities  floor plan financing  and borrowings under credit agreements with deere  deere credit  ag capital  deutsche financial  volvo finance  gmac  citicapital and commercial banks 
deere and deere credit provide the primary source of financing for equipment inventories  particularly for equipment supplied by deere 
the deere and deere credit floor plan financing provide extended terms and varying interest free periods  depending on the type of equipment  to enable dealers to carry representative inventories of equipment and to encourage the purchase of goods by dealers in advance of seasonal retail demand 
down payments are not required and interest might not be charged for a substantial part of the period for which inventories are financed 
often  purchase discounts are available in lieu of interest free periods 
variable market rates of interest based on the prime rate are charged on balances outstanding after any interest free periods  which are currently four to twelve months for agricultural equipment and four months for construction equipment 
the interest free periods may be longer depending on special financing programs offered from time to time 
deere and deere credit also provide financing to dealers on used equipment accepted in trade and approved equipment from other suppliers 
during fiscal  the deere credit financing program was expanded to provide funding for certain receivables 
collectively  the deere credit financing is a borrowing base facility 
volvo finance  gmac and citicapital provide truck floor plan financing with variable market rates of interest based on the prime rate 
on january   in addition to manufacturer provided floor plan financing  the company had unused credit commitments related to floor plan financing and on and off balance sheet financing of rental equipment of million 
the company had outstanding floor plan payables of approximately million  of which million was interest bearing as of january  the collateral of equipment and truck inventories along with eligible receivables would support million of additional borrowing at january  during fiscal   and the average interest rate under interest bearing floor plan financing was approximately  and  respectively 
currently  the company has an unsecured bank line of credit totaling million with a maturity date of july  and with a variable interest rate based on the prime rate at january  
the company had approximately  of unused availability relating to this line of credit at january  the average interest rates on the company s lines of credit during fiscal  and were  and  respectively 
the company believes it has sufficient credit availability from its existing credit facilities and manufacturers to finance its current and future operations 
various credit facilities are reviewed and renewed annually 
as the credit facilities approach maturity  the company believes it will be able to renew or extend these facilities  or replace these facilities with other facilities 
the company believes cash from operations  available cash and borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund its planned internal capital expenditures and other cash needs for fiscal the company s financing agreements contain various covenants which  among other matters  require the company to maintain minimum financial ratios  as defined  and a minimum level of tangible equity 
the company was in compliance with or obtained waiver letters for all covenants as of january  operating activities  including changes in inventories and related floor plan payables  provided net cash of million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
reduced levels of trade receivables and inventories  partially offset by reduced levels of floor plan payables  were the primary contributing factors to cash provided by operating activities for fiscal the cash generated by operating activities for fiscal primarily resulted from depreciation and amortization and reduced inventory levels and trade receivables  partially offset by reduced levels of payables  including floor plan payables 
the net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was after the truck sale and restructure 
cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal  which was primarily related to proceeds from the sale of the texas truck dealerships 
cash used for investing activities in fiscal and was million and  respectively 
the cash used in fiscal was primarily related to purchases of agricultural rental equipment  purchases of property and equipment  the purchase of the remaining minority interest in hall gmc  inc and hall truck center inc and the purchase of approximately of the minority interest in salinas equipment distributors  inc the cash used in fiscal was primarily related to acquisitions and the purchase of property and equipment for the company s operations 
cash used for financing activities amounted to million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the primary contributing factors for the use of cash in fiscal were payments of long term debt and the company s operating lines 
cash used for financing activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to payment of long term debt and net payments of bank lines and short term notes payable 
cash used for financing activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to payment of long term debt associated with the construction equipment rental company 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program that allows the company to repurchase up to ten percent of the company s outstanding class a common stock from time to time in both the open market and in privately negotiated transactions 
under the program  the company has repurchased  shares of class a common stock at a total cost of  as of january  the company also expects to continue to repurchase shares in the future as deemed appropriate 
effects of inflation inflation has not had a material impact upon operating results and the company does not expect it to have such an impact in the future 
to date  in those instances in which the company has experienced cost increases  it has been able to increase selling prices to offset such increases 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s business will not be affected by inflation or that it can continue to increase its selling prices to offset increased costs and remain competitive 
cyclicality sales of equipment and trucks  particularly new units  historically have been cyclical  fluctuating with general economic cycles 
during economic downturns  equipment and truck retailers tend to experience similar periods of decline and recession as the general economy 
the impact of an economic downturn on retailers is generally less than the impact on manufacturers due to the sale of parts and service by retailers to maintain used equipment and trucks 
the company believes that its businesses are influenced by worldwide and local economic conditions see safe harbor statement and that its geographic and business diversification will generally reduce the overall impact of economic cycles on the company s operations 
seasonality the company s agricultural operations  particularly in the midwest  generally experience a higher volume of equipment sales in the second and third fiscal quarters due to the crop growing season 
typically  farmers purchase equipment prior to planting or harvesting crops 
winter weather conditions in the midwest limit equipment purchases during the company s first and fourth fiscal quarters 
this seasonal effect can be diminished during periods of significant and sustained weakness in the agricultural economy during which farmers generally purchase less equipment 
the company s construction operations generally experience a higher volume of equipment sales in the second and third fiscal quarters due to favorable weather patterns  particularly in the midwest 
the general slowdown in construction activity at the end of the calendar year influences the fourth fiscal quarter 
further  winter weather conditions in parts of the southwest and south central also limit construction activity to some degree  typically resulting in lower sales and rentals of construction equipment 
if the company acquires businesses in geographic areas other than where it currently has operations  or disposes of certain businesses  it may be affected more by the above mentioned or other seasonal and equipment buying trends

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair value of financial instruments but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a net increase to the unrealized fair market value of the company s fixed rate debt by approximately  at january   the company had variable rate floor plan payables  notes payable and long term debt of million and fixed rate notes payable and long term debt of  holding other variables constant  the pre tax earnings and cash flow impact for the next year resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be approximately  the company s policy is not to enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
