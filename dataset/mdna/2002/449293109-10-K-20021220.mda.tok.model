item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results in operations introduction the company s revenues are primarily derived from product sales and toll services in the polymers processing industry 
product sales entail the company purchasing resin which is further processed within the company s operating facilities 
the further processing of the material may involve size reduction services and or compounding services 
compounding services include the manufacture and sale of concentrates 
after processing  the company then sells the finished products to customers 
toll services involve both size reduction and compounding services whereby these services are performed on customer owned material 
service revenues are recognized as the services are performed and  in the case of product sales  revenues are recognized when the title of the product passes to the customer  which is generally upon shipment to third parties 
cost of sales and services is primarily comprised of purchased raw materials  compensation and benefits to non administrative employees  occupancy costs  repair and maintenance  electricity and equipment costs and supplies 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits to the sales and marketing  executive management  information technology  accounting  legal  human resources and other administrative employees of the company  other sales and marketing expenses  communications costs  systems costs  insurance costs and legal and accounting professional fees 
demand for the company s products and services tends to be driven by overall economic factors and  particularly  consumer spending 
the trend of applicable resin prices also impacts customer demand 
as resin prices are falling  customers tend to reduce their inventories and  therefore  reduce their need for the company s products and services 
conversely  as resin prices are rising  customers often increase their inventories and accelerate their purchases of products and services from the company 
additionally  demand for the company s products and services tends to be seasonal  with customer demand being weakest during the company s first fiscal quarter due to the holiday season and also due to property taxes levied in the us on customers inventories on december the company s fourth fiscal quarter also tends to be softer compared to the company s second and third fiscal quarters  in terms of customer demand  due to vacation periods in the company s european markets 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
the following is a discussion of the company s critical accounting policies pertaining to use of estimates  revenue and related cost recognition  impairment of long lived assets and currency translation 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the more significant areas requiring use of estimates relate to post retirement and other employee benefit liabilities  valuation allowances for deferred tax assets  workers compensation  allowance for doubtful accounts related to accounts receivable  and fair value of financial instruments 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
management believes that its estimates are reasonable 
revenue and related cost recognition the company recognizes revenue from services upon completion of the services and related expenses are recognized as incurred 
for product and equipment sales  revenues and related expenses are recognized when title is transferred  which generally occurs when the products are shipped 
impairment of long lived assets property and equipment and goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
the impairment review includes comparison of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or group of assets with the associated assets carrying value 
if the carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
currency translation amounts in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars 
when local functional currency is translated to us dollars  the effects are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income 
exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recognized in earnings

to the extent that the company is unable to repay the principal amount of the notes out of cash on hand  it may i seek to repay the notes with the proceeds of an equity offering  ii seek refinancing  or iii sell significant assets 
there can be no assurance that any of the forgoing alternatives will be available to the company at all or on terms that are favorable to the company 
if the company cannot satisfy its obligations related to such indebtedness  substantially all of the company s long term debt could be in default and could be declared immediately due and payable which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s business cycles are affected by changes in the level of economic activity in the various regions in which the company operates and changes in the cost of the polymers ie resins produced by the major chemical companies 
these costs are outside of the company s control and the business cycles are generally volatile and relatively unpredictable 
in addition  the company is affected by cycles in the petroleum and oil and gas industries 
the operations of the company s business are dependent to a certain degree upon proprietary technology  know how and trade secrets either developed by the company or licensed to it by third parties 
in many cases  these or equivalent processes or technologies are available to the company s competitors  customers and others

the company entered the specialty polymers processing industry with its acquisition of wedco inc wedco in april  and had no experience in the industry prior to the acquisition 
since the acquisition of wedco  the company has expanded its specialty polymers processing operations by making numerous business acquisitions 
the success of the company will depend  in part  on the company s ability to continue the integration of acquired specialty chemical operations by  among other things  centralizing certain functions to achieve cost savings and developing programs and processes that will promote cooperation among the businesses and the sharing of resources 
in addition  the change in size of the company has and will continue to place significant demands on the company s management  internal systems and networks 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively manage or implement its plans for these operations or that  if implemented  such plans will be successful 
in addition  the company s product sales business  including the company s concentrate manufacturing operations require the company to buy inventories of supplies and products and to manage the risk of ownership of commodity inventories having fluctuating market values

a portion of the company s current operations is conducted in international markets  particularly the company s european  south american and pacific region specialty polymers processing services business 
the company expects to continue to seek to expand its international operations  primarily through internal growth and acquisitions 
the company s international operations are subject to certain political  economic and other uncertainties normally associated with international operations  including among others  risks of government policies regarding private property  taxation policies  foreign exchange restrictions and currency fluctuations and other restrictions arising out of foreign governmental sovereignty over areas in which the company conducts business that may limit or disrupt markets  restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights  and  possibly  civil disturbance or other forms of conflict 
losses from the factors above could be material in those countries where the company now has or may in the future have a concentration of assets 
the operations of the company involve many risks  which  even through a combination of experience  knowledge and careful evaluation  may not be overcome 
these risks include equipment or product failures or work related accidents which could also result in personal injury  property damages  pollution and other environmental risks 
the company may not be fully insured against possible losses pursuant to such risks 
such losses could have a material adverse impact on the company 
in addition  from time to time  the company is involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of its business and is currently involved in numerous legal proceedings in connection with its operations and those of its acquired companies 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur substantial liability as a result of these or other proceedings 
the company is subject to numerous and changing local  state  federal and foreign laws and regulations concerning the use  storage  treatment  disposal and general handling of hazardous materials  some of which may be considered to be hazardous wastes  and restricting releases of pollutants and contaminants into the environment 
these laws and regulations may require the company to obtain and maintain certain permits and other authorizations mandating procedures under which the company will operate and restricting emissions 
many of these laws and regulations provide for strict joint and several liabilities for the costs of cleaning up contamination resulting from releases of regulated materials into the environment 
violations of mandatory procedures under operating permits may result in fines  remedial actions or  in more serious instances  shutdowns or revocation of permits or authorizations 
there can be no assurance that a review of the company s past  present or future operations by courts or federal  state  local or foreign regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the revocation of any of the company s material operating permits  the denial of any material permit application or the failure to renew any material interim permit could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company cannot predict what environmental laws and regulations will be enacted or adopted in the future or how such future law or regulation will be administered or interpreted 
to date  the company has incurred compliance and clean up costs in connection with environmental laws and regulations and there can be no assurance as to future costs 
in particular  compliance with more stringent environmental laws and regulations  more vigorous enforcement policies  or stricter interpretations of current laws and regulations  or the occurrence of an industrial accident  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the industry in which the company participates is highly competitive 
some competitors or potential competitors of the company have substantially greater financial or other resources than the company
