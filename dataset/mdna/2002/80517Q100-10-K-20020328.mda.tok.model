oxsodrol human superoxide dismutase btg has developed a process for manufacturing a fully active analog of human copper zinc superoxide dismutase sod  which neutralizes oxygen free radicals 
many premature babies are deficient in naturally occurring sod  and the high concentrations of oxygen that premature babies require are believed to be involved in generating excess oxygen free radicals in the lungs  causing permanent lung injury at the cellular level 
btg s phase iii clinical efficacy and safety trial related to the use of sod to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia bpd  a chronic lung disease that develops following treatment with oxygen and mechanical ventilation of premature infants who experience respiratory distress  revealed no reduction in the combined incidence of bpd and death at days in neonates treated with oxsodrol 
however  preliminary data from earlier phase i investigations suggested a delayed protective effect in neonates treated with oxsodrol 
as a result  btg  in consultation with the fda  continued the trial as a phase ii study with preservation of blinded treatment assignments 
the incidence of pulmonary and neurologic complications in the placebo and oxsodrol treated groups was assessed at one year corrected postnatal age 
this follow up study revealed a reduction in the incidence of reactive airways ie  asthma in the oxsodrol treated babies 
btg is in the process of finalizing plans for additional clinical trials focused on prevention of chronic respiratory morbidity  or lung injury  in premature babies and is currently in the late stage of discussions with the fda regarding this indication 
the additional phase iib trial is expected to begin in the second half of in january  we licensed oxsodrol to jcr for the treatment of bpd in japan and  in august  we licensed worldwide distribution rights excluding the united states  canada  israel and japan for oxsodrol for the treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and other respiratory indications to ares trading sa  a member of the ares serono group 
although btg has elected to discontinue pursuing the bpd indication and to focus on the chronic respiratory morbidity indication  jcr has expressed an interest in continuing with the bpd indication 
in august  serono elected not to continue its participation in the development of oxsodrol 
in december  we entered into a cross license agreement with chiron corporation chiron to settle two patent interference actions and patent opposition proceedings between chiron and us 
as a result of the cross license agreement  chiron s patents are no longer a barrier to the commercialization of our human copper zinc sod product in the united states 
however  the existence of the cross license agreement does not necessarily assure our ability to commercialize oxsodrol

puricase gout occurs when uric acid accumulates in the joints 
the disease causes severe pain and disability and creates a risk of kidney failure  which may lead to life threatening complications 
current treatments for gout and related conditions are sometimes ineffective because of side effects or lack of efficacy of approved medications 
peg uricase is a chemically modified enzyme of mammalian origin that converts uric acid to a more soluble and readily excreted product 
the peg modified enzyme has a much longer circulating lifetime and is less likely to induce immune reactions than the unmodified enzyme 
therefore  the peg uricase enzyme should effectively and efficiently eliminate excess uric acid from the body of individuals who cannot otherwise excrete excess uric acid 
in august btg licensed exclusive worldwide rights from duke university medical center duke of north carolina and mountain view pharmaceuticals  inc mvp to technology relating to polyethylene glycol peg conjugates of uricase urate oxidase 
duke has developed recombinant uricases and  together with mvp  has developed peg conjugates of uricases to make them safer and longer acting 
mvp has transferred its peg technology to btg  and we will produce peg conjugates of uricase  undertake clinical trials and commercialize the product 
in february we received orphan drug designation for the use of this product in the treatment of gout patients for whom conventional therapy is contraindicated or has been ineffective 
we filed an ind with the fda in november and the phase i clinical trial started in february at duke university medical center 
fibrimage thrombus imaging agent fibrimage formerly called imagex is a novel agent for the detection of thrombi and blood clots in patients suffering from deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism 
deep vein thrombosis  which results from the development of thrombi  causes a reduction in the venous blood flow 
pulmonary embolism is the dislodgement of a piece of thrombus and its relocation via the circulatory system to the lungs 
fibrimage consists of a genetically engineered portion of the fibrin binding domain of fibronectin attached to a radiopharmaceutical tag 
once injected in the patient  it targets and binds to fibrin  a substance that is essentially present only in blood clots 
btg holds various patents covering fibrimage in the united states  in european jurisdictions derived from its european patent  and in australia  finland  hong kong  hungary  japan  korea  new zealand  norway and russia 
in august  we licensed worldwide rights to the polypeptide to merck frosst canada inc merck frosst for the development and commercialization of a diagnostic imaging agent for the detection of thromboembolism 
merck frosst filed an application for an investigational new drug ind with the canadian bureau of biologics in april in september draxis health inc draxis acquired the radio pharmaceutical division of merck frosst and all rights to fibrimage 
draxis successfully completed a phase i study of fibrimage in canada in december  and a phase ii study in in february  draxis initiated a phase iii efficacy study in canada 
filing for approval in canada is expected in the second half of btg btg is developing btg  based on a human antibody fragment  as a first line therapy during remission and as a second line therapy to treat relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia aml patients 
it may be linked to a chemical conjugate or a cytotoxic agent 
currently  treatment practice for newly diagnosed aml patients is uniform and highly effective at induction of remission 
however  significant unmet medical need exists for therapies that prolong remission and are effective for refractory and relapsed patients 
btg is being developed in response to their needs 
btg expects to commence toxicology studies in btg will require patent licenses from several companies in order to commercialize btg btg is currently in advanced discussions with one licensor  and has begun preliminary discussions with several other companies 
we cannot assure you that we will able to obtain these licenses on reasonable terms or at all 
if we are not able to obtain these licenses  we will not be able to commercialize btg in addition to aml cells  btg binding was demonstrated in b cell related malignancies  including multiple myeloma mm  indicating its potential clinical utility in other indications such as other sub types of leukemia and metastatic tumors 
in addition to its therapeutic potential in aml and mm  y might also be used as a diagnostic agent prior to patient treatment  since of aml patients are y reactive 
biogenerica tm pursuant to a strategic relationship entered into with teva pharmaceutical industries ltd  btg is currently pursuing the development of two recombinant human therapeutic proteins chosen by teva that are currently marketed worldwide by other biotech companies and which are approaching the end of their patent protection

research and development we conduct research on potential products for which we have retained future rights for our own account and on behalf of our partners for which we receive certain current payments and  if successful  future payments in the form of royalties or manufacturing rights 
at february   our research and development organization comprised scientists  associates and related personnel with expertise in molecular biology  cell biology and protein chemistry 
these individuals have received various undergraduate and advanced degrees at prestigious universities throughout the world 
twenty six hold phd or phd degrees  and several have completed post doctoral studies under the direction of internationally renowned scientists in the area of biotechnology 
btg applies to the chief scientist of the state of israel the chief scientist annually for research and development funding for its various projects for the coming year 
the projects and amount funded each year are within the sole discretion of the chief scientist 
there can be no assurance that btg will be able to continue to secure additional funds from the chief scientist at the same levels or at all 
btg is obligated to pay royalties to the chief scientist for products resulting from research and development partially funded by the chief scientist 
these royalties range from to on commercial sales  if any  of these products if produced in israel  up to the amount so funded  and to of commercial sales  if any  if these products are produced outside israel  up to to of the amount so funded 
during  btg completed payment of its entire obligation for royalties to the chief scientist for funding of its human growth hormone development 
manufacturing and supply agreements we currently operate a good manufacturing practices certified facility in israel for production of our bulk human growth hormone  biolon  bio hep b  oxsodrol  arthrease and insulin products  as well as the genetically engineered portion of the fibrimage product 
we also operate a modern filling suite for our biolon and arthrease syringes  which has undergone inspection and was approved by european and us regulatory authorities 
based on these inspections  european device approval ce mark and  in the case of biolon  fda approval were granted 
although a substantial portion of the hgh supplied by btg to its distributors is in bulk form  btg also provides distributors with fully packaged product 
for these distributors  btg s bulk human growth hormone is formulated  filled and packed in vials in germany by dr 
madaus gmbh  our subcontractor for manufacturing the packaged product 
in addition  sterilization of the biolon syringe is performed by mediplast israel ltd  our subcontractor for these purposes 
we believe that we operate our facilities under  and are in compliance in all material respects with  current fda good laboratory and manufacturing practices 
in april  btg purchased an existing building located approximately miles south of its current facility in israel 
construction of a modern production facility meeting fda gmp requirements for drugs  biologics and devices was completed at the end of  and qualification activities have been commenced and are expected to be completed in the second half of the new facility is designed to allow us to meet all current regulatory requirements and our currently foreseeable manufacturing capacity needs 
products we intend to manufacture at this facility cannot be shipped into the united states until the fda has inspected and approved this facility 
as a result of the current violence in israel  the fda has suspended inspections of manufacturing facilities in israel 
we do not currently intend to transfer our manufacturing activities to this facility until it has been inspected and approved by the fda 
our oxandrin product is currently being manufactured for us by searle  which originally developed the product 
our agreement with searle provides that searle will produce and exclusively sell oxandrin to btg 
the agreement requires that btg purchase from searle at least of its oxandrin bulk requirements from searle 
the agreement currently expires in april  subject to earlier termination under certain circumstances  and is automatically renewed for successive two year periods unless terminated by either party 
the agreement provides that searle will not produce oxandrin for any other entity prior to april in addition to a long term exclusive supply agreement with searle  btg has an alternative exclusive agreement with societa prodotti antibiotici spa spa covering  if necessary  the supply of oxandrolone to btg through at least the year  contingent on spa obtaining certain regulatory approvals 
to date spa has been unable to gain such approvals 
as a result  in february  we entered into a supply agreement with gedeon richter ltd 
grl pursuant to which grl will supply oxandrolone to btg on an exclusive basis provided certain annual minimum purchase requirements are met 
should searle for any reason be unable to supply oxandrin to btg prior to grl obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals  btg s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected

in february  btg israel was awarded iso certification by the standards institution of israel sii 
the certification was issued with respect to the manufacture  packaging and dispatch of btg s pharmaceutical products for human use 
iso is one of a series of quality management system standards established by the international organization for standardization iso based in geneva  switzerland 
it is equivalent to the european community standard en sii is a member of an international organization  the international quality certification network iqnet that encompasses quality certification institutes worldwide in a mutual recognition agreement 
receipt of the iso certification was a significant milestone in the process of obtaining the biolon ce mark 
in august  sii awarded btg israel iso certification for its environmental management system 
the iso series of standards  dealing with the environment and its protection  are important from both a regulatory and commercial point of view 
governmental regulation regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries is a significant factor affecting the timing of the commercialization of our products and our ongoing research and development activities 
btg s policy is to conduct its research and development activities in compliance with current united states national institutes of health guidelines for research involving recombinant dna molecules  and with comparable guidelines in israel and other countries where we may be conducting clinical trials or other developmental activities 
see risk factors we are subject to stringent governmental regulation 
clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing of human pharmaceutical products require prior approval from the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries 
the fda has established mandatory procedures and safety and efficacy standards that apply to the testing  manufacture and marketing of such products in the united states 
in the united states  these procedures include pre clinical studies  the filing of an investigational new drug application ind  human clinical trials and approval of an nda 
european countries generally follow the same procedures 
the european union has established a unified filing system administered by the committee for proprietary medicinal products cpmp designed to reduce the administrative burden of processing applications for new pharmaceutical products 
following cpmp review and approval  marketing applications are submitted to member countries for final approval and pricing approval  as appropriate 
these processes are likely to take a number of years and often involve substantial expenditures 
there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted and  even if granted  such approval may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained 
in addition  certain environmental and consumer groups are generally opposed to genetically engineered products  although their opposition is primarily in the agricultural field 
there can be no assurance that opposition from such groups will not adversely affect the fda approval process with respect to our biotechnology products 
in addition to the foregoing  btg s present and future business may be subject to regulation under the united states atomic energy act  drug enforcement agency  clean air act  clean water act  occupational safety and health act  national environmental policy act  toxic substances control act  resource conservation and recovery act  comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and similar state and foreign statutes  as well as national restrictions on technology transfer  and import  export and customs regulations and similar laws and regulations in foreign countries 
patents and proprietary rights our scientific staff and consultants are actively working in various areas of biotechnology to develop techniques  microorganisms  processes and products to achieve btg s commercial aims 
btg protects its intellectual property rights in this work by a variety of means  including filing patent and trademark applications in the united states  europe and other major industrialized countries 
btg also relies upon design registrations  trade secrets and improvements  unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain its competitive position 
see risk factors we depend upon proprietary technology  which may be difficult to protect 
as of february   btg was maintaining worldwide approximately issued patents either owned or exclusively licensed by btg  including patents issued in the united states  patents issued by the european patent office epo  which in turn resulted in the issuance of national patents in europe  and patents issued in israel 
additionally  approximately patent applications owned or exclusively licensed by btg are pending in various countries 
there can be no assurance that any of the patent applications assigned or licensed to btg will result in issued patents  or that issued patents will not be circumvented or invalidated 
we believe that important legal issues remain to be resolved as to the extent and scope of patent protection  and we expect that in certain cases litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of our and others proprietary rights 
such litigation may consume substantial amounts of our resources 
see risk factors we depend upon proprietary technology  which may be difficult to protect and item legal proceedings 
we are aware of patent applications filed by  or patents issued to  other entities with respect to technology potentially useful to btg and  in some cases  related to products and processes being developed by btg 
we cannot presently assess the effect  if any  that these patents may have on our operations 
the extent to which efforts by other researchers have or will result in patents and the extent to which the issuance of patents to others would have a materially adverse effect on our business or would force us to obtain licenses from others is currently unknown 
see risk factors we depend upon proprietary technology  which may be difficult to protect 
to date  btg has been  or currently is  party to several legal and administrative proceedings relating to its technologies  products and patents and the patents of others 
see item legal proceedings 
institutional and governmental relationships we believe our relationships with research institutions in the united states  europe and israel and with the government of israel to be important in our research and product development efforts 
we believe that these relationships greatly enhance our research and product development efforts  and we intend to develop and maintain relationships with leading universities and research institutions even as we continue to expand our capability to conduct research and product development at our own facilities 
the state of israel supports and encourages research and development in the field of high technology  as well as manufacturing for export through programs that provide for research and development funding  export financing  tax benefits and capital investment incentives 
btg s research and development activities in israel through btg israel enable us to take advantage of these programs 
there can be no assurance  however  that such programs will continue 
operations in israel btg s primary research and development and production activities are conducted in israel and are affected by economic  military and political conditions there and in the middle east in general 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors and a state of hostility  which varies in degree and intensity  has caused security and economic problems in israel 
any major hostilities involving israel could adversely affect our research  development and production operations  which would harm our business 
we cannot assure you that ongoing or revived hostilities related to israel will not have a material adverse affect on us or our business and on our share price 
despite the progress towards peace between israel and its arab neighbors  the future of these peace efforts is uncertain 
in addition  since october  there has been a significant increase in violence  primarily in the west bank and gaza strip 
during the course of military operations  israel s military reserves  which include a number of our employees and executives  may be called up 
to date  we have been able to continue our research and development and production activities during periods of military mobilization  although there can be no assurance that such activities could be continued in the event of future hostilities 
see risk factors our business may be adversely affected by developments in israel 
as a result of the current violence in israel  the fda has suspended inspections of manufacturing facilities in israel 
products we intend to manufacture at our newly constructed manufacturing facility cannot be shipped into the united states until the fda has inspected and approved this facility 
we do not currently intend to transfer our manufacturing activities to our newly constructed manufacturing facility until the fda has inspected and approved the new facility 
continued suspension of these activities by the fda will delay the commencement of manufacturing at our new facility  which could adversely affect our business 
the suspension of fda inspections has delayed inspection of the contract sterilizer utilized by btg for its biolon product  which has required us to stop shipping biolon to the united states until the facility is inspected or btg qualifies a new contract sterilizer 
btg is now in the process of securing alternate arrangements to prevent potential interruption of manufacturing activities 
because btg israel is involved in a technological industry and is an exporter of israeli goods  btg has enjoyed the benefits of certain programs promulgated by the government of israel in order to encourage the development of technology and export of israeli products 
however  there can be no guarantee that these programs will continue 
competition therapeutic drug development is conducted by numerous companies throughout the world 
competition is intense in the product areas in which btg has focused its efforts 
significant competition comes from independent  dedicated biotechnology companies as well as from large  established pharmaceutical companies 
the primary competitive factors in this field are the ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientists and technicians  to create and maintain scientifically advanced technology during a period of rapid technological development and to develop proprietary products or processes 
the principal parameters influencing competition are the efficacy of products and their production processes  the patent protection available for such products  the timing of commercialization vis a vis competitors products and price 
btg s competitive position in the industry varies on a product by product and country by country basis depending upon the efficacy of btg s products as compared to competing products  the scope of patent protection in each country for btg s products as compared to competing products  whether btg s product is the first such product to be commercialized and  where there are a number of similar products  the price of btg s product as compared to its competitors products  and the relative strength of btg s partner in the territory 
many of our current competitors have significantly greater financial and organizational resources than us 
since technological developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace in the biotechnology industry  the successful development of btg s products will be dependent upon its ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to its technology 
see risk factors we operate in a highly competitive market and our competitors may develop alternative technologies and products 
we are currently seeking to expand our operations and product pipeline through the acquisition of businesses  products and or technologies 
we face significant competition for acquisitions  which could adversely affect our ability to expand our operations and product pipeline 
see risk factors we are seeking to expand through acquisition  which entails risks 
employees as of february   we had employees  most of whom are engaged in research  development  manufacturing  quality assurance and marketing and sales activities  including who hold phd or phd degrees 
in addition  we have consulting arrangements with scientists at various institutions and universities in the united states and israel 
btg s ability to develop marketable products and to establish and maintain its competitive position in light of technological developments will depend  in part  on its ability to attract and retain qualified scientific  marketing and management personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
none of btg s employees is represented by a labor union and btg has experienced no work stoppages 
we believe our relations with our employees are good and we have experienced a low turnover rate among our employees

we are dependent on oxandrin sales 
sales of oxandrin in  and amounted to approximately million  million and million  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of btg s total product sales in those periods 
quarterly fluctuations in sales of oxandrin can have a significant impact on our quarterly results of operations 
quarterly sales of oxandrin in  and are set forth in the following table first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total in thousands our sales of oxandrin consist of sales to gentiva health services  inc gentiva  our wholesale and retail distributor of oxandrin in the united states  and the ross products division of abbott laboratories 
the decrease in oxandrin sales in the second half of was due to the oxandrin inventory reduction that gentiva began in april as a result of a slowing in the rate of increase in oxandrin prescriptions 
the increase in oxandrin sales in each of the last three quarters of was due to gentiva s completion  in may  of this oxandrin inventory reduction 
the increase in oxandrin sales during the first half of was due to i the commencement  in september  of sales by the ross products division of abbott laboratories for the long term care market for the treatment of patients with involuntary weight loss  including stocking activity by wholesalers in connection with the launch of this product in the long term care market  ii stocking by certain wholesalers in anticipation of a price increase  iii increased purchases by gentiva following its completion  in may  of a reduction in the amount of oxandrin inventory it carried  which reduction began in april  and iv increased wholesaler sales of oxandrin by gentiva 
upon completion of its inventory reduction in may  gentiva began to purchase  on a monthly basis  an amount of oxandrin equal to the average end user ie  wholesaler sales during the preceding three months 
however  because of the significant increase in oxandrin purchases by wholesalers in the first quarter of in anticipation of a price increase and in connection with the launch of oxandrin into the long term care market  gentiva s purchases of oxandrin in the second quarter were higher than the levels of its sales of oxandrin to wholesalers in that period 
as a result  gentiva s inventory of oxandrin increased beyond the desired level 
accordingly  btg and gentiva amended their distribution arrangement effective august to provide for reduced purchases of oxandrin until gentiva s inventory was reduced to desired levels and thereafter to ensure that sales of oxandrin by btg to gentiva more accurately reflected end user demand 
as a result  sales of oxandrin in the second half of were million lower than in the first half of and million lower than in the second half of gentiva s reduction in oxandrin inventory adversely affected the growth in btg s product sales and revenues and btg s results of operations in and reductions in wholesaler purchases of oxandrin from gentiva in the second  third and fourth quarters of and significantly reduced purchases of oxandrin by gentiva in the second half of adversely affected the growth in btg s product sales and revenues and btg s results of operations in the second half of because purchases by wholesalers fluctuate from month to month and quarter to quarter based on their own operating strategies including desired levels of inventories  purchases by their customers and stocking in advance of anticipated price increases  btg s sales to gentiva and ross will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
there can be no assurance that gentiva will not determine to further reduce its oxandrin inventory levels 
since btg s launch of oxandrin in december through december  a significant portion of oxandrin sales has been for treatment of patients suffering from aids related weight loss 
however  the rate of growth in the aids related weight loss market has slowed substantially  and there can be no assurance that it will continue to grow in the future 
our inability to continue to increase our sales in the aids related weight loss market or to expand into other markets could have a material adverse effect on our business 
oxandrin sales experienced rapid growth in december and the first half of in large part as a result of the commencement by the ross products division of abbott laboratories of the marketing of oxandrin for the treatment of involuntary weight loss in the long term care market 
although oxandrin prescriptions increased in compared to  prescriptions in the second half of  although higher than in the second half of  were below prescriptions in the first half of in addition  to date the average prescription written for the long term care market involves a lower dose of oxandrin than the average prescription written for the aids market 
ross has the right to terminate our oxandrin co marketing agreement at any time upon six months notice 
it ross elects to terminate the agreement  our oxandrin sales could be adversely affected until we are able to replace the ross sales force  which we may not be able to do successfully 
there can be no assurance that demand for oxandrin will continue to increase 
oxandrin is facing increasing competition from other products  including human growth hormone  and there can be no assurance that sales of oxandrin will continue to increase 
a substantial number of users of oxandrin are patients with aids and as more successful treatments for this disease  such as protease inhibitors  are developed  the need to use oxandrin by these patients may be reduced 
although btg is working to expand the use of oxandrin to treat other conditions covered by the product s current fda approval  such as the treatment of involuntary weight loss associated with burns  non healing wounds  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer  there can be no assurance that btg will be successful in its efforts 
additionally  there are no patents covering the use of oxandrin and there can be no assurance that others will not introduce an oxandrolone product 
we are dependent on third party suppliers 
btg is dependent on third parties for the manufacture of oxandrin and delatestryl and the filling and vialing of its bio tropin product 
although btg is a party to an exclusive supply arrangement with searle  covering the supply of oxandrin to btg through  and a supply agreement with grl  there can be no assurance that searle will continue  or that grl will be able  to provide btg with sufficient supplies of oxandrin to satisfy its future needs 
bms ceased manufacturing delatestryl for btg in july when it closed the manufacturing facility where it produced delatestryl 
btg has an inventory of delatestryl which it believes will be adequate to satisfy demand for delatestryl until btg can establish and obtain fda approval of a new manufacturing relationship 
however  if we cannot establish and obtain fda approval of a new delatestryl manufacturing relationship on a timely basis  or demand for delatestryl exceeds our expectations  our ability to satisfy demand for delatestryl will be adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to establish and obtain fda approval of a new delatestryl manufacturing relationship on a timely basis or at all 
in addition  btg is dependent on dr 
madaus gmbh dr 
madaus to fill and vial our bio tropin product 
third party suppliers may encounter difficulties in achieving quality control and quality assurance  and also may experience shortages in qualified personnel  and therefore may not be able to meet our production schedules 
switching suppliers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited 
a shutdown in any of the manufacturing facilities utilized by btg s suppliers due to technical  regulatory or other problems  resulting in an interruption in supply of products  could significantly delay the manufacture of one or more of our products  which could have an adverse impact on our financial results 
the manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated  and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations 
the current fda good manufacturing practices are extensive regulations governing the manufacturing process  stability testing  record keeping and quality standards 
we do not have control over  other than by contract  third party manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards 
because the suppliers of key components and materials must be named in an nda filed with the fda for a product  significant delays can occur if the qualification of a new supplier is required 
in the event of any interruption in supply from searle  grl or dr 
madaus due to regulatory reasons  processing problems  capacity constraints or other causes  alternative manufacturing arrangements may not be available on a timely basis  if at all 
any failure of searle  grl or dr 
madaus to fulfill its obligations to btg could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
see manufacturing and supply agreements 
we currently utilize a contract sterilizer located in israel in connection with the manufacture of our biolon product 
the contract sterilizer has moved its operations to a new manufacturing facility which must be inspected by the fda 
however  as a result of the current violence in israel  the fda has suspended inspections of manufacturing facilities in israel 
the fda s delay in inspecting this facility has required us to stop shipping biolon to the united states until the facility is inspected or we qualify an alternative contract sterilizer 
we cannot assure you that the facility will be inspected in the near term  or that we can qualify an alternative contract sterilizer on reasonable terms in a timely manner or at all 
we are dependent on third party licensees 
btg is dependent on third party licensees to distribute its products outside the united states and israel and to distribute certain of its products in the united states 
these arrangements typically provide our licensees with certain rights to manufacture and market specified products developed using our proprietary technology  subject to an obligation to pay royalties to us based on any future product sales or to purchase product from us  and require the licensee to conduct required clinical trials and obtain any necessary regulatory approvals 
the success of these arrangements depends on each licensee s own financial  competitive  marketing and strategic considerations  which include the relative advantages  including patent and proprietary positions  of alternate products being marketed or developed by others 
furthermore  the amounts of any payments to be received by btg under its license agreements from sales of product by licensees will be dependent on the extent to which its licensees devote resources to the development and commercialization of the products 
although we believe our licensees have an economic motivation to commercialize their products  we have no effective control over the licensees commercialization efforts 
btg may from time to time seek to collaborate with larger pharmaceutical companies on the research  development and commercialization of certain products 
in trying to attract corporate partners to collaborate in the research  development and commercialization process  btg faces serious competition from other biopharmaceutical companies and the in house research and development staffs of the larger pharmaceutical companies 
if btg is unable to enter into arrangements with corporate partners  its ability to proceed with the research  development and commercialization of its products may be severely limited 
furthermore  larger pharmaceutical companies often explore multiple technologies and products for the same medical conditions 
therefore  they are likely to enter into collaborations with btg s competitors for products addressing the same medical conditions addressed by btg s products 
depending on how other product candidates advance  a corporate partner may slow down or abandon its work on btg s product candidates or terminate its collaborative arrangement with btg in order to focus on these other prospects 
we depend upon proprietary technology  which may be difficult to protect 
btg s success will depend  in part  on its ability to obtain patent protection for its technology including use of its products  preserve trade secrets and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
patent disputes are frequent and costly  can delay or preclude the commercialization of products and could subject btg to significant liabilities to third parties 
many biopharmaceutical companies have employed intellectual property litigation as a way to gain a competitive advantage 
btg has developed patentable technology and proprietary know how and has acquired from various universities and institutions certain basic technologies  as to which either patents have been issued or patent applications are pending 
there can be no assurance that patent applications will result in issued patents  that the claims allowed in such issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary rights or that patents will not be challenged  circumvented or invalidated or that rights granted pursuant to such patents will provide competitive advantages to btg 
because patent applications are maintained in secrecy for a period of time after filing  we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for such technology 
btg also relies on trade secrets  proprietary know how and technological innovation that it seeks to protect with confidentiality agreements with its employees  consultants and licensees 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that btg will have adequate remedies for any breach or that btg s trade secrets and proprietary know how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
btg s commercial success will also depend in part on our not infringing patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
a number of companies and research and academic institutions have developed technologies  filed patent applications or received patents on various technologies that relate to our business  and such entities may file applications for or be issued patents in the future with respect to technology potentially necessary or useful to btg 
some of these technologies  applications or patents may conflict with btg s technologies and existing or future patents  if any  or patent applications 
such conflict could limit the scope of patents that btg has obtained or may obtain in the future or result in patent applications failing to issue as patents 
in addition  if third parties obtain patents which cover our activities  there can be no assurance that btg would be able to license such patents on reasonable terms  or at all  or be able to license or develop alternative technology on a timely basis  or at all 
as more patents are issued to third parties  the risk that btg s products and activities may give rise to claims that they infringe the patents of others increases 
in addition  the presence of patents or other proprietary rights belonging to other parties may lead to the termination of research and development of a particular product 
btg has in the past been  is currently and may in the future be involved in litigation and administrative hearings to determine the validity and scope of its and others patents and proprietary rights 
such litigation and administrative proceedings have to date required  and may in the future require  a significant commitment of our resources 
any such commitment may divert resources from other areas of btg s business 
see item legal proceedings 
the successful development of pharmaceutical products is costly and highly uncertain 
a substantial portion of our annual operating budget is spent on research  development and clinical activities 
we are currently developing several products that may never reach clinical trials  achieve success in the clinic  be submitted for approval  be approved for manufacturing or marketing or achieve commercial success 
further  we rely on third parties to assist in various stages of the development process 
these third parties may be unable to complete their work in a timely fashion or in a manner that is satisfactory to us 
should they be unable to meet our needs  our product development process would be delayed and we may have to incur substantial additional costs 
successful pharmaceutical product development is highly uncertain and is dependent on numerous factors  many of which are beyond btg s control 
products that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons  including  but not limited to they may be found to be ineffective or to have harmful side effects in pre clinical or clinical testing  they may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  they may turn out to be uneconomical because of manufacturing costs or other factors  or they may be precluded from commercialization by the proprietary rights of others or by competing products for the same indication 
success in pre clinical and early clinical trials does not ensure that large scale trials will be successful 
data obtained from pre clinical and clinical trials are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay  limit or prevent regulatory approvals 
many biopharmaceutical companies  including btg  have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after experiencing promising results in pre clinical and early human testing 
btg is currently seeking to expand its product pipeline through the acquisition of businesses  products and or technologies 
the acquisitions that btg is currently able to pursue in general involve products that are still in clinical trials and  therefore  face the risks discussed above 
to the extent btg uses its cash resources  incurs debt and or issues shares of its common stock in these acquisitions but the acquired product cannot be commercialized  btg s business and prospects could be adversely affected 
the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by a regulatory authority varies significantly and is dependent upon a number of factors  many of which are outside our control  including the rate of patient enrollment 
patient enrollment is a function of several factors  including the size of the patient population and the proximity of patients to clinical sites 
delays in patient enrollment could result in increased costs and delays in completion of the clinical trials 
in addition  pre clinical and clinical trials must meet regulatory and institutional requirements 
the principal factors affecting btg s research and development expenses include the number of and outcome of clinical trials currently being conducted by it and or its collaborators  the number of products in development and later stage research and future levels of revenue 
we have limited manufacturing capacity 
the manufacture of btg s products involves a number of technical steps and requires meeting stringent quality control specifications imposed by governmental regulatory bodies and by btg itself 
further  such products can only be manufactured in facilities approved by the applicable regulatory authorities 
as a result  btg may not be able to quickly and efficiently replace its manufacturing capacity in the event that it is unable to manufacture its products at its facilities 
in the event of a natural disaster  equipment failure  strike  war or other difficulty  btg may be unable to manufacture its products in a manner necessary to fulfill demand 
btg s inability to fulfill demand may permit its licensees and distributors to terminate their agreements  seek alternate suppliers or manufacture the products themselves 
additionally  if btg does not receive regulatory approval for its new facility  it would likely be unable to meet the anticipated increased demand for its products  which would have a material adverse effect on btg s business  results of operations and financial condition 
any substantial delay in obtaining regulatory approval for its manufacturing processes and facilities could also have a material adverse effect on btg 
as a result of the current violence in israel  the fda has suspended inspections of manufacturing facilities in israel  which could delay fda inspection of btg s new manufacturing facility and  therefore  use of such facility to manufacture products 
btg is dependent on third parties to manufacture all or a portion of certain of its products 
see we are dependent on third party suppliers 
we have limited marketing capability and experience 
btg established a sales and marketing force in the united states during the second half of to promote distribution of oxandrin and other btg products in the united states 
with respect to territories outside the united states  btg does not yet have an established sales force and relies on third parties to market its products 
there can be no assurance that our marketing strategy will be successful 
turnover in our sales and marketing employees adversely affects our product sales  as it can take several months to find and train new sales and marketing employees 
competition for experienced sales and marketing employees is intense  and we compete with companies with greater resources and larger product lines 
btg s ability to market its products successfully in the future will be dependent on a number of factors  many of which are not within its control 
see we are dependent on third party licensees 
we are seeking to expand through acquisitions  which entails risk 
btg is currently seeking to expand its operations and product pipeline through the acquisition of businesses  products and or technologies 
expansion through acquisition involves several risks 
in order to consummate an acquisition  btg may issue additional equity  which would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership and could dilute earnings per share  incur substantial debt and or assume contingent liabilities 
btg may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business  product and or technology without a significant expenditure of operating  financial and management resources  if at all 
in addition  acquired businesses may not at the time of acquisition be profitable  and acquired products may require substantial additional research and development and clinical trials before they can be commercialized  all of which could adversely affect btg s results of operations and financial position 
potential products acquired at an early stage of development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons  including those set forth above under the successful development of pharmaceutical products is costly and highly uncertain 
to the extent we acquire technology that is not fully commercially developed and has no alternative future use at the time of acquisition  we will be required to write off immediately the fair market value of such technology  which will adversely affect our results of operations 
we expect our quarterly results to fluctuate  which may cause volatility in our stock price 
btg s revenues and expenses have in the past and may in the immediate future continue to display significant variations  which variations have in the past caused and would in the future cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
these variations are due to a variety of factors  including the amount and timing of product sales  the timing of the introduction of new products  the timing and realization of milestone and other payments from licensees  the timing and amount of expenses relating to research and development  product development and manufacturing activities  the extent and timing of costs of obtaining  enforcing and defending intellectual property rights  and any charges related to acquisitions 
because many of btg s expenses are fixed  particularly in the short term  any decrease in revenues will adversely affect btg s earnings until revenues can be increased or expenses reduced 
for example  in  the first five months of and the second half of  btg s revenues and earnings were adversely affected by gentiva s decision to reduce the amount of oxandrin inventory it carried 
see we are dependent on oxandrin sales 
because of fluctuations in revenues and expenses  it is possible btg s operating results for a particular quarter or quarters will not meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  causing the market price of btg common stock to decline 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance and stockholders should not rely on those comparisons to predict our future operating or share price performance 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to obtain any additional capital needed to operate and grow our business 
the development and commercialization of products requires a substantial amount of funds 
in addition  we may require cash to acquire businesses  products and or technologies 
our cash requirements are currently satisfied primarily through product sales 
historically  cash requirements were satisfied primarily through i product sales  ii funding of projects through collaborative research and development arrangements  iii contract fees  iv government of israel funding of a portion of certain research and development projects  mainly through the office of its chief scientist  and v equity and debt financings 
there can be no assurance that these financing alternatives will be available in the future to satisfy our cash requirements 
we believe that our current cash resources  together with anticipated product sales and continued funding from the chief scientist at current levels  will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations for the foreseeable future 
there can  however  be no assurance that product sales will occur as anticipated  that current agreements with third party distributors of our products will not be canceled  that the chief scientist will continue to provide funding at current levels  that we will not use a substantial portion of our cash resources to acquire businesses  products and or technologies  or that unanticipated events requiring the expenditure of funds will not occur 
the satisfaction of our future cash requirements will depend in large part on the status of commercialization of our products  our ability to enter into additional research and development and licensing arrangements  and our ability to obtain additional equity investments  if necessary 
there can be no assurance that btg will be able to obtain additional funds or  if such funds are available  that such funding will be on favorable terms 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities of btg  dilution to existing stockholders may result 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities or borrowings  btg may incur substantial interest expense and could become subject to financial and other covenants that could restrict our ability to operate our business 
if adequate funds are not available  btg may be required to significantly curtail one or more of its commercialization efforts or research and development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others on less favorable terms than might otherwise be available 
we are subject to stringent governmental regulation 
btg is subject to stringent regulation with respect to product safety and efficacy by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
of particular significance are the requirements covering research and development  testing  manufacturing  quality control  labeling and promotion of pharmaceutical products for human use 
all of btg s products  manufacturing processes and facilities require governmental licensing or approval prior to commercial use 
a pharmaceutical product cannot be marketed in the united states until it has been approved by the fda  and then can only be marketed for the indications and claims approved by the fda 
as a result of these requirements  the length of time  the level of expenditures and the laboratory and clinical information required for approval of an nda are substantial 
the approval process applicable to products of the type being developed by btg usually takes five to seven years from the commencement of human clinical trials and typically requires substantial expenditures 
btg and its licensees may encounter significant delays or excessive costs in their respective efforts to secure necessary approvals or licenses 
before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial sale of its products  btg is required to conduct pre clinical and clinical trials to demonstrate that the product is safe and efficacious for the treatment of the target disease 
the timing of completion of clinical trials is dependent upon a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
in addition  btg and its partners may encounter delays or rejections based upon changes in the policies of regulatory authorities 
future united states or foreign legislative or administrative acts could also prevent or delay regulatory approval of btg s or its licensees products 
failure to obtain requisite governmental approvals  or failure to obtain approvals of the scope requested  could delay or preclude btg or its licensees from marketing their products  could limit the commercial use of the products and could also allow competitors time to introduce competing products ahead of product introduction by btg and thereby have a material adverse effect on btg s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
even after regulatory approval is obtained  use of the products could reveal side effects that  if serious  could result in suspension of existing approvals and delays in obtaining approvals in other jurisdictions 
regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries is a significant factor affecting the timing of the commercialization of btg s products and its ongoing research and development activities 
the timing of regulatory approvals is not within our control 
to date  the length of time required to obtain regulatory approval of genetically engineered products has been significantly longer than expected  both for btg and the biotechnology industry in general 
these delays have had and  if they continue  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that these delays have in the past negatively impacted our ability to attract funding and that  as a result  the terms of such financings have been less favorable to us than they might otherwise have been had btg s product revenues provided sufficient funds to finance the large costs of taking a product from discovery through commercialization 
as a result  btg has had to license the commercialization of many of its products to third parties in exchange for research funding and royalties on product sales  this will result in lower revenues than if btg had commercialized the products on its own 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can  among other things  result in fines  suspension of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of products  imposition of operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions 
further  fda policy or similar policies of regulatory agencies in other countries may change and additional governmental requirements may be established that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products 
we are subject to uncertainties regarding healthcare reimbursement and reform 
btg s ability to successfully commercialize human therapeutic products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatment will be available from government health administration authorities  private health coverage insurers and other organizations 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products  and there can be no assurance that adequate third party coverage will be available for btg to maintain price levels sufficient for the realization of an appropriate return on its investment in product development 
government and other third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic products approved for marketing by the fda and by refusing  in some cases  to provide any coverage for use of approved products for disease indications for which the fda has not granted marketing approval 
if adequate coverage and reimbursement levels are not provided by government and third party payors for use of our healthcare products  the market acceptance of these products would be adversely affected 
in addition  in recent years a number of federal and state healthcare reform proposals have been introduced to contain healthcare costs 
there can be no assurance as to the ultimate content  timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation  nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of potential legislation on our business 
regulatory approval of prices is also required in most countries outside the united states 
in particular  certain european countries will condition their approval of a product on the agreement of the seller not to sell the product for more than a certain price in that country 
there can be no assurance that the establishment of a price in one european country will not have the practical effect of requiring our marketing partners to sell the product in other european countries at no higher than such price 
because btg generally supplies product to its marketing partners for a specified percentage of net sales  there can be no assurance that the resulting prices would be sufficient to generate an acceptable return on our investment in our products or even cover our manufacturing costs for such product 
we operate in a highly competitive market and our competitors may develop alternative technologies and products 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive  and the technological areas in which we work continue to evolve at a rapid pace 
our future success depends upon maintaining our ability to compete in the research  development and commercialization of products and technologies in our areas of focus 
competition from pharmaceutical  chemical and biotechnology companies  universities and research institutions is intense and expected to increase 
many of these competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and experience and manufacturing  marketing  financial and managerial resources than we do 
acquisitions of competing companies by large pharmaceutical companies or other companies could enhance the financial  marketing and other resources available to these competitors 
our competitors may develop products that are superior to those we are developing 
rapid technological development may result in our products or processes becoming obsolete before marketing of these products or before we recover a significant portion of the research  development and commercialization expenses incurred with respect to those products 
our products must compete with others to gain market acceptance and market share 
an important factor will be the timing of market introduction of competitive products 
accordingly  the relative speed with which we and competing companies can develop products  complete the clinical testing and approval processes  and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market will be an important element of market success 
significant competitive factors include capabilities of our collaborators  product efficacy and safety  timing and scope of regulatory approval  product availability  marketing and sale capabilities  reimbursement coverage from insurance companies and others  the amount of clinical benefit of our product candidates relative to their cost  the method of administering a product  price  and patent protection 
our competitors may develop more effective or more affordable products or achieve earlier product development completion  patent protection  regulatory approval or product commercialization than we do 
our competitors achievement of any of these goals could have a material adverse effect on our business 
these companies also compete with btg to attract qualified personnel and to attract third parties for acquisitions  joint ventures or other collaborations 
we may be unable to obtain and retain skilled personnel 
we are dependent upon the efforts of our officers  scientists and other employees 
the loss of certain of these key employees could materially and adversely affect our business 
our business is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified research and managerial personnel 
there is a great deal of competition for the limited number of scientists with expertise in the area of btg s operations 
we do not maintain  and have no current intention of obtaining  key man life insurance on any of our employees 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in hiring or retaining the personnel we require for continued growth 
our failure to hire and retain such personnel could materially adversely affect our business 
our business may be adversely affected by developments in israel 
btg s primary research  development and production activities are at this time conducted in israel by its wholly owned subsidiary btg israel and can be affected by economic  military and political conditions in that country and in the middle east in general 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors and a state of hostility  which varies in degree and intensity  has caused security and economic problems in israel 
any major hostilities involving israel could adversely affect our research  development and production operations  which would harm our business 
we cannot assure you that ongoing or revived hostilities related to israel will not have a material adverse affect on us or our business and on our share price 
despite the progress towards peace between israel and its arab neighbors  the future of these peace efforts is uncertain 
in addition  since october  there has been a significant increase in violence  primarily in the west bank and gaza strip 
during the course of military operations  israel s military reserves  which include a number of our employees and executives  may be called up  which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 
as a result of the current violence in israel  the fda has suspended inspections of manufacturing facilities in israel 
products we intend to manufacture at our newly constructed manufacturing facility cannot be shipped into the united states until the fda has inspected and approved this facility 
we do not currently intend to transfer our manufacturing activities to our newly constructed manufacturing facility until the fda has inspected and approved the new facility 
continued suspension of these activities by the fda will delay the commencement of manufacturing at our new facility  which could adversely affect our business 
the suspension of fda inspections has delayed inspection of the contract sterilizer utilized by btg for its biolon product  which has required us to stop shipping biolon to the united states until the facility is inspected or btg qualifies a new contract sterilizer 
btg manages its israeli operations with the objective of protecting against any material net financial loss in us dollars from the impact of israeli inflation and currency devaluations on its non us dollar assets and liabilities 
the cost of btg s operations in israel  as expressed in dollars  is influenced by the extent to which any increase in the rate of inflation in israel is not offset or is offset on a lagging basis by a devaluation of the israeli shekel in relation to the us dollar 
the rate of inflation as measured by the consumer price index in israel was approximately in  while the shekel was devalued by less than 
in there was no change in the consumer price index and the shekel s value in relation to the us dollar increased by approximately 
in the inflation rate was approximately while the shekel was devalued by 
as a result  for those expenses linked to the israeli shekel  such as salaries and rent  this resulted in corresponding increases in these costs in us dollar terms in and however  in  for those expenses this resulted in corresponding decreases in these costs in us dollar terms 
to the extent that expenses in shekels exceed btg s revenues in shekels which to date have consisted primarily of research funding from the chief scientist and product sales in israel  the devaluations of israeli currency have been and will continue to be a benefit to btg s financial condition 
however  should btg s revenues in shekels exceed its expenses in shekels in any material respect  the devaluation of the shekel will adversely affect btg s financial condition 
further  to the extent the devaluation of the shekel with respect to the us dollar does not substantially offset the increase in the costs of local goods and services in israel  btg s financial results will be adversely affected as local expenses measured in us dollars will increase 
we may incur substantial product liability 
the testing and marketing of btg s products entail an inherent risk of product liability and associated adverse publicity 
pharmaceutical product liability exposure could be extremely large and pose a material risk 
although btg has so far been able to obtain indemnification from pharmaceutical companies commercializing its products  there can be no assurance that other such companies will agree in the future to indemnify btg for other of btg s products or that such companies will  if obligated to do so  have adequate resources to fulfill their indemnity agreements 
further  to the extent btg elects to test or market products independently  it will bear the risk of product liability directly 
btg presently has  of product liability insurance coverage in place 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain existing insurance or obtain additional insurance on acceptable terms  or at all 
it is possible that a single product liability claim could exceed our insurance coverage limits  and multiple claims are possible 
any successful product liability claim made against btg could substantially reduce or eliminate any stockholders equity btg may have and could have a significant adverse impact on btg s business 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market prices for securities of biopharmaceutical companies  including btg  have been volatile  and it is likely that the price of our common stock will fluctuate in the future 
factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by btg or its competitors  announcements by btg or its competitors of results in pre clinical testing and clinical trials  governmental regulation  patent or proprietary rights developments  public concern as to the safety or other implications of biotechnology products  changes in earnings estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  period to period fluctuations in financial results and market conditions in general may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
the stock market has also experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of the securities of biopharmaceutical companies  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies 
if we face such litigation in the future  it would result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our business 
in addition  the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected by future exercises of outstanding options and the issuance of common stock in acquisitions of businesses  products and or technologies 
at december  options to purchase an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock were outstanding 
a substantial portion of these options have exercise prices below the current market price of the common stock 
additionally  all of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of these outstanding options have been registered under the securities act of  as amended  and  accordingly  when issued will be freely tradable without restriction 
the sale of a significant amount of these shares at one time could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  btg may issue additional stock  warrants and or options to raise capital or complete acquisitions in the future 
btg may also issue additional securities in connection with its employee benefit plans 
during the terms of such options and warrants  the holders thereof are given the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of the common stock 
the exercise of such options and warrants may have an adverse effect on the market value of the common stock 
the existence of such options and warrants may adversely affect the terms on which btg can obtain additional equity financing 
to the extent the exercise prices of such options and warrants are less than the net tangible book value of the common stock at the time such options and warrants are exercised  btg s stockholders will experience an immediate dilution in the net tangible book value of their investment 
further  the future sale of a substantial number of shares of common stock by existing stockholders and option holders may have an adverse impact on the market price of the common stock 
see item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
effecting a change of control of btg could be difficult  which may discourage offers for shares of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and the delaware general corporation law contain provisions that may delay or prevent an attempt by a third party to acquire control of us 
these provisions include the requirements of section of the delaware general corporation law 
in general  section prohibits designated types of business combinations  including mergers  for a period of three years between us and any third party that owns or more of our common stock 
this provision does not apply if our board of directors approves of the transaction before the third party acquires of our stock  the third party acquires at least of our stock at the time its ownership goes past the level  or our board of directors and two thirds of the shares of our common stock not held by the third party vote in favor of the transaction 
we have also adopted a stockholder rights plan intended to deter hostile or coercive attempts to acquire us 
under the plan  if any person or group acquires more than of our common stock without approval of the board of directors under specified circumstances  our other stockholders have the right to purchase shares of our common stock  or shares of the acquiring company  at a substantial discount to the public market price 
the plan thus makes an acquisition much more costly to a potential acquirer 
our certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more different series with terms fixed by the board of directors 
stockholder approval is not necessary to issue preferred stock in this manner 
issuance of these shares of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a person or group to acquire control of us 
no shares of our preferred stock are currently outstanding 
while our board of directors has no current intentions or plans to issue any preferred stock  issuance of these shares could also be used as an anti takeover device

in addition  btg leases approximately  square feet in new york city for its business activities  including its investor and public relations activities 
this lease expires in september we also lease approximately  square feet of space in san diego  california  where our recently acquired prosaptide research is being conducted 
this lease expires in october btg s research  development and manufacturing facility is located in rehovot  israel  where btg leases approximately  square feet at an annual rental of approximately  this lease expires in december although we believe our space is suitable and adequate for our current activities  we determined that we will require a new  larger manufacturing facility in israel within the next several years to meet anticipated increased demand for our products and increased regulatory requirements 
accordingly  in april btg purchased a building in israel located approximately miles south of its current facility for approximately million 
construction of a modern production facility meeting fda gmp requirements for drugs  biologics and devices was completed at the end of  and qualification activities have been commenced and are expected to be completed in the second half of btg will initially locate its production activities for fibrimage at this new facility  and will thereafter move the remainder of its production activities to this facility

item legal proceedings on december   genentech filed a lawsuit against btg in the united states district court for the district of delaware alleging that btg s importation of hgh produced according to its original expression system infringed two genentech process patents 
in january  btg commenced an action against genentech in the united states district court for the southern district of new york the us district court seeking  among other things  declaratory judgments as to the non infringement  invalidity and unenforceability of certain genentech patents 
the delaware action was consolidated with the new york action  and in august the us district court granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting the commercial introduction in the united states of btg s hgh pending the outcome of the patent infringement action 
the us court of appeals for the federal circuit cafc rejected btg s appeal of the grant of the preliminary injunction  and the united states supreme court denied btg s petition for a writ of certiorari 
two of the genentech patents originally at issue have expired  and only a third patent of genentech  expiring in july  remains in issue 
the action in the us district court was tried in january and the us district court found that the remaining genentech patent was invalid and vacated the preliminary injunction 
following genentech s appeal  which was heard in december  the cafc reversed the district court s decision in september  reinstated the preliminary injuction and remanded the issue of infringement to the district court for further proceedings 
btg petitioned the cafc for a rehearing en banc  which was denied in december btg and genentech have settled this dispute  and a modified injunction has been issued which precludes btg from importing or selling in the united states its hgh product produced according to its original expression system during the remaining life of this genentech patent  however  this should not preclude btg from marketing hgh manufactured using a new expression system for which btg obtained fda approval in september  subject to the outcome of the patent dispute with novo nordisk discussed below 
we cannot assure you that genentech will not claim that our new expression system violates its patent that expires in and seek an injunction to prevent our using the new expression system to produce hgh for teva 
see item business products and applications bio tropin human growth hormone 
three patent applications of genentech in israel  which cover general methods relating to genetically engineered products and to human growth hormone  have been allowed two in and one in btg opposed the grant of all these patents 
two of these patent applications expired during without ever being granted 
the third  which expired in june  corresponds to the us patent that was invalidated by the us district court in january procedurally  hearings before the israel registrar of patents took place during regarding the third patent application and summations and replies were subsequently filed 
btg filed a motion in december requesting that the registrar strike out genentech s patent application due to its expiration and rule that the matter should no longer be heard 
a decision is pending 
there can be no assurance that btg will be successful in its opposition to the grant of this now expired patent application 
if btg is unsuccessful in its opposition in israel the patent may be deemed effective and genentech may sue for infringement 
in september  jcr received a letter from attorneys representing genentech and its licensee  kabi pharmacia  claiming that jcr s sale of btg s hgh infringed certain genentech patents and patent applications and demanding that jcr cease the sale of btg s hgh in japan 
jcr and btg have filed oppositions to five genentech patent applications in japan  oppositions with respect to four of these patent applications were denied but the fifth was successful  which resulted in that patent application being revoked during we do not believe that we are infringing or have ever infringed any valid genentech patent or patent application  but there can be no assurance that our hgh will not be found to infringe certain genentech patents in japan  the latest of which expired in july  or any patents issued pursuant to pending patent applications  the latest of which expired in april if btg s hgh is found to infringe certain genentech patents in japan  jcr and or btg may be obligated to pay damages with respect to sales made while the patents were in effect 
sales of hgh to jcr in  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of btg s total product sales in those periods and  and  respectively  of btg s total hgh product sales in those periods 
in novo was issued a us patent for a biosynthetic ripe human growth hormone free of contaminants from pituitary derived human growth hormone 
at btg s request  the united states patent office board of patent appeals and interferences the patent office in declared an interference to determine whether btg  rather than novo  should hold the patent for biosynthetic ripe human growth hormone on the basis that btg scientists  not novo scientists  were the first to invent 
the patent office has ruled in favor of novo  and btg intends to commence an action in federal court seeking a determination that btg scientists were the first to invent 
should btg not be awarded priority  btg could be precluded from marketing in the united states hgh produced using this new expression system 
during  btg received notification from the patent office of the declaration of an interference between an issued patent assigned to btg covering a method for producing enzymatically active human copper zinc sod in bacteria and a pending application of chiron corporation chiron  which claims an earlier filing date 
subsequent to the interference being declared  chiron was issued a us patent for the bacterially produced form of recombinant human copper zinc sod 
at btg s request  the patent office in declared a second interference to determine whether btg rather than chiron should hold the patent for the bacterially produced form of recombinant human copper zinc sod on the basis that btg scientists  not chiron scientists  invented the method for producing recombinant human copper zinc sod in bacteria 
the patent office determined in the first interference that chiron s claims were unpatentable but that chiron had an earlier invention date and that btg is not entitled to the claims of its existing us patent 
in the second interference the patent office found that chiron has the earlier invention date and is entitled to keep its us patent and that btg is not entitled to a patent 
in december  btg and chiron entered into a cross license agreement to resolve the interference actions in the patent office  as well as a patent opposition in israel 
btg believes that as a result of the cross license agreement chiron s patents are no longer a barrier to the commercialization of btg s human copper zinc sod product in the united states 
however  the existence of this cross license does not necessarily assure btg s ability to commercialize its oxsodrol product

in september  we received a letter from biogen stating that it believed that our recombinant surface antigen of the hepatitis b virus  which is an active ingredient of our bio hep b vaccine  or the intermediates for the process of making such antigen  falls within the claims of one or more of biogen s patents and or patent applications 
we made inquiries of biogen and smithkline beecham the exclusive licensee of all of biogen s hepatitis b patents except those in japan requesting that btg be granted a license to the biogen patents  however  such efforts were not successful 
we obtained a compulsory license under biogen s israeli patent to manufacture our bio hep b vaccine in israel  however  this license expired  and the related litigation was terminated  following the expiration of biogen s israeli patent 
we are now able to manufacture and sell bio hep b in israel 
see item business products and applications bio hep b hepatitis b vaccine 
we have been advised by scigen  our bio hep b licensee in certain countries in the far east  that in april biogen initiated suit against scigen in singapore asserting that scigen s conduct of clinical trials in singapore with respect to our hepatitis b vaccine constitutes infringement of biogen s patent rights in singapore and claiming rights in the data obtained by scigen through its clinical trials in singapore and that an interlocutory hearing was held in september scigen notified btg that the application for the injunction was dismissed by the high court in september  but biogen has not withdrawn its case against scigen in singapore 
biogen s singapore patent rights are based on the registration of its corresponding uk patents  and the validity of patents in singapore depends on the validity of the corresponding uk patents 
biogen s broad uk patent was invalidated by the uk court of appeals in october the house of lords upheld this decision in october  although biogen had claims of a more limited scope allowed to the same patent 
additionally  three claims of a narrower uk patent were upheld 
we believe that none of these claims will affect commercialization of our vaccine  although there can be no assurance of this 
we are aware of certain other patents that have been granted or are pending and which  if granted  may prevent us from selling our vaccine in the united states  europe and certain other countries 
btg s failure to obtain any needed license  or a determination that its vaccine infringes the patent rights of biogen or others  would substantially limit  if not prohibit  the commercialization of the bio hep b vaccine in those countries in which biogen or others have a patent until such patent is revoked or expires 
our ability to secure any necessary licenses or sublicenses to these patents or applications cannot be predicted 
we are aware of patent applications filed by  or patents issued to  other entities with respect to technology potentially useful to us and  in some cases  related to products and processes being developed by us 
we cannot presently assess the effect  if any  that these patents may have on our operations 
the extent to which efforts by other researchers have resulted or will result in patents and the extent to which the issuance of patents to others would have a materially adverse effect on btg or would force btg to obtain licenses from others is currently unknown

in  solchem  a former affiliate and manufacturing arm of spa  filed a declaratory judgment action against btg in the united states district court of new jersey seeking a determination that it is not a party to btg s agreement with spa  which binds affiliates of spa  and therefore not bound by the non compete and free to sell oxandrolone to mutual pharmaceutical  a generic drug manufacturer 
btg counterclaimed against solchem and mutual  although the claims against mutual were dismissed 
the litigation with solchem and mutual was settled in early  with solchem essentially agreeing to comply with the non compete in spa s agreement with btg  which expires october  btg is currently in a dispute with serono laboratories  inc serono labs relating to a co promotion agreement pursuant to which btg undertook to promote in the united states through gentiva serono labs recombinant human growth hormone  saizen  for the treatment of children with growth failure due to inadequate levels of growth hormone 
the agreement proved to be commercially infeasible and btg terminated the agreement in june serono is contesting btg s termination of that agreement in and asserting that a non compete provision  which btg maintains expired in mid and in any case should not apply to teva  if it is applicable at all  should continue until april  in march  btg filed a lawsuit in new jersey to confirm btg s position on these issues 
serono labs has commenced an action against btg in massachusetts to enforce the agreement 
the new jersey court denied serono labs motion to dismiss the new jersey action and enjoined serono labs from pursuing its action in massachusetts 
the new jersey court also denied btg s motion for summary judgment 
if serono labs prevails in the litigation  teva could be precluded from distributing btg s hgh in the united states until after april  in btg accrued approximately  of commissions received by it from gentiva in respect of saizen  which btg subsequently returned because gentiva  which was unable to sell most of the product before it expired  returned the product to serono

in  duramed pharmaceuticals  inc filed an abbreviated new drug application anda with the fda seeking approval of a generic version of mircette 
pursuant to its license agreement with organon  btg has commenced a patent infringement suit against duramed  which was subsequently acquired by barr laboratories 
in december the court granted barr s motion for summary judgment of non infringement of btg s patent 
btg has appealed this decision 
if the patent is held not to be infringed  organon may assert that it is no longer required to pay btg royalties on the sale of mircette  and generic competition for mircette will likely impact sales of mircette and  therefore  royalties to btg

the revenue projection used to value the in process research and development was based on estimates of relevant market size and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by btg and its competitors 
the resulting net cash flows from such product are based on management s estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses and income taxes from such product 
btg believes that the assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of the merger 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such product  will transpire as estimated 
for these reasons  actual results may vary from projected results 
the most significant and uncertain assumptions relating to the in process research and development relate to the ability to successfully develop a product and the projected timing of completion of  and revenues attributable to  that product 
investment in omrix biopharmaceuticals  inc in january  in order to obtain a period of exclusivity to negotiate a possible strategic relationship with omrix biopharmaceuticals  inc omrix  btg loaned  to omrix and agreed to convert the loan into  and to purchase an additional  of  shares of omrix preferred stock if it did not pursue a relationship 
btg determined not to pursue a strategic relationship with omrix  and on march  converted the existing loan into  and purchased an additional  of  shares of omrix preferred stock  which is convertible into approximately of omrix common stock on a fully diluted basis 
omrix is a privately held company that develops and markets a unique surgical sealant and a number of immunology products based on blood plasma processing technology 
omrix currently sells its products in europe  south america and the middle east 
during the fourth quarter of  btg determined that the decline in the value of its investment in omrix was other than temporary and  accordingly  wrote down the value of this investment by  based on management s evaluation of current market conditions and omrix s operations and forecasts 
outlook we currently anticipate total revenues  excluding interest income  of at least million 
although we also anticipate growth in total product sales  we expect the growth in sales of oxandrin to be partially offset by a lower level of human growth hormone sales in as compared to due in part to industry wide pricing pressures in japan by the japanese health ministry and jcr s management of inventory levels  the level of sales of our human growth hormone to jcr for the japanese market will be adversely affected  despite an increasing market share 
based on wholesaler orders through february  revenues from delatestryl sales are currently anticipated to exceed those of royalty revenues may fall below their level due to potential generic competition for mircette 
in order to optimize the maturation of our proprietary pipeline products  we are committing significant additional resources to them in research and development expense is consequently expected to increase by approximately compared to additionally  to fully maximize oxandrin s potential and provide stimulus to its growth  marketing and sales expenses are expected to grow this year by approximately 
given this significant investment in our future growth  the increase in expenses is anticipated to outpace revenue growth and therefore we are expecting full year eps to be below that of pro forma eps and possibly below pro forma eps 
our eps will depend in significant measure on the growth in oxandrin prescriptions and the sales achieved by both ross and btg 
in addition  acquisition activities could affect our eps 
we expect our quarterly eps in to vary based on the timing of product sales to customers and research and development and marketing expenses 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows investments 
we from time to time invest in nonmarketable equity securities for strategic purposes 
these investments are carried at cost 
we periodically monitor the liquidity progress and financing activities of these entities to determine if impairment write downs are required 
in  we wrote down our investment in omrix by  write off of in process research and development acquired 
in connection with our acquisition of myelos corporation  we allocated  to in process research and development projects of myelos  representing the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows of the acquired technology 
we expensed this value as of the acquisition date because the technology was not fully commercially developed and had no alternative future uses 
income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their basis for income tax purposes and the tax effects of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances  and at december   did not record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
if we determine in the future that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets  adjustments will be charged to income in the period that we made such determination 
bad debts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
litigation 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings referred to in the commitments and contingencies note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we do not believe these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  were an unfavorable ruling to occur in any quarterly period  there exists the possibility of a material impact on the operating results 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page of this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the fiscal periods indicated the percentage of our revenues represented by certain items reflected on our consolidated statements of operations

we anticipate that product sales will constitute the majority of our revenues in the future 
revenues have in the past displayed and will in the immediate future continue to display significant variations due to changes in demand for our products  new product introductions by btg and its competitors  the obtaining of new research and development contracts and licensing arrangements  the completion or termination of such contracts and arrangements  the timing and amounts of milestone payments  and the timing of regulatory approvals of products 
the following table summarizes btg s sales of its commercialized products as a percentage of total product sales for the periods indicated year ended december  oxandrin bio tropin biolon delatestryl other total we believe that our product mix will vary from period to period based on the purchasing patterns of our customers and our focus on i increasing market penetration of its existing products  ii expanding into new markets  and iii commercializing additional products 
quarterly fluctuations in sales of oxandrin have had a significant impact on our quarterly results of operations 
quarterly sales of oxandrin in  and are set forth in the following table first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total in thousands our sales of oxandrin consist of sales to gentiva health services  inc gentiva  our wholesale and retail distributor of oxandrin in the united states  and the ross products division of abbott laboratories 
the decrease in oxandrin sales in the second half of was due to the oxandrin inventory reduction that gentiva began in april as a result of a slowing in the rate of increase in oxandrin prescriptions 
the increase in oxandrin sales in each of the last three quarters of was due to gentiva s completion  in may  of this oxandrin inventory reduction 
the increase in oxandrin sales during the first half of was due to i the commencement  in september  of sales by the ross products division of abbott laboratories for the long term care market for the treatment of patients with involuntary weight loss  including stocking activity by wholesalers in connection with the launch of this product in the long term care market  ii stocking by certain wholesalers in anticipation of a price increase  iii increased purchases by gentiva following its completion  in may  of a reduction in the amount of oxandrin inventory it carries  which reduction began in april  and iv increased wholesaler sales of oxandrin by gentiva 
upon completion of its inventory reduction in may  gentiva began to purchase  on a monthly basis  an amount of oxandrin equal to the average end user ie  wholesaler sales during the preceding three months 
however  because of the significant increase in oxandrin purchases by wholesalers in the first quarter of in anticipation of a price increase and in connection with the launch of oxandrin into the long term care market  gentiva s purchases of oxandrin in the second quarter of were higher than the levels of its sales of oxandrin to wholesalers in that period 
as a result  gentiva s inventory of oxandrin increased beyond the desired level 
accordingly  btg and gentiva amended their distribution arrangement effective august to provide for reduced purchases of oxandrin until gentiva s inventory was reduced to desired levels and thereafter to ensure that sales of oxandrin by btg to gentiva more accurately reflected end user demand 
as a result  sales of oxandrin in the second half of were  lower than in the first half of and  lower than in the second half of gentiva s reduction in oxandrin inventory adversely affected the growth in btg s product sales and revenues and btg s results of operations in and reductions in wholesaler purchases of oxandrin from gentiva in the second  third and fourth quarters of and significantly reduced purchases of oxandrin by gentiva in the second half of adversely affected the growth in btg s product sales and revenues and btg s results of operations in the second half of because purchases by wholesalers fluctuate from month to month and quarter to quarter based on their own operating strategies including desired levels of inventories  purchases by their customers and stocking in advance of anticipated price increases  btg s sales to gentiva and ross will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
there can be no assurance that gentiva will not determine to further reduce its oxandrin inventory levels 
the launch of oxandrin in late by ross into the long term sector for the treatment of patients with involuntary weight loss led to a increase in prescriptions in compared to however  prescriptions in the second half of  although higher than in the second half of  were below prescriptions in the first half of  due  at least in part  to sales force changes in the long term care sector 
the ross long term care field force contingent detailing physicians  nursing homes  assisted living facilities and geriatric hospitals was streamlined in the spring of in an effort to achieve greater efficiency 
btg believes this may have resulted in a reduction in the number of oxandrin calls and details being made 
btg understands that corrective measures have been taken to increase the number of calls and details being made 
to date the average prescription written for the long term care market involves a significantly lower dose of oxandrin than the average prescription written for the aids market 
the following table summarizes btg s united states and international product sales as a percentage of total product sales for the periods indicated year ended december  domestic foreign total domestic sales as a percentage of total product sales has fluctuated due primarily to a reduction in purchases of oxandrin by btg s distributor in the us from april through may and increased sales of oxandrin to btg s distributor in the us in the second half of and the first half of comparison of years ended december   and revenues 
revenues in increased to  from  in  which represented a slight decrease from  in product sales increased in to  from  in  which itself was a slight decrease from product sales of  the changes in revenues between  and were primarily driven by changes in product sales  principally oxandrin  and contract fees 
sales of oxandrin in  and were approximately   and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of btg s total product sales in those periods 
sales of oxandrin to gentiva in  and were   and  net  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of btg s total sales of oxandrin 
in sales of oxandrin increased  or  from sales 
sales of oxandrin increased  in the first half of  due to i the commencement  in september  of sales by the ross products division of abbott laboratories for the long term care market for the treatment of patients with involuntary weight loss  including stocking activity by wholesalers in connection with the launch of this product in the long term care market  ii stocking by certain wholesalers in anticipation of a price increase  iii increased purchases by gentiva following its completion  in may  of a reduction in the amount of oxandrin inventory it carries  which reduction began in april  and iv increased wholesaler sales of oxandrin by gentiva 
sales of oxandrin in the second half of decreased  from the comparable period in due to gentiva s increased purchases of oxandrin in the second half of following completion of its inventory reduction and decreased purchases in the second half of to reduce inventory 
in sales of oxandrin increased  or  as gentiva completed the reduction in the amount of oxandrin inventory it carries in may the decrease in sales to gentiva in was partially offset by  of sales of oxandrin to third parties for distribution overseas 
sales of hgh in  and were approximately   and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of btg s total product sales in those periods 
sales of human growth hormone increased in by  or  over sales 
sales of human growth hormone increased in by  or  over sales 
the increase in sales of hgh in and was mainly due to increased sales to jcr and ferring 
sales of hgh to jcr in  and were approximately   and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of btg s total product sales in those periods and  and  respectively  of btg s total hgh sales in those periods 
sales of hgh to the ferring group were approximately   and  in  and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of btg s total product sales in those periods and  and  respectively  of btg s total hgh sales in those periods 
sales of delatestryl and biolon increased in by  and  or and  respectively  from levels 
in sales of delatestryl and biolon decreased  and  or and  respectively  from levels 
we had no sales of delatestryl in the second and third quarters of delatestryl sales increased substantially in when the fda stopped the production of a competing injectable testosterone product used to treat men with hypogonadism testosterone deficiency 
the decrease in sales of delatestryl in relates to gentiva s election to reduce its delatestryl inventory in anticipation of the fda s again permitting the production of the competing injectable testosterone product 
increased sales of delatestryl in resulted from the fact that the fda has yet to approve production of this competing product 
the decrease in sales of biolon in was primarily the result of a halt in product shipments to the us beginning in the first quarter of pending fda approval of a supplemental application relating to an upgrade in btg s manufacturing process to conform it to a higher standard of quality implemented by btg 
btg resumed shipments to the us in the first quarter of  although shipments again stopped in the fourth quarter of as the fda has not been able to inspect the new manufacturing facility of btg s contract sterilizer for biolon due to the violence in israel 
for the year ended december  contract fees were  which represent contract fees received in prior periods but recognized in in accordance with sab for the years ended december  and  contract fees  which consist of licensing and option to license fees  amounting to  and  or and  respectively  of total revenues  were earned from certain of btg s collaborative partners 
of the contract fees earned in   or of total contract fees  was earned in respect of arthrease   or of total contract fees  was earned as a milestone payment under btg s strategic alliance with teva focusing on the development and global commercialization of several generic recombinant therapeutic products and the license of distribution rights in the united states for btg s hgh  and  or of total contract fees  was earned in respect of the bio hep b vaccine 
under sab  contract fees in include  of contract fees paid in prior periods  or of total contract fees 
of the contract fees earned in   or of total contract fees  was earned in respect of btg s strategic alliance with teva  and  or of total contract fees  was earned in respect of the license of distribution rights for insulin on a substantially worldwide basis 
approximately  of the contract fees earned in have been included in the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
on a pro forma basis as if sab had been in effect since january   contract fees in would have been  or of total revenues 
royalties in  and consist mainly of net royalties in respect of the mircette product in the amount of   and  respectively 
other revenues consist primarily of funding from the chief scientist  which represented  and of other revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in interest income increased only slightly  as the total of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased  from december  to december  the decreased cash balances including short term investment resulted mainly from the use of approximately  net to acquire myelos  the use of approximately  to fund construction of the company s new manufacturing facility in and the use of  to purchase shares of omrix  partially offset by cash flow from operations  proceeds from the exercise of options and proceeds from a  loan borrowed to finance construction of the company s new manufacturing facility in israel 
the increase in interest income in was derived primarily from an increase in cash balances resulting from option exercises and cash flow from operations in research and development expense 
expenditures for research and development were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenditures in resulted mainly from the increase in research and development personnel and legal fees related to patent maintenance and patent interference proceedings  as well as the addition of research and development activities for prosaptide following the acquisition of myelos 
the increase in research and development expenditures in was mainly due to the increase in research and development personnel and other expenses associated with these additional personnel  partially offset by a decreased level of grants by btg for clinical studies 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales was   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales was  and in  and  respectively 
cost of product sales in increased in absolute terms as a result of increased product sales 
cost of product sales in decreased  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenues  primarily as a result of increased sales of oxandrin and decreased sales of delatestryl and biolon 
oxandrin has a relatively low cost of manufacture as a percentage of product sales  while biolon has the highest cost to manufacture as a percentage of product sales 
cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales varies from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the quantity and mix of products sold 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in resulted from the amortization of  of negative goodwill resulting from the myelos acquisition 
on a pro forma basis to exclude the effect of the amortization of negative goodwill  general and administrative expense for was  an increase of from the comparable period in the increase in general and administrative expense excluding the effect of the amortization of negative goodwill was primarily due to increased compensation costs  partially offset by a decrease in legal fees litigation as compared to  when legal fees increased primarily due to the reactivation in the fourth quarter of of the company s declaratory judgment action against genentech in respect of the company s human growth hormone product in the united states 
the decrease in resulted mainly from the fact that expenses include the write off of other assets relating to the development of androtab sl  a sublingual testosterone product for the treatment of hypogonadism  as a result of our decision not to continue to pursue fda approval of androtab sl 
marketing and sales expense 
marketing and sales expense was   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
these expenses primarily related to the sales and marketing force in the united states that btg established principally in the second half of and during to promote distribution of oxandrin in the united states 
the decrease in marketing and sales expense in compared to last year derived mainly from decreased advertising  promotional and market research activities  partially offset by increased compensation costs 
the increase in was primarily due to additional marketing and sales expenses  primarily resulting from increased personnel and increased advertising  promotional and market research activities  arising from the growth of btg s product sales 
commissions and royalties 
commissions and royalties were   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
these expenses consist primarily of royalties to entities from which btg licensed certain of its products and to the chief scientist 
commissions and royalties in included  net of commissions received in respect of serono s sales of its human growth hormone to gentiva  which commissions we subsequently refunded because gentiva was unable to sell most of serono s human growth hormone product before it expired 
realized and unrealize loss on investment and other financing expense 
in we recognized realized and unrealized capital losses of  on short term investments that were liquidated in december and january since january   we earned in excess of  on these investments 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that the decline in the value of our investment in omrix was other than temporary and  accordingly  wrote down the value of this  investment by  based on management s evaluation of current market conditions and omrix s operations and forecasts 
write off of in process research and development acquired 
in btg wrote off  as in process research and development acquired relating to the acquisition of myelos corporation 
in connection with the acquisition btg allocated  to in process research and development projects of myelos  representing the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows of the acquired technology based on an independent valuation 
at the date of the merger the technology acquired in the acquisition was not fully commercially developed and had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the value was expensed as of the acquisition date 
income taxes 
provision for income taxes for the years ended december   and was   and  respectively  representing approximately on a pro forma basis excluding the write off of in process research and development acquired and amortization of negative goodwill  which are not taken into account in computing income taxes  and of income before income taxes 
btg s consolidated tax rate differs from the statutory rate because of israeli tax benefits  research and experimental tax credits  state and local taxes and similar items that affect the tax rate 
in btg recorded a provision for additional taxes as a result of a tax audit that btg israel is currently undergoing covering the through tax years 
earnings per common share 
btg had approximately million additional basic weighted average shares outstanding for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the increased number of basic shares was primarily the result of the issuance in of shares upon the exercise of options and the issuance of approximately million shares to the former shareholders of myelos in march for diluted weighted average shares outstanding does not include dilutive securities because the effect would be anti dilutive 
on a pro forma basis  excluding the write off of in process research and development acquired  amortization of negative goodwill  the realization of capital losses on short term investments and the partial write off of the omrix investment  net income would have been  or per share on both a basic and diluted share basis 
diluted weighted average shares outstanding would have been  an increase of approximately million shares from  primarily as a result of the higher basic weighted average shares outstanding for  partially offset by the fact that less outstanding options were considered common equivalents because their exercise price was above the average fair market value of the common stock for  which average fair market value was lower than in the same period last year 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
effective january   btg adopted sab as a result of adopting sab  btg changed the way it recognizes revenue from contract fees for the license of marketing and distribution rights where the consideration is a one time nonrefundable payment 
prior to the issuance of sab  btg recorded revenue from the license of marketing and distribution rights when the rights were licensed and or when these payments were received 
effective january   btg recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to contract revenues recognized in prior years in the amount of  net of income taxes of  of which  was recognized as contract fee revenue in the related revenues are now being recognized over the term of the related agreements 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital at december   was  as compared to  at december  the decrease in working capital at december  was primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable as btg shortened the average terms of payment to its customers 
our cash flows have fluctuated significantly due to the impact of net income  capital spending  working capital requirements  the issuance of common stock and other financing activities 
btg expects that cash flows in the near future will be primarily determined by the levels of net income  working capital requirements  and financings  if any  undertaken by btg 
net cash increased by   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the large increase in was primarily due to the sale of short term investments 
net cash provided by operating activities was   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
net loss income was   and  in the same periods  respectively 
in we had net cash provided by operating activities despite the net loss  mainly due to the write off of in process research and development acquired of  a decrease in accounts receivable of  an unrealized loss on investments  net of  an increase in accounts payable of  depreciation and amortization of  and a realized loss on the sale of short term investments  net of  partially offset by an increase in inventories of  an increase in deferred income tax of  amortization of negative goodwill of  and deferred revenues of  in net cash provided by operating activities was greater than net income  mainly due to the cumulative effect of the accounting change resulting from the adoption of sab of  net of income taxes due to sab and depreciation and amortization of  partially offset by an increase in deferred income taxes  inventories and accounts receivable of   and  respectively 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in  investing activities included capital expenditures of   and  in these periods  respectively  consisting of approximately   and  respectively  for the purchase and reconstruction of a new manufacturing facility  with the remainder in all periods primarily for laboratory and manufacturing equipment and infrastructure 
in  net cash used in investing activities also includes the  investment in omrix and  net used in connection with the acquisition of myelos 
the remainder of the net cash used in investing activities  in all periods  was primarily for purchases and sales of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash flows from financing activities in were primarily affected by long term borrowings of  and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of  cash flows from financing activities in and were primarily affected by net proceeds from issuances of common stock of  and  respectively  in these periods 
net proceeds from the sale of common stock resulted mainly from option exercises 
in april  btg purchased a manufacturing facility in israel for approximately  construction of a modern production facility meeting fda gmp requirements for drugs  biologics and devices was completed at the end of  and qualification activities have been commenced and are expected to be completed in the second half of btg will initially locate its production activities for fibrimage at this new facility  and will thereafter move the remainder of its production activities to this facility 
we expect it will cost approximately  to complete the production facility excluding the cost of purchasing the facility  of which approximately  had been expended through december  at december   btg had outstanding commitments of  related to completion of this facility 
in addition  btg has agreed to purchase additional property adjacent to the new manufacturing facility for approximately  of which approximately  has been paid to date 
this property will allow btg to locate its principal research and development activities adjacent to our new manufacturing facility 
in june btg israel entered into a  revolving credit facility with bank hapoalim bm to finance a portion of the cost of completing its new manufacturing facility 
short term borrowings under the facility are due months from the date of borrowing and long term borrowings are due five years from the date of borrowing 
loans under the facility bear interest at the rate of libor plus in the case of short term borrowings and libor plus in the case of long term borrowings 
amounts repaid under the facility can be reborrowed 
the credit facility is secured by the assets of btg israel and has been guaranteed by the company 
at december   btg had outstanding long term borrowings of  under the facility 
we currently maintain our funds in commercial paper  money market funds and other liquid debt instruments 
see note c and d of notes to consolidated financial statements 
btg manages its israeli operations with the objective of protecting against any material net financial loss in us dollars from the impact of israeli inflation and currency devaluations on its non us dollar assets and liabilities 
the cost of btg s operations in israel  as expressed in dollars  is influenced by the extent to which any increase in the rate of inflation in israel is not offset or is offset on a lagging basis by a devaluation of the israeli shekel in relation to the us dollar 
the rate of inflation as measured by the consumer price index in israel was approximately in  while the shekel was devalued by less than 
in there was no change in the consumer price index and the shekel s value in relation to the us dollar increased by approximately 
in the inflation rate was approximately while the shekel was devalued by 
as a result  for those expenses linked to the israeli shekel  such as salaries and rent  this resulted in corresponding increases in these costs in us dollar terms in and however  in  for those expenses this resulted in corresponding decreases in these costs in us dollar terms 
to the extent that expenses in shekels exceed btg s revenues in shekels which to date have consisted primarily of research funding from the chief scientist and product sales in israel  the devaluations of israeli currency have been and will continue to be a benefit to btg s financial condition 
however  should btg s revenues in shekels exceed its expenses in shekels in any material respect  the devaluation of the shekel will adversely affect btg s financial condition 
further  to the extent the devaluation of the shekel with respect to the us dollar does not substantially offset the increase in the costs of local goods and services in israel  btg s financial results will be adversely affected as local expenses measured in us dollars will increase 
we believe that our cash resources as of december   together with anticipated product sales and continued funding from the chief scientist at current levels will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations for the foreseeable future 
there can  however  be no assurance that product sales will occur as anticipated  that current agreements with third party distributors of our products will not be canceled  that the chief scientist will continue to provide funding at current levels  that we will not use a substantial portion of our cash resources to acquire businesses  products and or technologies  or that unanticipated events requiring the expenditure of funds will not occur 
the satisfaction of btg s future cash requirements will depend in large part on the status of commercialization of btg s products  btg s ability to enter into additional research and development and licensing arrangements  and btg s ability to obtain additional equity and debt financing  if necessary 
there can be no assurance that btg will be able to obtain additional funds or  if such funds are available  that such funding will be on favorable terms 
btg continues to seek additional collaborative research and development and licensing arrangements  in order to provide revenue from sales of certain products and funding for a portion of the research and development expenses relating to the products covered  although there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such agreements 
see item business risk factors we may be unable to obtain any additional capital needed to operate and grow our business and we expect our quarterly results to fluctuate  which may cause volatility in our stock price
