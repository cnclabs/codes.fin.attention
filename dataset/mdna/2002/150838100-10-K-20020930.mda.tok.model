item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview celadon group  inc  through its operating subsidiaries  provides truckload transportation services in and between the nafta countries of the united states  mexico and canada 
we deliver our services through a network of owned and leased tractors and  to a lesser extent  independent owner operators 
we excel in service  safety and technology as we move time sensitive freight in and between the united states  canada and mexico 
consistent with our focus on technology to improve our core businesses  we also operate truckersbb  inc  a profitable e procurement business that passes on volume purchasing power to more than  member fleets to provide discounts on fuel  tire and other related services 
we continually evaluate our acquisition opportunities in order to expand our core business and improve the quality of our customer service 
we believe that current economic conditions will lead to additional consolidation in the industry  and we feel that we are well positioned to take advantage of that consolidation 
consistent with our strategy  we have made several strategic acquisitions in recent years  including the acquisition of zipp express in and the acquisition of certain assets of burlington motor carriers in  each as described in more detail below 
we believe these acquisitions have significantly improved our lane density  customer base  service offerings and operating results 
recent acquisitions and divestitures we purchased  in march  certain fixed assets of burlington motor carriers  consisting primarily of approximately tractors and trailers  and we incurred million in notes payable related to the transaction 
in june  we sold certain assets and the owner operator and agent contracts of cheetah transportation  inc to american trans freight 
cheetah  a flatbed truckload carrier operating out of mooresville  north carolina  was divested due to its lack of strategic fit with our focus on van truckload operations 
we recognized a million loss on disposition  which included a non cash charge of million  related to the net book value of goodwill and other intangibles 
cheetah had approximately owner operators and revenues of million in fiscal effective july   we acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of zipp express  inc for approximately million 
zipp operated a relatively new fleet of approximately tractors and trailers 
the addition of this newer equipment allowed us to dispose of older  less fuel efficient tractors and other assets 
the effect of upgrading our fleet through this equipment disposition resulted in a non cash charge of approximately million in fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of revenue and expense items to operating revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended june  operating revenue operating expenses salaries  wages and employee benefits fuel operating costs and supplies insurance and claims depreciation and amortization rent and purchased transportation general  administrative  and selling expenses non cash member and vendor development costs cost of goods sold other operating expenses total operating expenses operating income other income expense interest expense  net other income expense  net minority interest in subsidiary loss loss on disposition of flatbed division loss on disposition of equipment income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss fiscal year ended june  compared with fiscal year ended june  revenue 
consolidated revenue decreased by million  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal revenue for fiscal included revenue from cheetah  our flatbed carrier operation  and higher pass through revenues related to the mexican portion of transportation 
in april of  daimler chrysler began to coordinate and contract with mexican transportation companies for the mexico portion of loads 
this decreased our pass through revenues in fiscal by approximately million 
adjusted for these items  last year s consolidated revenue would have been million 
on a comparable basis  excluding cheetah and the pass through revenues in the prior year  revenue for fiscal represented an increase of million  or approximately 
we experienced an increase of approximately million dispatch miles for fiscal related to a strengthening economy and a focused effort to add customers of bankrupt burlington motor carriers 
revenue for truckersbb was approximately million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the truckersbb revenue increase is primarily related to an increase in member usage of the tire discount program 
operating income 
consolidated operating income increased by million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in operating income was primarily a result of decreased fuel  rent and purchased transportation and depreciation and amortization expense offset by increased salaries  wages and employee benefits and insurance expense 
truckersbb operating income increased by million  to million in fiscal from a loss of million in fiscal our operating ratio  which expresses operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue  improved from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in operating ratio for fiscal will also adversely affect the operating expense percentages of revenues discussed further below when compared to fiscal salaries  wages and benefits were million  or of operating revenues  for fiscal compared to for the same period in this increase is primarily related to driver pay for small  focused regional operations which have accretive revenues 
fuel expenses decreased to of revenue for fiscal compared to in fiscal fuel prices have declined approximately per gallon for fiscal compared to fiscal insurance and claims expense was in fiscal compared to for fiscal insurance consists of premiums for liability  physical damage and cargo damage insurance 
our insurance program involves self insurance at various risk retention levels 
claims in excess of these risk levels are covered by insurance in amounts we consider to be adequate 
we accrue for the uninsured portion of claims based on known claims and historical experience 
liability insurance premiums  which were renewed effective may   increased significantly year over year due to continued difficulty in the insurance and reinsurance markets 
rent and purchased transportation decreased million to of revenue for fiscal from for the same period in the decrease in fiscal is primarily related to reduced owner operator expense caused by the sale of cheetah  partially offset by increased usage of owner operators in other areas 
also  as pass through revenue related to the mexican portion of loads decreased  the pass through purchased transportation expense has also decreased 
to offset these decreases  trailer costs have risen as we continue to replace foot trailers with foot trailers 
in addition  tractor costs have increased as most new tractors have operating leases on a four year trade cycle 
net interest expense 
net interest expense decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was the result primarily of lower interest rates as bank borrowings and capital lease obligations were slightly higher at june   compared to june  the bank line borrowings have decreased million to million on june  income taxes 
income taxes resulted in expense of million in fiscal  with an effective tax rate of  compared to a benefit of million  with an effective tax rate of  in fiscal the effective tax rate increased by approximately for non deductible expenses as a result of the increased pre tax income in fiscal compared to the pre tax loss in fiscal fiscal year ended june  compared with fiscal year ended june  revenue 
consolidated revenue increased by million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal beginning in the fourth quarter  daimlerchrysler began to coordinate the mexican portion of transportation causing a decline of million compared to prior year fourth quarter 
in addition  we experienced a reduction in dispatch miles directly related to the softening economy 
the billings related to the mexican portion of transportation decreased for the year approximately million 
truckersbb revenue increased to million in fiscal compared with thousand in fiscal operating income 
consolidated operating income decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our operating ratio increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in operating income and the increased operating ratio were attributable to a significant increase in fuel costs  net of fuel surcharges  of approximately million  or tax effected per diluted common share 
we recovered a portion of the increased cost from customers via the use of fuel surcharges 
however  a portion of the fuel expense increase was not recovered during fiscal year in fiscal  we met with our customers to explain the impact of high fuel prices and to improve the amount and percentage of fuel surcharge reimbursement 
rent and purchased transportation expense increased as a result of owner operator capacity growth in the van truckload division  and higher equipment costs  partially offset by a decreased use of independent mexican carriers 
in addition  depreciation expense and insurance costs increased slightly as a percentage of revenue 
truckersbb had a million operating loss for fiscal year compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal in fiscal  the operating loss included approximately thousand of deferred initial public offering expenses and approximately thousand of non cash member and vendor development expense related to issuing shares of truckersbb common stock at fair value to a strategic partner 
the remaining loss in fiscal was related to expenses incurred in salaries  advertising and other administrative costs 
the loss in fiscal included a non cash charge of million related to the fair value of shares of truckersbb common stock earned by its strategic partners 
truckersbb also incurred million of pre tax operating losses for salaries  advertising  and other costs associated with the start up of this business 
loss of disposition of flatbed division 
in june  we sold cheetah for cash 
we recognized a loss of million  which included a non cash charge of million related to the net book value of goodwill and other intangibles 
net interest expense 
net interest expense increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was the result of higher rates for our existing variable rate credit facility  partially offset by reduced borrowings under capital leases 
income taxes 
income taxes resulted in a benefit of million in fiscal  with an effective tax rate of  compared to a benefit of million  with an effective tax rate of  in fiscal this change in income taxes is a result of our pre tax loss in fiscal compared to the pre tax loss in fiscal liquidity and capital resources we generated cash flow of million  million and million from operating activities in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  the slight increase in cash flow relative to fiscal was due to net income in fiscal  decreases in prepaid expenses and increases in accrued expenses partially offset by increases in other assets and trade receivables 
investing activities provided cash of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
this cash was provided by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment offset in part by the purchase of new property and equipment 
in fiscal  we used million for investing activities  primarily related to the purchase of zipp express 
we used million and million for financing activities in fiscal and  respectively 
these uses were primarily for net bank borrowings  capital lease obligations and stock repurchases 
in fiscal  financing activities generated cash of million 
the proceeds from bank borrowings during fiscal were million  which included funds to purchase zipp express offset by net payments for bank borrowings  other debt and capital lease payments 
our primary capital requirements over the last three years have been funding the acquisition of equipment  the start up of truckersbb and the zipp express acquisition 
capital expenditures including the value of equipment procured under capital leases totaled million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we purchased million  million  and million of revenue equipment under capitalized leases and other financing in fiscal  and  respectively

as of june   the company had a million banking facility credit agreement with ing us capital  llc ing 
the arrangement includes a million revolving loan and a million term loan 
in june  our credit agreement with ing was amended to adjust our minimum ebitda and limitation on leasing covenants and to waive or override certain provisions of the credit agreement to permit us to complete the purchase of the burlington motor carrier s assets and to the sale of certain assets to other parties 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants at june  on september   we entered into a loan and security agreement loan agreement with fleet capital corporation  fleet capital canada corporation and several other lenders named in the loan agreement 
the loan agreement provides to us  our canadian subsidiary and certain of our united states subsidiaries a credit facility in the aggregate amount of million 
the facility consists of two revolving loan facilities  two term loan subfacilities and a commitment to issue and guaranty letters of credit 
the term loan subfacilities consist of a domestic term loan in the aggregate principal amount of approximately million and a canadian term loan in the aggregate principal amount of approximately thousand 
repayment of the amounts outstanding under the loan agreement is secured by a lien on our assets and the assets of certain of our subsidiaries  including the stock or other equity interests of various subsidiaries 
in addition  certain of our subsidiaries that are not party to the loan agreement have guaranteed the repayment of the amount outstanding under the loan agreement  and have granted a lien on their respective assets to secure such repayment 
the loan agreement replaces in full the credit facility the company entered into with ing us capital  llc  in august as of september   of the amount available for borrowing under the loan agreement  approximately million was utilized as outstanding borrowings under the line of credit and the term loans  and approximately million was utilized for standby letters of credit 
the loan agreement  which is for a term of three years  terminates on september  immediately upon completion of the new loan agreement  all interest rate charges and other loan fees will be reduced from the previous credit agreement charges 
at june   million of our previous credit facility was utilized as outstanding borrowings and million was utilized for standby letters of credit 
the average balance outstanding during fiscal was million and the highest balance outstanding was million

as of june   we had tractors on order for delivery in fiscal a commitment for lease financing on these units has been obtained 
management believes that there are presently adequate sources of secured equipment financing together with our existing credit facilities and cash flow from operations to provide sufficient funds to meet our anticipated working capital requirements 
additional growth in the tractor and trailer fleet beyond our existing orders will require additional sources of financing 
inflation many of our operating expenses  including fuel costs and related fuel taxes  are sensitive to the effects of inflation  which result in higher operating costs 
the effects of inflation on our business during the past three years were most significant in fuel 
we have limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and fuel surcharges 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make assumptions and estimates that can have a material impact on the reported results of operations 
while management applies its judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results could vary from those assumptions  and it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using differing assumptions 
we are self insured for most medical insurance claims  workers compensation claims  and general liability and automotive liability losses 
reported claims and related loss reserves are estimated by third party administrators 
claims incurred but not reported are recorded based on historical experience and industry trends  which are continually monitored  and accruals are adjusted when warranted by changes in facts and circumstances long lived assets are depreciated over estimated useful lives based on our historical experience and prevailing industry practice 
estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed to ensure they remain appropriate 
long lived assets are tested for impairment whenever an event occurs that indicates an impairment may exist 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we experience various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and fuel prices 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from our credit agreement credit agreement as of june  a hypothetical movement in interest rates would have an impact on net income of approximately  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely consider actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change our foreign currency revenues are generally proportionate to our foreign currency expenses  and we do not generally engage in currency hedging transactions 
for purposes of consolidation  however  the operating results earned by our subsidiaries in foreign currencies are converted into united states dollars 
as a result  a decrease in the value of the mexican peso or canadian dollar could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and equity 
shortages of fuel  increases in prices or rationing of petroleum products can have a materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
fuel is subject to economic  political and market factors that are outside of our control 
from time to time we will enter into derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
as of june   we had and of estimated fuel purchases hedged through august and january  respectively 
we have recognized approximately  of expense associated with these derivative contracts for the year ended june  a hypothetical movement in the price of fuel future quantities would have an impact on net income of approximately
