during march  the company announced that it was evaluating strategic alternatives for the capital invested in its wet printed flock upholstery fabrics product line 
management took this action because of the significant decline in sales and profitability of wet printed flocks in recent years  a decline related principally to the strength of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies as well as a shift in consumer preferences to other styles of upholstery fabrics 
in april management approved a plan to exit the wet printed flock upholstery fabric business and has been actively seeking to sell the assets related to this product line 
the exit plan involved closing a printing facility and flocking operation within the culp velvets prints division  a reduction in related selling and administrative expenses  and termination of employees 
the company also recognized certain inventory write downs related to this product line 
the total charge from the exit plan and inventory write down was million  of which approximately million represented non cash items consisting of a million write down of property  plant and equipment to its estimated net realizable value of million and a  write down of inventory

other restructuring actions 
during fiscal and continuing into fiscal  the company undertook a restructuring plan in its upholstery fabric segment intended to lower operating expenses  increase manufacturing utilization  raise productivity and position the company to operate profitably on a lower level of sales 
the plan involved the consolidation of certain fabric manufacturing capacity within the culp decorative fabrics cdf division  closing one of the company s four yarn manufacturing plants within culp yarn  an extensive reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses including the termination of employees and a comprehensive stock keeping unit sku reduction initiative related to finished goods and raw materials in cdf 
additionally  the plan included consolidation of the cdf design operation into the company s design center and the implementation of a common set of raw material components for cdf 
the company also recognized certain inventory write downs related to the closed facilities as part of this initiative 
while the physical relocation and movement of machinery and equipment involved in the restructuring was completed by the end of the second quarter of and the related fixed manufacturing cost savings achieved  the company still has much improvement to make to reach targeted productivity and variance levels in the cdf division 
the total charge from the restructuring  cost reduction and inventory write down initiatives was million  about million of which represented non cash items 
the company recognized million of restructuring and related charges during fiscal  and million in fiscal restructuring and related charges for fiscal were recorded as million in the line item restructuring expense and million in cost of sales 
the costs reflected in cost of sales are principally related to the relocation of manufacturing equipment 
due to the restructuring plan  the company has now realized annualized reductions of at least million in fixed manufacturing costs and sg a expenses 
management believes the company now has a sound footprint of efficient  world class facilities utilizing state of the art equipment that position culp to meet the demands by manufacturers for shorter lead times  reliable delivery schedules and appealing designs 
compared with net sales 
the company s net sales for decreased by million  or  compared with the company s sales of upholstery fabrics decreased to million 
for fiscal year  domestic upholstery fabric sales decreased by  or million  to million 
the decrease related primarily to a decline in sales to the external yarn market million  where the company exited certain businesses  and to a decline in sales to the commercial furniture market million 
the company believes that it is improving its market share in the us residential furniture market because of well received fabric placements in the culp decorative fabrics and culp velvets prints divisions 
international sales of upholstery fabric for fiscal were million  down from million in fiscal compared with fiscal  mattress ticking sales increased 
to million for fiscal sales to us bedding manufacturing increased to million for fiscal the company believes that it is gaining market share in the us bedding market as well 
international ticking sales for fiscal were million  down from million in fiscal gross profit and cost of sales 
for fiscal  gross profit  excluding restructuring and related charges  increased compared with fiscal  and increased as a percentage of net sales to from 
this improvement reflected strong gross profit dollar and margin growth in the culp home fashions  culp velvets prints and culp yarn divisions 
offsetting these gains somewhat was a decrease in gross profit dollars and margin in culp decorative fabrics  which occurred in the first half of fiscal the company is optimistic  however  that gross profit margins in cdf can be improved significantly over the next one to two years 
in order to achieve this margin improvement  management expects the key drivers will be increasing the profitability of the current sales mix  improving manufacturing performance  in terms of productivity and inventory obsolescence  and a modest sales growth 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a

key factors influencing the year to year comparison were the sharp  persistent weakness in consumer spending on home furnishings  especially in promotional price categories  and the strength in the us dollar that had an adverse impact on exports 
culp s international sales declined in  following an industry wide trend 
after a number of years of increasing sales  culp home fashions primarily mattress ticking during recorded a decline in sales of 
the company believes that this decline was less than that experienced for the industry as a whole  which was affected by the slowdown in consumer spending 
gross profit and cost of sales

liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
cash and cash investments as of april  increased to million from million at the end of fiscal this significant increase in cash reflects cash flow from operations of million for fiscal  which exceeded capital expenditures of million  debt repayment of million  and reduction of accounts payable for capital expenditures of million 
financing arrangements 
during february  the company amended its million term loan with its lenders to revise certain financial covenants so that a goodwill impairment charge  under the new statement of financial accounting standards no 
 if any  would not inadvertently cause a loan covenant violation due only to changes in financial accounting standards 
in exchange for these covenant changes  the company agreed to increase the interest rate paid on the term loan by basis points 
therefore  the significant goodwill impairment charge of to million on an after tax basis expected to be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal will not cause any violation of its loan covenants 
the company has reduced funded debt by million or from the end of the last fiscal year 
funded debt equals long term debt plus current maturities 
funded debt was million at april   compared with million at the end of fiscal the company s funded debt to capital ratio was at april   its lowest level since july during fiscal  the company amended its credit facility to include terms that restricted the payment of cash dividends and share repurchases  limited capital expenditures  increased the interest rate on its revolving credit facility and increased the letter of credit fees on its industrial revenue bonds irbs 
this amended credit facility provided for a revolving loan commitment of million  and expires on august  the company had no outstanding borrowings under the facility at the end of fiscal the company was in compliance with all covenants contained in its loan agreements as of april  the company has received a loan commitment from its principal bank lender that provides  among other things  for a two year credit facility starting at million and reducing to million as certain irb repayments are made  release of the collateral securing the facility  lower interest rates based upon a pricing matrix  and improved financial covenants 
in exchange for these provisions  the company would agree  among other things  to repay approximately million of its irb debt by october  and pay a credit facility fee 
the company expects to close this new credit facility during the second quarter of fiscal the company paid off million of irb debt in july and expects to pay another million in september the company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against currency fluctuations with respect to firm commitments and anticipated transactions to purchase certain machinery  equipment and raw materials 
commitments the following table summarizes the company s contractual payment obligations and commitments in thousands thereafter total capital expenditure commitments   accounts payable capital expenditures  operating leases        funded debt      total        note payment obligations by fiscal year ending april capital expenditures 
the company maintains an ongoing program of capital expenditures designed to increase capacity as needed  enhance manufacturing efficiencies through modernization and increase the company s vertical integration 
capital expenditures  primarily for modernization  totaled million for compared with million for the company anticipates capital spending of approximately million in the company s principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash investments  cash flows from operations and funds available under its credit facilities 
the company believes these sources will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to meet its needs for normal working capital and capital spending as permitted under the terms of the company s loan agreements 
inflation the cost of certain of the company s raw materials  principally fibers from petroleum derivatives  and utility energy costs have increased somewhat  but overall operating expenses are remaining generally stable 
factors that reasonably can be expected to influence margins in the future include changes in raw material prices  trends in other operating costs and overall competitive conditions 
seasonality the company s business is slightly seasonal  with increased sales during the second and fourth fiscal quarters 
this seasonality results from one week closings of the company s manufacturing facilities  and the facilities of most of its customers in the united states  during the first and third quarters for the holiday weeks including july th and christmas 
critical accounting policies and recent accounting developments accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
some of these estimates require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain  and as a result actual results could differ from those estimates 
due to the estimation processes involved  management considers the following summarized accounting policies and their application to be critical to understanding the company s business operations  financial condition and results of operations 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all the company s accounts receivable are due primarily from residential furniture manufacturers and bedding manufacturers 
ownership of these manufacturers is increasingly concentrated and in certain cases they have a high degree of leverage and substantial debt load 
as of april   accounts receivable from residential and contract furniture manufacturers totaled approximately million and from bedding manufacturers approximately million 
approximately million of the company s total accounts receivable was due from international customers 
additionally  as of april   the aggregate accounts receivable balance of the company s ten largest customers was million  or of trade accounts receivable 
during fiscal and  there has been significant change in the home furnishings industry  including the bankruptcy of several of the largest home furnishings retail chains 
this in turn has affected the furniture and bedding manufacturers who are the company s primary customers 
as a result  culp has experienced substantially higher credit losses in fiscal bad debt expense for fiscal totaled million compared to  in the year earlier period 
the company continuously performs credit evaluations of its customers  considering numerous inputs including customers financial position  past payment history  cash flows and management capability  historical loss experience  and economic conditions and prospects 
while management believes that adequate allowances for doubtful accounts have been provided in the consolidated financial statements  it is possible that the company could experience additional unexpected credit losses 
inventory valuation the company operates as a make to order and make to stock business 
in addition  the company stocks its most popular fabrics in its regional distribution facilities 
although management closely monitors demand in each product area to decide which patterns and styles to hold in inventory  the gradual  yet constant shifts in consumer preferences expose the company to write downs of inventory 
substantially all inventories are valued at the lower of last in  first out lifo cost or market 
management continually examines inventory to determine if there are indicators that the carrying value exceeds its net realizable value 
experience has shown that the most significant indicator of the need for inventory write downs is the age of the inventory 
as a result  the company provides inventory valuation write downs based upon set percentages for inventory aging categories  generally using  and month categories 
while management believes that adequate write downs for inventory obsolescence have been made in the consolidated financial statements  consumer tastes and preferences will continue to change and the company could experience additional inventory write downs in the future 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized from product sales upon shipment to customers from the company s various distribution centers 
provision is made currently for estimated product returns  claims and allowances 
management considers historical claims and return experience  among other things  when establishing the allowance for returns and allowances 
while management believes that adequate allowance has been established for returns and allowances  it is possible that the company could experience levels higher than provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets management reviews long lived assets  which consists of property  plant and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered 
recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell when the company has committed to a disposal plan 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable include a significant changes in its market price  b a significant change in the extent or manner in which the asset is being used  c adverse change in business climate that could affect the asset value permanently  d current and or historical operating or cash flow losses and a projection that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the asset s use  and e an expectation that it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold 
the company s assessment at april  and april  indicated that net undiscounted future operating cash flows of the company s businesses were sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long lived assets under sfas no 
in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  and also resolves implementation issues related to sfas no 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of this statement for fiscal adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have significant impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
goodwill the company assesses the recoverability of goodwill under sfas no 
by determining whether the amortization of the company s goodwill balance over its remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows of the acquired businesses 
if the company determines that goodwill is impaired  the loss is measured using estimated fair value 
the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill will be impacted if estimated cash flows are not achieved 
factors that may impact estimated cash flows include  among other things  consumer demand  the acceptability of the company s products  ability to offer competitive pricing at acceptable margins and a number of macro economic factors including the strength of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies 
the company s goodwill at april  totaled million and related to the following divisions culp decorative fabrics million  culp yarn million and culp home fashions million 
the company s assessment at april  and april  indicated that undiscounted future operating cash flows of these businesses were sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of goodwill 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective as of the company s fiscal year that started april  sfas no 
represents a substantial change in how goodwill is accounted for 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill no longer be amortized and that goodwill be tested for impairment by comparing the reporting unit s carrying value to fair value as of april  if any impairment is indicated  it must be measured and recorded before the end of fiscal sfas no 
requires that any goodwill impairment loss recognized as a result of initial application be reported as of the first quarter of fiscal as a change in accounting principle  and that the income per share effects of the accounting change be separately disclosed 
in response to this requirement  management engaged a business valuation specialist to assist the company in the determination of the fair market value of culp decorative fabrics because of the significance of the goodwill associated with the division and due to its recent operating performance for fiscal and  which had been significantly below its historical level of profitability 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 the company expects to record a special non cash goodwill impairment charge in the range of million to million on an after tax basis related to the goodwill associated with its culp decorative fabrics division 
goodwill amortization of million was reflected for the fiscal years ending april   april  and april  as of april   goodwill will no longer be amortized 
forward looking information the company s annual report on form k contains statements that may be deemed forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws  including the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements are statements that include projections  expectations or beliefs about future events or results or otherwise are not statements of historical fact 
such statements are often characterized by qualifying words such as expect  believe  estimate  plan  and project and their derivatives 
factors that could influence the matters discussed in such statements include the level of housing starts and sales of existing homes  consumer confidence  trends in disposable income and general economic conditions 
decreases in these economic indicators could have a negative effect on the company s business and prospects 
likewise  increases in interest rates  particularly home mortgage rates  and increases in consumer debt or the general rate of inflation  could affect the company adversely 
because of the significant percentage of the company s sales derived from international shipments  strengthening of the us dollar against other currencies could make the company s products less competitive on the basis of price in markets outside the united states 
additionally  economic and political instability in international areas could affect the demand for the company s products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s market risk sensitive instruments are not entered into for trading purposes 
the company has not experienced any significant changes in market risk since april  the company s exposure to interest rate risk consists of floating rate debt based on the london interbank offered rate plus an adjustable margin under the company s revolving credit agreement and variable rate debt in connection with industrial revenue bonds 
the annual impact on the company s results of operations of a basis point interest rate change on the april  outstanding balance of the variable rate debt would be approximately  the company s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is due primarily to a foreign subsidiary domiciled in canada and firmly committed and anticipated purchases of certain machinery  equipment and raw materials in foreign currencies 
the company s canadian subsidiary uses the united states dollar as its functional currency 
the company generally does not use financial derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with the canadian subsidiary 
however  the company generally enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts as a hedge against its exposure to currency fluctuations on firmly committed and anticipated purchases of certain machinery  equipment and raw materials 
the amount of canadian denominated sales and manufacturing costs are not material to the company s consolidated results of operations  therefore  a change in the exchange rate at april  would not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
additionally  as the company utilizes foreign currency instruments for hedging anticipated and firmly committed transactions  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure
