special considerations the trucking industry is affected by economic risks and uncertainties  some of which are beyond its control 
these include economic recessions and downturns in customers business cycles  increases in fuel prices  the availability of qualified drivers and fluctuations in interest rates 
the trucking industry is highly competitive and includes numerous regional  inter regional and national truckload carriers 
some of these carriers have greater financial resources  equipment and freight capacity than the company 
management believes its strategies of controlled growth and focused marketing will provide freight at sufficient volumes and prices to be profitable 
changes in economic conditions could reduce both the amount of freight available and freight rates  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
fuel is one of the company s largest expenditures 
shortages of fuel or increases in fuel prices could have a materially adverse effect on the operations and profitability of the company 
many of the company s customer contracts contain fuel surcharge provisions to mitigate increases in the cost of fuel the company recognized million of fuel surcharge revenue for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in 
however  there is no assurance that such fuel surcharges can be used to offset future increases in fuel prices 
additionally  at times  fuel purchase contracts are used to mitigate the effects of increases in the prices of fuel 
competition for available qualified drivers in the truckload industry is intense and will likely remain so for the foreseeable future 
the company and many of its competitors experience high rates of turnover and occasionally have difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers in sufficient numbers to operate all available equipment 
management believes the company s current pay structure  benefits  policies and procedures related to drivers are effective in attracting and retaining drivers 
however  there can be no assurance that it will not be affected by a shortage of qualified drivers in the future 
the inability to attract and retain qualified drivers would have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
the trucking industry is extremely capital intensive 
the company depends on operating leases  lines of credit  secured equipment financing and cash flows from operations to finance the expansion and maintenance of its modern and cost efficient revenue equipment and facilities 
at present  the company is more highly leveraged than some of its competitors 
if the company were unable in the future to obtain financing at acceptable levels  it could be forced to limit the growth or replacement of its equipment and facilities 
a significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
the company is self insured for cargo loss  damage  liability personal injury and property damage and workers compensation claims within the company s established retention levels 
the current retention level per occurrence is  for cargo loss and  for workers compensation 
the first retention level for liability is  per claim 
the company also carries the risk for the million to million level of cost per occurrence 
if the number of claims or severity of claims for which the company is self insured increase from historical levels  operating results could be adversely affected 
also  the company maintains insurance with licensed insurance companies above the amounts for which it is self insured 
after several years of aggressive pricing  insurance carriers have raised premiums  which have increased the company s insurance and claims expense 
if these expenses continue to increase and the company is unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates  earnings could be materially and adversely affected 
the company is regulated by the united states department of transportation dot 
the dot has broad powers and generally governs activities such as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations  safety and other matters 
the company may be subjected to new or more comprehensive regulations relating to fuel emissions  driver hours of service  or other items mandated by the dot 
for example  new engine emissions standards will become effective for truck engine manufacturers in october these new engines have not been available for adequate testing and may be more costly and less fuel efficient 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources during were funds provided by operations  borrowings under lines of credit and equipment installment notes  proceeds from sales of used revenue equipment and the use of long term operating leases for revenue equipment acquisitions 
in december  the company entered into approximately million in equipment installment notes  the proceeds of which were used primarily to reduce borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit 
in connection therewith  the company s revolving line of credit with a syndicate of banks was amended 
under the terms of the amended agreement  the facility was reduced from million to million  and the maturity date was extended to july in june  the amended facility will be reduced to million 
at december   the weighted average interest rate on the line of credit was  and million was available for borrowing 
interest on outstanding borrowings is based upon the london interbank offered rate plus 
the facility is collateralized by accounts receivable and substantially all other assets of the company  not otherwise encumbered 
in september  the company entered into a long term loan agreement for million to finance the new colton  california terminal facility 
the term of the loan is years  with amortization based on years  and carries a variable interest rate that is based on the day commercial paper rate  plus a margin 
this rate can be converted to a fixed rate at any time up to september in  the company s primary sources of liquidity are expected to be funds provided by operations  borrowings under lines of credit  proceeds from sale of used revenue equipment and long term operating lease financing for the acquisition of revenue equipment 
cash generated from operations decreased to million in from million in  due in part to a million decline in pretax income 
net cash used in investing activities was million in and million in such amounts were used primarily to acquire net revenue equipment and  in  for the acquisition and construction of the new colton  california terminal facility 
during  the company made a million cash investment to acquire a equity interest in transplace 
in  million was used to acquire additional property and equipment  compared to million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment were million in  compared to million in the increase in proceeds in reflects a greater number of owned revenue equipment dispositions compared to during a significant portion of revenue equipment dispositions were related to leased equipment 
net cash used in financing activities was million in and million in borrowings under the line of credit were reduced by million  primarily with the proceeds of million from equipment installment notes in and million in as authorized by the company s board of directors   shares of the company s class a common stock were repurchased in for million 
management believes that funds provided by operations  borrowings under its lines of credit  equipment installment loans and long term operating lease financing will be sufficient to fund its cash needs and anticipated capital expenditures through the following table represents the company s outstanding contractual obligations at december  excluding letters of credit 
letters of credit of  were outstanding at december  the letters of credit are maintained primarily to support the company s insurance program and are renewed on an annual basis 
payments due by period contractual obligations less than total year years years after years long term debt      capital lease obligations   operating leases revenue equipment      operating leases other      total contractual cash obligations      inflation inflation has not had a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition during the past three years 
however  inflation higher than experienced during the past three years could have an adverse effect on the company s future results 
seasonality in the trucking industry  shipments generally show a seasonal pattern as customers increase shipments prior to and reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season 
additionally  shipments can be adversely impacted by winter weather conditions 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets collectively the standards 
the standards are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
requires companies to recognize acquired identifiable assets separately from goodwill if control over the future economic benefits of the assets results from contractual or other legal rights or the intangible asset is capable of being separated or divided and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged 
the standards require the value of a separately identifiable intangible asset meeting any of the criteria to be measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill not be amortized and that amounts recorded as goodwill be tested for impairment 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill will be reduced if it is found to be impaired 
annual impairment tests will have to be performed at the lowest level of an entity that is a business and that can be distinguished  physically and operationally and for internal reporting purposes  from the other activities  operations and assets of the entity 
the company is required to adopt sfas effective january  based on the current levels of goodwill  the adoption of the standards in fiscal will decrease annual amortization expense by approximately million through the elimination of goodwill amortization 
the adoption of sfas no 
could have an adverse effect on the company s future results of operations if an impairment occurs 
management is currently evaluating the effect of this statement on the company s results of operations and financial position 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of and among other factors  establishes criteria beyond that previously specified in sfas no 
to be determined when a long lived asset is to be considered as held for sale 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective january  and is currently evaluating its impact 
item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the company has interest rate exposure arising from the company s variable rate debt 
at december   the company had million of variable rate debt 
the company has interest rate swap agreements which convert floating rates to fixed rates for a total notional amount of million 
if interest rates on the company s existing variable rate debt  after considering interest rate swaps  were to increase by from their december  rates for the next twelve months  there would be no material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
commodity price risk fuel is one of the company s largest expenditures 
the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production  seasonality and other market factors generally outside the company s control 
many of the company s customer contracts contain fuel surcharge provisions to mitigate increases in the cost of fuel 
however  there is no assurance that such fuel surcharges could be used to offset future increases in fuel prices
