the company provides customary credit terms to its customers and generally does not require collateral 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of its customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based upon historical collection experience and expected collectibility of accounts

the actual bad debts may differ from estimates and the difference could be significant 
the company maintains workers compensation insurance with ace usa ace  an independent insurance company  with a deductible of  per incident

subsequent to december   the company was required to provide an additional million in letters of credit as part of its workers compensation insurance renewal for fiscal under the terms of the insurance policy with ace  the company is required to deposit into an account an amount equal to the amount of actual payments made by ace during the previous month as reimbursement to ace for such deductibles 
if claims payments on any specific claim exceed the deductible amount of  the company is not required to reimburse the fund for those payments over and above the deductible 
some states in which the company operates do not permit private insurance for workers compensation  where this is the case  the company is covered by appropriate state insurance funds 
the company has established reserve amounts based upon information provided by ace as to the status of claims plus development factors for incurred but not yet reported claims and anticipated future changes in underlying case reserves 
on an annual basis  the company s claims history is subjected to an independent actuarial review to determine appropriate development factors  which are used in developing the company s reserve estimates 
as of december   the workers compensation reserve totaled approximately million 
such reserve amounts are only estimates and there can be no assurance that the company s future workers compensation obligations will not exceed the amount of its reserves 
however  management believes that any difference between the amounts recorded for its estimated liability and the costs of settling the actual claims would not be material to the results of operations 
intangible assets less amortization were million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
goodwill and trademarks and tradenames are amortized using the straight line method over years  non competition agreements and other intangible assets generally are being amortized using the straight line method over three to six years 
goodwill and other intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the assets may not be recoverable 
the company determines at each balance sheet date whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicates possible impairment 
the company uses an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the assets are recoverable 
where such estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of goodwill  a potential impairment exists 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets for fiscal see impact of recent accounting pronouncements for further discussion on how this standard will impact the company 
to align staff costs and branch office requirements with existing revenue  the company is streamlining its corporate structure and consolidating or closing branch offices in under performing markets

the company is endeavoring to reduce potential future lease payments by subleasing the abandoned facilities or negotiating discounted buyouts of the lease contracts 
consequently  the company s estimates may change based on its ability to effectively reduce such future lease payments 
of the approximately million the company has incurred in restructuring charges  approximately million has been paid out in the form of severance and benefits  lease payments and refinancing costs on the company s revolving credit facility and note purchase agreements 
at december   the remaining accrued estimated net lease payments and accrued severance payments were approximately million 
since december   the company has reduced its staff by an additional full time equivalent employees 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million to offset the entire balance of the deferred tax asset as of december  the valuation allowance was recorded as a result of the losses incurred by the company and the company s belief that it is more likely than not that the company will be unable to recover the net deferred tax assets 
subsequent to december   certain tax law changes will result in the company obtaining a refund from carrybacks of net operating losses 
see recent developments 
accordingly  the company will reduce the valuation allowance during the first quarter of fiscal as a result of these tax law changes

service revenues decreased by approximately million  or  to million for the week period ended december   compared to million for the week period ended december  the decrease was due primarily to reduced demand for temporary services as a result of the broad downturn in the economy 
the company also has seen a significant decrease in permanent placement revenues 
gross profit the company defines gross profit as service revenues less the cost of providing services  which includes wages and permanent placement commissions  employer payroll taxes fica  unemployment and other general payroll taxes  workers compensation costs related to temporary associates and permanent placement counselors  other temporary payroll benefits and other direct costs related to staffing engagements 
gross profit margin for the week period ended december  was  compared to for the week period ended december  the margin decline from the comparable period of the prior year was primarily a result of increased pricing competition for staffing services coupled with a reduction in the higher margin permanent placement business 
the company has renewed its workers compensation insurance for fiscal as part of the renewal  the company is required to pay higher premium costs 
the company believes that some of the increase in costs will be passed through as price increases to its customers 
however  given the competitive nature of the staffing industry  the company is unsure whether it will be successful in passing through all cost increases 
accordingly  the company believes that its gross margin could be negatively impacted in fiscal operating expenses operating expenses include  among other things  staff employee compensation  rent  recruitment and retention of temporary associates  costs associated with opening new offices  depreciation  intangibles amortization and advertising 
total operating expenses as a percentage of service revenues were for both the week period ended december  and the week period ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of service revenues  for the week period ended december  were  compared to for the week period ended december  the increase as a percentage of service revenues is due primarily to the company s revenues declining faster than the corresponding reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses

income from operations income from operations for the week period ended december  was approximately million  a decrease of approximately million  compared to million for the week period ended december  operating margin was  compared to for the comparable period of the prior year 
the decrease in operating margin was due largely to the decrease in gross profit 
income taxes for the week period ended december   the company recognized a tax provision of approximately million 
the income tax provision was caused primarily by recognition of million of deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
the valuation allowance was recorded given the losses incurred and the uncertainties regarding future operating profitability and taxable income 
fiscal compared to fiscal from continuing operations service revenues service revenues increased by million  or  to million for the week period ended december   compared to million for the week period ended january  of the million increase  approximately million was attributable to revenues generated by new offices offset by office closures and million was attributable to increased revenues from existing offices 
gross profit gross profit for the week period ended december  was million  compared to million for the week period ended january   an increase of million  or 
for the week period ended december   gross profit margin was  compared to for the comparable period of the prior year 
the decrease in gross profit margin was due primarily to a reduction in the higher margin permanent placement business 
operating expenses total operating expenses  as a percentage of revenues  increased to for the week period ended december  from for the week period ended january  as discussed below  the increase is due primarily to a loss on impairment of goodwill related to certain intangibles 
during the week period ended december   management determined to eliminate certain specialty lines of business in order to concentrate on core services provided by sos in those markets 
as a result of the change in the company s operational focus in these markets  the projected cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the associated intangible asset

income from operations income from operations decreased approximately million  or  to million for the week period ended december   compared to million for the week period ended january  operating margin was for the fiscal year ended december   compared to for the fiscal year ended january  the decrease in operating margin was primarily due to the increase in operating expenses coupled with decrease in gross profit margin 
income taxes the effective combined federal and state income tax rate on income from continuing operations was for the week period ended december   compared to for the week period ended january  the decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to an increase in income tax credits earned through specific government sponsored hiring incentives 
liquidity and capital resources for the week period ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million for the week period ended december  the change in operating cash flow was primarily a result of a net increase in cash provided from certain working capital components  primarily accounts receivable and income tax receivable

 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for the company s fiscal years ending after december  sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
additionally  under the new rules  an acquired intangible asset should be separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged  unless the intangible assets identified have an indefinite life  those assets will be amortized over their useful life 
assets of the company that have been separately identified include  but are not limited to  trademarks and tradenames  non competition agreements and customer lists 
during fiscal  the company continued to amortize existing goodwill and intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 the company will discontinue amortization of existing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in fiscal the company anticipates that adoption of sfas no 
will result in an impairment of a significant portion of the existing goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life currently carried on the balance sheet  as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will be subject to assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test rather than an undiscounted cash flow approach currently used by the company

the company estimates that it may be required to write off in excess of million of goodwill and intangibles during the first quarter of fiscal however  the company has not completed yet its analysis of the total impact of adopting sfas no 
and this initial estimate may change 
for the week period ended december   amortization related to goodwill was approximately million

the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements beginning after december  but allow for earlier application 
the company currently is assessing the impact the adoption of these provisions will have on the company s financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily in relation to its revolving credit facility and its senior secured notes 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
the company s senior debt placement bears interest at a fixed interest rate 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes generally affect the fair value of the debt  but not the earnings or cash flows of the company 
changes in the fair market value of fixed rate debt generally will not have a significant impact on the company unless the company is required to refinance such debt 
revolving credit facility the company s revolving credit facility bears interest at the prime rate plus  at december   such prime rate was 
for the week period ended december   the company had no advances outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
senior notes for the week period ended december   the company s outstanding borrowings on the senior notes were million  with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 
as stated above  any changes in the fair value of the senior notes generally will not have a significant impact on the company unless the company is required to refinance the senior notes 
the fair value of the company s senior notes is estimated by discounting expected cash flows at the prime rate  at december   plus 
using such discount rate over the expected maturities of the senior notes  the company calculates that the estimated fair value of the obligations on the senior notes  using a discount rate of over the expected maturities of the obligations  is approximately million 
if the discount rate were to increase by to  the estimated fair value of the obligation on the unsecured notes would be approximately million 
if the discount rate were to decrease by to  the estimated fair value of the obligation on the unsecured notes would be approximately million
