for the year ended december   we consolidated the results of operations from upc  our systems in australia until november   chile from may   peru  brazil fortaleza and uruguay 
unconsolidated systems include our interests in certain systems in upc  brazil jundiai  mexico  australia after november   new zealand  the philippines and china and our interests in companies that provide video content to the spanish  australian and latin american markets 
ugc holdings accounts for these unconsolidated systems using the equity method of accounting 
risks  uncertainties and liquidity each of our major operating subsidiaries has net working capital deficiencies as a result of recurring losses from operations and defaults under certain bank credit facilities  senior notes and senior discount note agreements  summarized as follows upc determined that it would not make interest payments on certain of its senior notes as they fell due on february   which constituted an event of default under the indentures related to such notes 
the occurrence of these events of default constituted cross events of default under the indentures related to the remaining series of senior notes  senior discount notes and certain of upc s bank facilities  raising substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern 
vtr does not have sufficient operating cash flow to service its indebtedness over the next year  raising substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern 
vtr s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on a successful refinancing of its million bank facility that is due april  uap failed to make the required interest payment due november  on its senior discount notes and failed to cure this event of default 
uap s working capital and projected operating cash flow are not sufficient to fund its expected expenditures and repay the uap notes over the next year  raising substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern

austar united has a net working capital deficiency and its projected cash flows are insufficient to fund its expected expenditures and pay its liabilities when due over the next year  raising substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern 
based on the above events  there is substantial doubt about ugc holdings ability to continue as a going concern 
for further discussion see liquidity and capital resources included herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements required us to make estimates and judgments that affected the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  which would potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to the ugc holdings consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the provision of video  voice and internet access services to customers in the period the related services are provided 
we recognize initial installation fees related to cable television services as revenue in the period in which the installation occurs  to the extent installation fees are equal to or less than direct selling costs  which are expensed 
to the extent installation fees exceed direct selling costs  the excess fees are deferred and amortized over the average contract period 
for dth  initial installation fees are deferred and amortized over the average contract period 
all installation fees and related costs with respect to reconnections and disconnections are recognized in the period in which the reconnection or disconnection occurs because reconnection fees are charged at a level equal to or less than related reconnection costs 
recoverability of tangible and intangible assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived tangible assets  identifiable intangibles and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we evaluate the future cash flows to determine if we need to take an impairment charge 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we recognize an impairment loss 
the measurement of the impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset  which we generally determine using a discounted cash flow approach and recent comparable transactions in the market 
investments in affiliates  accounted for under the equity method for those investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and companies in which our voting interest is to  our investments are held through a combination of voting common stock  preferred stock  debentures or convertible debt and or we exert significant influence through board representation and management authority  the equity method of accounting is used 
under this method  the investment  originally recorded at cost  is adjusted to recognize our proportionate share of net earnings or losses of the affiliate  limited to the extent of our investment in and advances to the affiliate  including any debt guarantees or other contractual funding commitments 
our proportionate share of net earnings or losses of affiliates includes the amortization of the excess of our cost over our proportionate interest in each affiliate s net assets 
we evaluate our investments in publicly traded securities accounted for under the equity method for impairment in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock apb and staff accounting bulletin no 
accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities sab 
a decline in value of an investment which is other than temporary is recognized as a realized loss  establishing a new carrying value for the investment 
factors considered in making this evaluation include the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including cash flows of the investee and any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain our investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon our assessment of probable loss related to overdue accounts receivable 
upon disconnection of a subscriber  the account is fully reserved 
the allowance is maintained on the books until either receipt of payment or the account is deemed uncollectable for a maximum of three years 
services to date  our primary source of revenue has been video entertainment services to residential customers 
we believe that an increasing percentage of our future revenues will come from telephone  internet access services and digital video services within the residential and business markets 
the introduction of telephone and internet access services had a significant negative impact on adjusted ebitda during and we expected this negative impact due to the high costs associated with obtaining subscribers  branding  and launching these new services against the incumbent operators 
we intend for these new businesses to be adjusted ebitda positive after two to three years following introduction of the services  but there can be no assurance this will occur 
we believe that increasing the number of subscribers to such services will continue to have a negative impact on adjusted ebitda  due to the costs of developing such services in new areas and the one time costs associated with obtaining new customers for these services 
distribution video 
our operating systems generally offer a range of video service subscription packages including a basic tier and an expanded basic tier 
in some systems  we also offer mini tiers and other premium programming 
historically  video services revenue has increased as a result of acquisitions of systems  subscriber growth from both well established and developing systems  and increases in revenue per subscriber from basic rate increases and the introduction of impulse pay per view services which enable subscribers to our expanded basic tier to select and purchase programming services  such as movies and special events  directly by remote control

upc distribution impairment charge 
this charge is primarily related to upc s investment in upc gmbh 
upc has a interest in upc gmbh  which in turn holds a interest in ewt tss 
during  upc pursued merger opportunities with respect to upc gmbh that ultimately did not materialize 
because upc lacks the financial resources to fully develop the triple play in germany  and due to the inability of upc to find a partner to help implement this strategy  the long range plans of upc gmbh were revised to provide for a care and maintenance program  meaning that the business plan will be primarily focused on current customers and product offerings instead of a planned roll out of new service offerings 
as a result of this revised business plan  and in accordance with upc s policy regarding recoverability of tangible and intangible assets  upc determined that a triggering event had occurred with respect to this investment in the fourth quarter of  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
after analyzing the projected undiscounted free cash flows without interest  an impairment charge was deemed necessary 
the amount of the charge was determined by evaluating the estimated fair market value of the investment in ewt tss using a discounted cash flow approach  resulting in an impairment charge of million for the year ended december  priority telecom impairment charge 
during the second quarter of  upc identified indicators of possible impairment of long lived assets  principally irus and related goodwill  within its clec subsidiary priority telecom 
such indicators included significant declines in the market value of publicly traded telecommunications providers and a change  subsequent to the acquisition of cignal  in the way that certain assets from the cignal acquisition were being used within priority telecom 
upc revised its strategic plans for using these assets because of reduced levels of private equity funding activity for clec businesses and a decision by upc to complete a public listing of priority telecom in the second half of the changes in strategic plans included a decision to phase out the legacy international wholesale voice operations of cignal 
when upc and priority telecom reached agreement to acquire cignal in the second quarter of  the companies originally intended to continue the international wholesale voice operations of cignal for the foreseeable future 
this original plan for the international wholesale voice operations was considered in the determination of the consideration paid for cignal 
in  using the strategic plan prepared in connection with the public listing of priority telecom  an impairment assessment test and measurement in accordance with sfas was completed  resulting in a write down of tangible assets  related goodwill and other impairment charges of million for the year ended december  swiss wireless license 
this license was acquired by upc during since its acquisition  upc has been evaluating various alternatives to develop this license 
during the fourth quarter of  in connection with upc s overall strategic review  it was determined that upc was not in a position to develop this asset as a result of both funding constraints and a change in strategic focus away from the wireless business  resulting in a write down of the value of this asset to nil and a charge of million for the year ended december  microsoft contract acquisition rights 
as a result of issuing warrants to microsoft corporation during and  upc recorded million in contract acquisition rights 
these rights were being amortized over the three year term of an interim technology agreement 
during the fourth quarter of  this interim technology agreement was terminated  and the remaining unamortized contract acquisition rights totaling million were written off 
in december  austar united reviewed all of its activities and restructured its business to focus on the core pay television business and augment it with interactive television services 
this restructuring included outsourcing a number of existing functions  ceasing operation of its own internet network  streamlining sales and customer service processes and reducing general corporate overhead

we cannot allocate a portion of upc s net losses to the minority shareholder once the minority shareholders common equity basis has been exhausted 
we will consolidate of the net losses of upc until such time as the preference shareholders convert their holdings into common equity  or until additional common equity is contributed by third party investors 
the decrease in was offset by the allocation of significant net losses from upc germany to the minority shareholder  as a result of the impairment charge of million in december during  the minority interests share of losses increased million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily due to increased net losses by upc and austar united

merger transaction united was formed in february as part of a series of planned transactions with ugc holdings and liberty  which are intended to accomplish a restructuring and recapitalization of our business 
on january   we completed a transaction with liberty and ugc holdings  pursuant to which the following occurred 
immediately prior to the merger transaction on january  liberty contributed approximately million shares of ugc holdings class b common stock and approximately million shares of ugc holdings class a common stock to united 
in exchange for these contributions  we issued liberty approximately million shares of our class c common stock  the founders transferred their shares of ugc holdings class b common stock to limited liability companies  which limited liability companies then merged into united 
as a result of such mergers  the founders received approximately million shares of our class b common stock  which number of shares equals the number of shares of ugc holdings class b common stock transferred by them to the limited liability companies 
as a result of the merger transaction ugc holdings became our owned subsidiary  each share of ugc holdings class a and class b common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger was converted into one share of our class a common stock  the shares of ugc holdings preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger  other than ugc holdings series e preferred stock  were converted into an aggregate of approximately million shares of our class a common stock  which amount is equal to the number of shares of ugc holdings class a common stock the holders of ugc holdings preferred stock would have received had they converted their preferred stock immediately prior to the merger  the shares of ugc holdings series e preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger were converted into an aggregate of  shares of ugc holdings class a common stock  liberty has the right to elect four of our directors  the founders have the effective voting power to elect eight of our directors  and we have the right to elect half of ugc holdings directors and four of the founders  gene w 
schneider  mark l 
schneider  albert m 
carollo  sr 
and curtis w 
rochelle  have the right to elect the other half of ugc holdings directors 
immediately following the merger transaction liberty contributed to us the belmarken notes and  as a result  two of our dutch subsidiaries owe the amounts payable under such notes  which had an accreted value of million as of january   to us rather than to liberty  liberty contributed million in cash to us  liberty contributed to us the liberty upc bonds and  as a result  upc owes the obligations represented by the liberty upc bonds to us rather than to liberty  and in exchange for the contribution of these assets to us  we issued an aggregate of approximately million shares of our class c common stock to liberty 
in december  idt united commenced a cash tender offer for  and related consent solicitation with respect to  the entire billion face amount of senior notes of ugc holdings 
this tender offer expired at pm  new york city time  on february  as of the expiration of the tender offer  holders of the notes had validly tendered and not withdrawn notes representing approximately billion aggregate principal amount at maturity 
at the time of the tender offer  liberty had an equity and debt interest in idt united 
prior to the merger on january   we acquired from liberty million aggregate principal amount at maturity of the senior notes of ugc holdings  as well as all of liberty s interest in idt united 
the purchase price for the senior notes and liberty s interest in idt united was our assumption of approximately million of indebtedness owed by liberty to ugc holdings due january   and cash in the amount of approximately million 
on january   lbtw i  inc  a subsidiary of liberty  loaned united argentina approximately million  of which approximately million was used to purchase shares of preferred stock and promissory notes issued by idt united 
following january   lbtw i  inc loaned united argentina an additional approximately million  as evidenced by promissory notes dated january   february   february   february  and february  we have used the proceeds of these loans to purchase additional shares of preferred stock and promissory notes issued by idt united 
these notes to lbtw i  inc accrue interest at annually  compounded and payable quarterly  and each note matures on its first anniversary 
we have no independent operations of our own other than those attributable to our common stock interest in ugc holdings 
our board of directors and the board of directors of ugc holdings recently approved the conversion of the economic interest held by the founders into ugc holdings class c non voting common stock  which would result in voting control over ugc holdings board of director elections by us 
following conversion  we would consolidate ugc holdings and its subsidiaries 
the timing of that conversion is uncertain  but is expected to occur as soon as practicable 
we plan to account for the merger transaction on january  as a reorganization of entities under common ownership  followed by a preferred stock conversion at historical cost  and then a share issuance to liberty for financial assets at fair value 
accordingly  our investment in ugc holdings and share in results of ugc holdings are expected to be based on historical cost  using the equity method of accounting 
effective with the merger transaction  we anticipate reflecting a negative investment in ugc holdings equal to the deficit in stockholders equity of ugc holdings at the effective time of the merger transaction  reduced by the ugc holdings senior notes acquired directly from liberty and through idt united and by the conversion of series b convertible preferred stock previously reflected in temporary equity 
we plan to continue to record our share of ugc holdings losses because we believe it is probable that we will obtain voting control over ugc holdings board of director elections in the foreseeable future  at which time we would consolidate ugc holdings 
the issuance of our new shares of class c common stock for cash  liberty upc bonds and belmarken notes was recorded at the fair value of our common stock at closing 
the estimated fair value of the liberty upc bonds and the belmarken notes was significantly less than the accreted value of those debt securities as reflected in ugc holdings historical financial statements 
we will recognize interest income on these securities using the effective interest method 
equity method accounting will result in recognition by us of of the interest expense on these securities through our share in the results of ugc holdings 
if we consolidate ugc holdings in the future  we expect to recognize extraordinary gains from the effective retirement of such debt outstanding at that time equal to the excess of the then accreted value of such debt over our amortized cost 
while we are using the equity method of accounting  this gain will effectively be recognized over time through the additional accretion under the effective interest method 
we believe the accounting for the merger transaction and the subsequent application of the equity method of accounting discussed herein and as presented below is appropriate in our circumstances 
this accounting will present our post merger and restructuring financial statements on a basis generally consistent with what would have been reported as stockholders equity deficit and net income loss had we consolidated ugc holdings subsequent to the merger transaction date 
however  it is possible that the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec may not agree with our conclusions regarding the accounting for the merger transaction and the subsequent application of the equity method of accounting because the circumstances are unique and subject to judgment and interpretation 
if the sec were to disagree with our conclusions with respect to the accounting for the merger transaction and our expected application of the equity method of accounting subsequent to the merger transaction date  our future historical financial statements could differ materially from the unaudited pro forma financial information presented herein 
for example  under apb  an investor typically suspends loss recognition at the point in time in which its investment account is reduced to zero and there exists no contractual funding commitments  explicit or implied  and where a return to profitable operations is not anticipated in the foreseeable future 
furthermore  the sec could view the transaction as the effective formation of us by liberty wherein we then acquire the non liberty interests of ugc holdings at fair value and the historical liberty interests of ugc holdings 
if so  the belmarken notes and the liberty upc bonds contributed to us by liberty would be recorded at liberty s historical cost basis 
in this alternative wherein we would be deemed to be the acquiror of ugc holdings  future loss recognition related to our investment in ugc holdings may not be appropriate under apb for the reasons set forth above and because we would establish a new cost basis at fair value with respect to the approximate non liberty interest in ugc holdings acquired by us through the issuance of common shares 
we do not believe this approach is reflective of the form and substance of the merger transaction since there are various agreements between liberty  us and the founders which could preclude liberty from exercising majority control over the election of our directors until june we intend to discuss and resolve this issue with the staff prior to the issuance of any historical financial statements subsequent to the date of the merger transaction which closed on january  the following unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations for the period from january  through december  and the unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of december   provide an analysis of what our operations might have looked like had we and liberty consummated the merger transaction as of january   and what our financial position might have looked like had we consummated the merger transaction as of december  this unaudited pro forma financial information is derived from  and should be read together with  our and ugc holdings historical financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  in addition to certain assumptions and adjustments  which are described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma information 
this unaudited pro forma financial information may not be indicative of the historical results that we would have had or the future results that we will experience after the merger transaction 
the actual financial position and results of operations may differ  perhaps significantly  from the pro forma amounts reflected herein because of a variety of factors  including access to additional information  changes in value not currently identified  changes in operating results between the dates of the pro forma financial information and january  and as a result of the matters discussed in the preceding paragraphs

ugc holdings had million of cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term liquid investments on hand as of december  additional sources of cash in may include the raising of additional private or public debt and or equity and or proceeds from the disposition of non strategic assets 
uses of cash in the next year will include funding to the latin america region to meet the existing growth plans of our systems and a million contingent cash account funded march  as part of the refinancing of the austar united bank facility 
we believe that our existing capital resources will enable us to assist in satisfying the operating and development requirements of our subsidiaries and cover corporate overhead for the next year 
to the extent we pursue new acquisitions or development opportunities  we will need to raise additional capital or seek strategic partners 
because we do not currently generate positive operating cash flow  our ability to repay our long term obligations will be dependent on developing one or more additional sources of cash 
upc 
upc has incurred substantial operating losses and negative cash flows from operations  which have been driven by continuing development efforts  including the introduction of new services such as digital video  telephone and internet 
in addition  substantial capital expenditures have been required to deploy these services and to acquire businesses 
management expects upc to incur operating losses at least through  primarily as a result of the continued introduction of these new services  which are in the early stages of deployment  as well as continued depreciation and amortization expense 
as of december   there was substantial uncertainty whether upc s sources of capital  working capital and projected operating cash flow were sufficient to fund its expenditures and service its indebtedness over the next year 
in addition  as a result of the events of default described below  the majority of upc s indebtedness has been classified as current 
these factors raise substantial doubt about upc s ability to continue as a going concern 
upc s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on i its ability to restructure its senior notes and senior discount notes  its exchangeable loan and its convertible preferred stock and ii its ability to generate enough cash flow to enable it to recover its assets and satisfy its liabilities in the normal course of business 
given upc s funding requirements and possible lack of access to debt and equity capital in the near term  upc determined that it would not make interest payments on its senior notes as they fell due 
on february   upc failed to make required interest payments in the aggregate amount of million on its outstanding senior notes due  senior notes due and senior notes due the indentures related to its senior notes and senior discount notes provide that failing to make interest payments constitutes an event of default under the notes if upc is in default of the payment of interest on any of the notes for a period of time in excess of days 
since upc failed to make the interest payments upon expiration of this day grace period on march   events of default occurred under those indentures 
the occurrence of these events of default resulted in cross events of default under the indentures related to the remaining series of senior notes and senior discount notes 
the occurrence of the various events of default gave the trustees under the related indentures  or requisite number of holders of such notes  the right to accelerate the maturity of all of upc s senior notes and senior discount notes 
as of april   neither the trustees for those notes nor the requisite number of holders of those notes have accelerated the payment of principal and interest under those notes 
on february   upc signed a memorandum of understanding with us and ugc holdings 
the memorandum of understanding describes a non binding agreement in principle with us and ugc holdings to enter into negotiations with the holders of upc s senior notes and senior discount notes to attempt to reach agreement on a means to restructure upc s indebtedness at the holding company level 
as of february   we held approximately billion face amount of upc s senior notes and senior discount notes  in addition to the exchangeable loan 
upc s failure to make the february  interest payment on its outstanding senior notes due  senior notes due and senior notes due gave rise to cross events of default under the following credit and loan facilities senior secured credit facility among upc distribution as borrower  td bank europe limited and toronto dominion texas  inc  as facility agents  and a group of banks and financial institutions the upc distribution bank facility  revolving loan facility among ewt elektro nachrichtentechnik gmbh  upc s majority owned subsidiary ewt  as borrower  a group of entities as guarantors  the royal bank of scotland plc rbs as facility agent and security agent and a group of financial institutions the ewt facility  and exchangeable loan 
the upc distribution bank facility is secured by share pledges on upc distribution which is the holding company of most companies within the upc distribution group 
the ewt facility is secured by share pledges over ewt to rbs 
the occurrence of the cross events of default under such facilities gave the creditors under such facilities the right to accelerate the maturity of the loans and to foreclose upon the collateral securing the loans 
on march   upc received waivers from the lenders under the upc distribution bank facility  the ewt facility and the exchangeable loan for the cross events of default under such facilities that existed or may exist as a result of upc s failure to make the interest payment due on february  on upc s outstanding senior notes due  senior notes due and senior notes due  failure by upc to make the interest payment due on may  on its outstanding senior notes due and senior notes due within the applicable cure periods  or any resulting cross defaults 
each of these waivers will remain effective until the earlier of june   the occurrence of any other event of default under the respective credit or loan facility that is not covered by the waiver  or in the case of the waiver for the exchangeable loan only  the acceleration of any advances under the upc distribution bank facility  the conversion of the notes under the credit or loan facility into upc ordinary shares in accordance with the terms of the memorandum of understanding or five business days after united has given notice to upc that  in its judgment  restructuring negotiations with the holders of the senior notes and senior discount notes are not progressing satisfactorily 
in addition  each of these waivers contains certain other conditions and undertakings and will terminate if there is a default by upc of the terms of that waiver 
the waiver under the upc distribution bank facility subjects upc to a million drawdown limitation under that facility  subject to certain conditions  during the period in which the waiver is in place 
as of april   upc had not made the interest payment on the senior notes due  senior notes due and senior notes due none of the notes or facilities described above have been accelerated or subjected to enforcement actions and none of the defaults described above have had a material adverse effect on the operations of upc s subsidiaries or their or upc s relationships with customers  suppliers and employees 
the occurrence of the events of default described above also triggered the right of the holders of a minority interest in upc s owned subsidiary  upc germany  to acquire from upc  for nominal consideration  shares of upc germany representing of upc germany s outstanding shares 
on march   upc received the holders notice of exercise 
upon settlement of the exercise  upc s interest in upc germany would be reduced to 
during march  upc met with us and a steering committee representing the holders of upc s senior notes and senior discount notes other than us to begin preliminary discussions with respect to a process for  and terms of  a restructuring of such notes and the exchangeable loan 
we and our advisors and the note holders steering committee and its advisors are currently conducting due diligence about upc and upc s current financial condition 
upc has not reached any decisions with either us or the note holders steering committee regarding the terms or timing of a debt restructuring 
upc expects that this process will take a number of months to complete 
if completed  the restructuring would result in substantial dilution of upc s existing shareholders  a loss of some or all of the fair value of upc s outstanding securities  including upc s ordinary shares  preference shares  senior notes and senior discount notes and the exchangeable loan  and could include material changes in the nature of upc s business 
since upc is in preliminary discussions with us and the note holders steering committee  upc cannot predict the terms or the timing of its restructuring 
in addition  upc cannot be assured that it will be able to reach agreement with either us or the note holders on mutually satisfactory terms for the debt restructuring 
if upc is unable to reach agreement on the terms of the debt restructuring or is otherwise unable to successfully complete a restructuring plan for its debt  upc may seek relief under a debt moratorium leading to a suspension of payments  or a bankruptcy proceeding under applicable dutch laws 
if upc seeks relief under either of these proceedings  or any other laws that may be available to upc  holders of upc s outstanding securities  including upc s ordinary shares  preference shares and senior notes and senior discount notes  as well as the exchangeable loan  may lose some or all of the value of their investment in upc s securities 
such proceedings could result in material changes in the nature of upc s business  material adverse changes to upc s financial condition and results of operations or upc s liquidation 
during  upc reviewed its current and long range plan for all segments of its business and hired a strategic consultant to assist it in the process 
upc worked extensively with this consultant to revise its strategic and operating plans  no longer focusing on an aggressive digital roll out  but on increasing sales of products and services that have better gross margins and are currently profitable 
the revised business plan focuses on average revenue per subscriber and margin improvement  increased penetration of new service products within existing upgraded homes  efficient deployment of capital and products with positive net present values 
in and thereafter  upc anticipates that sources of capital available to them will include working capital and operating cash flows  proceeds from the disposal of non core investments and further internal reorganization and alignment of businesses  availability under the upc distribution bank facility and vendor financing 
upc does not anticipate access to the capital markets as a source of funding unless upc is able to restructure its existing indebtedness 
if upc is able to complete its planned debt restructuring satisfactorily and is able to implement a rationalization of its non core investments and improve its operating performance  upc believes that its existing cash balance  working capital  operating cash flow and availability under the upc distribution bank facility will be sufficient to fund operations for the foreseeable future 
during the period in which the waivers are in place in relation to the cross events of default under the upc distribution bank facility  upc has a drawdown limitation of million under this facility 
should the planned debt restructuring and investment rationalization program be unsuccessful  or should operating results fall behind upc s current business plan  upc would not have sufficient funds to meet its expenditure or debt commitments and as such would likely not be able to continue as a going concern 
as of december   upc had negative shareholders equity 
upc believes this does not affect the fundamentals of its business and is a function of the significant capital investment that is typical of the telecommunications industry that results in large depreciation and amortization charges 
upon occurrence of the event  upc reported this deficit to the euronext 
the euronext put upc s shares on the penalty bench until such time when upc returns to positive shareholders equity 
on february   upc was removed from the aex index  which consists of the twenty five most active securities in the netherlands 
this has not resulted in a delisting of upc shares  which are still freely tradeable 
upc believes this trading measure will not have an impact on its business operations  although upc believes it will have a negative effect on its stock price and could adversely affect upc s ability to raise equity in the future 
by letter dated february   euronext confirmed that once a company has been referred to the penalty bench  it is euronext s policy not to lift the measure until such time as the financial restructuring of a company has been completed 
additionally  shareholders equity should meet the minimum level in order to be listed on the euronext  and other euronext requirements according to its rules must be satisfied 
euronext confirmed that the following items would have to be satisfied in order for the penalty bench measure to be lifted a receipt of unconditional commitments for a financial restructuring resulting in upc having adequate shareholders equity in order to safeguard that upc s shareholders equity will not again turn negative in the foreseeable future  b the consequences for the holders of shares now traded on euronext must be known and c the size of the free float must meet minimum requirements 
in accordance with the dutch civil code  upc will address the issue of its negative equity at the next general shareholders meeting 
upc s ordinary shares a are traded in the form of american depositary receipts adrs on the nasdaq national market under the symbol upcoy 
nasdaq has traditionally maintained certain rules regarding bid prices for continued listing on the market 
the minimum bid applicable to upc for continued listing under standard two of the nasdaq national market is 
on february   upc was informed by nasdaq that upc would be delisted on may   if its adrs do not trade for consecutive trading days above during a day cure period  beginning february  by response letter  upc informed nasdaq about its restructuring process and invited nasdaq to engage in a dialogue on the matter 
should upc s adrs continue to trade below the minimum bid requirement throughout the cure period  upc would be subject to having its adrs no longer eligible for trading on the nasdaq national market 
such a development could have an adverse effect on upc s stock price 
ula 
ula had million of cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term liquid investments on hand as of december   held almost exclusively by vtr 
vtr s working capital as of december  and projected operating cash flows were sufficient to fund vtr s operations for the next year  however they were not sufficient to service its indebtedness over the next year  raising substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern 
vtr s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on a successful refinancing of its million bank facility the vtr bank facility  which is due april  though vtr believes the refinancing will be successful  there can be no assurance that it will occur on terms that are satisfactory to vtr or ugc holdings or at all 
any refinancing that occurs on terms that are less favorable than expected could adversely affect vtr s ability or the ability of ugc holdings and subsidiaries to obtain new or alternative financing 
if vtr fails to refinance this facility  its lenders would have certain enforceable rights  including the right to commence involuntary bankruptcy proceedings or any other action available to creditors 
vtr would then need to obtain funding from external sources  restructure its operations or sell assets in order to repay the vtr bank facility and pay its other liabilities when due 
vtr needs approximately million from us for capital expenditures to meet its growth needs through  although there can be no assurance that ugc holdings will fund all or a portion of such amount 
ula s other systems in latin america need approximately million from us through to continue their development 
to the extent ula pursues additional acquisitions or development opportunities  ula will need to raise additional capital or seek strategic partners

on march   voluntary and involuntary petitions were filed under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code with respect to uap 
uap s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the outcome of this bankruptcy proceeding  including the successful restructuring of the uap notes

 business combinations sfas 
sfas requires the use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas requires intangible assets acquired in a business combination to be recognized if they arise from contractual or legal rights or are separable  that is  feasible that they may be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  exchanged or pledged 
as a result  it is likely that more intangible assets will be recognized under sfas than its predecessor  accounting principles board opinion no 
although in some instances previously recognized intangibles will be subsumed into goodwill 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  the adoption of sfas will have on our financial position and results of operations  as well as the impact on future business combinations that are currently being negotiated or contemplated 
in june  the financial accounting standards board authorized the issuance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever indicators of impairment arise 
the goodwill impairment test  which is based on fair value  is to be performed on a reporting unit level 
goodwill will no longer be tested for impairment under sfas additionally  goodwill on equity method investments will no longer be amortized  however  it will continue to be tested for impairment in accordance with apb all recognized intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   although goodwill on business combinations consummated after july  will not be amortized 
while we have not determined what the impact of the application of sfas will be on our financial position and results of operations  it is possible a substantial cumulative effect adjustment may be required 
as of december   net goodwill of approximately billion is included in our consolidated balance sheet

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
sfas supercedes sfas  and establishes an accounting model for impairment or disposal of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
under sfas there is no longer a requirement to allocate goodwill to long lived assets to be tested for impairment 
it also establishes a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach to deal with situations in which there are a range of cash flows that may be generated by the asset being tested for impairment 
sfas also establishes criteria for determining when an asset should be treated as held for sale 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  the adoption of sfas will have on our financial position and results of operations 
matters pertaining to arthur andersen our independent public accountants  arthur andersen  llp arthur andersen informed us that on march   it was indicted by the united states department of justice on federal obstruction of justice charges arising from its investigation of enron corporation 
arthur andersen has indicated that it intends to vigorously contest the indictment 
our audit committee has been carefully monitoring this situation 
as a public company  we are required to file with the sec periodic financial statements audited or reviewed by an independent public accountant 
the sec has said that it will continue accepting financial statements audited by arthur andersen  so long as arthur andersen is able to make certain representations to its clients 
our access to the capital markets and our ability to make timely sec filings could be impaired if the sec ceases accepting financial statements audited by arthur andersen  if arthur andersen becomes unable to make the required representations to us or if for any other reason arthur andersen is unable to perform required audit related services for us 
in such a case  we would promptly seek to engage new independent public accountants or take such other actions as may be necessary to enable us to maintain access to the capital markets and continue to file reports with the sec on a timely basis

the remaining instruments are marked to market each period with the corresponding fair value gain or loss recorded as a part of foreign exchange gain loss and other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
the fair values as calculated by an independent third party consider all rights and obligations of the respective instruments  including the set off provisions described below 
for the year ended december   we recorded a loss of million in connection with the mark to market valuations 
the consolidated balance sheet reflects these instruments as derivative assets or liabilities as appropriate 
certain derivative instruments outlined above include set off provisions that provide for early termination upon the occurrence of certain events  including an event of default 
in an event of default  any amount payable to one party by the other party  will  at the option of the non defaulting party be set off against any matured obligation owed by the non defaulting party to such defaulting party 
if upc is the defaulting party and the counter party to the swap holds bonds of upc  these bonds may be used to settle the obligation of the counter party to upc 
in such an event of settlement  upc would recognize an extraordinary gain upon the delivery of the bonds 
the amount of bonds that must be delivered is based on the principal ie face amount of the bonds held  and not the fair value  which may be substantially less

inflation and foreign investment risk certain of our operating companies operate in countries where the rate of inflation is extremely high relative to that in the united states 
while our affiliated companies attempt to increase their subscription rates to offset increases in operating costs  there is no assurance that they will be able to do so 
therefore  operating costs may rise faster than associated revenue  resulting in a material negative impact on reported earnings 
we are also impacted by inflationary increases in salaries  wages  benefits and other administrative costs  the effects of which to date have not been material 
our foreign operating companies are all directly affected by their respective countries government  economic  fiscal and monetary policies and other political factors 
we believe that our operating companies financial conditions and results of operations have not been materially adversely affected by these factors
