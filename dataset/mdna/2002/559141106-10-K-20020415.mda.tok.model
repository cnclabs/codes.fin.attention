item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company has historically developed its product lines primarily through the acquisition of license rights to nationally recognized brand names for sales of its apparel in the united states 
following a change of control transaction that added a new management team to stage ii in may  the company streamlined its operations to focus on its most popular labels  relinquishing its license rights for various brand name lines and liquidating its canadian and hong kong subsidiaries 
the relinquished lines were replaced with exclusive licenses for the adolfo brand in and the stanley blackerbrand in stage ii also increased emphasis on its own proprietary labels  primarily timber run and  commencing in  the cross colours trademark 
historically  the company sold its licensed brand name apparel at a higher price and with greater gross profit margins than its comparable non branded apparel 
these advantages are partially offset by royalty and advertising costs included in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
the company s revamped lines were intended to retain the advantages of brand name recognition without the high costs associated with its prior licenses 
prior to the change of control transaction  the company had difficulties reducing sg a expenses and maintaining strong gross profit margins in the face of intensified competition in the retail apparel market  which contributed to substantial net losses 
a turnaround strategy implemented by new management to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies contributed to modestly profitable operating results in the last two quarters of before various noncash or nonrecurring items and throughout despite a disciplined adherence to these turnaround initiatives  an increasingly soft retail market and associated order cancellations and inventory writedowns  combined with expenses for the launch of its cross colours campaign  contributed to a net loss of million for business redirection to reverse this trend  stage ii initiated a strategy of contracting its apparel distribution operations and emphasizing trademark licensing in an effort to reduce the costs and inventory risks associated with its historical core business 
a sell off of the company s apparel inventory initiated as part of this strategy was substantially completed by the end of  resulting in a reduction of its factor debt to  by year end 
as part of its planned business redirection  stage ii granted an exclusive license late in to a major us apparel company for domestic distribution of boys sportswear lines under the cross colours label 
stage ii also completed a licensing arrangement in january with a japanese apparel company for sales of men s and ladies apparel under the cross colours brand throughout japan and its territories and possessions 
although its initial licensing initiatives alone were not expected to reverse its financial downturn in the near term  stage ii was faced early in with unanticipated performance defaults by its domestic licensee under the cross colours license agreement 
in february  the company brought an action against the licensee for unpaid royalties aggregating over million under the license agreement 
see legal proceedings 
the absence of the anticipated revenue stream from this license as well as professional fees incurred in prosecuting its lawsuit contributed to the company s net loss of million for  in addition to substantially impairing its financial flexibility for executing its planned business redirection 
although the company accepted a settlement of  from the domestic cross colours licensee in april  substantially all the proceeds are allocable to repayment of loans from rsc to stage ii 
to address these developments  the company s management entered into various discussions for a potential strategic alliance or equity infusion 
those discussions culminated in august with the execution of the aog agreement for the issuance of a controlling equity interest in the company for million 
the company obtained shareholder approval for the aog transactions in december and expects the closing under the aog agreement to be completed in april after the closing of the aog transactions  the company s reconstituted board of directors will have responsibility for continuing the company s business redirection through one or more acquisitions intended to expand existing licensing operations and add compatible business lines 
see business business redirection 
writedown of goodwill since its completion of an apparel business acquisition in  stage ii recognized an impairment charge in against part of the goodwill recorded in the transaction and amortized the remaining goodwill since that time 
as of september   the carrying amount of the remaining goodwill was million  substantially all of which is associated with the proprietary timber run apparel label included in the acquisition 
stage ii periodically reviewed the value of its goodwill for impairment whenever sales of associated apparel lines or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the intangible may not be recoverable 
the resources devoted by stage ii to promote the acquired label have been inadequate to generate significant sales 
in view of its inability to complete an equity infusion or strategic transaction in to provide those resources  the company recognized a noncash impairment charge of million at year end  representing the entire carrying amount of associated goodwill 
this resulted in negative shareholders equity of  at december   which could be expected to impair the company s ability to execute the planned redirection of its business 
results of operations seasonality 
prior to the contraction of its apparel distribution business  stage ii experienced some seasonal business fluctuations due primarily to seasonal buying patterns for its product mix of casual apparel and activewear 
while sales of the company s products are made throughout the year  the largest sales volume has historically occurred in the third quarter 
the change in this pattern during reflects an inventory sell off associated with the company s efforts to implement its planned business redirection

in addition  the factor is responsible for the accounting and collection of all accounts receivable sold to it by stage ii 
the factor receives a commission under the credit facility in an amount less than of the net receivables it purchases 
the agreements covering the credit facility also provide for the issuance of letters of credit to fund the company s foreign manufacturing orders and for short term borrowings at a floating interest rate equal to above the prime rate 
the company s obligations under its credit facility are payable on demand and secured by its inventory and accounts receivable 
the aggregate amount of letters of credit and borrowings available under the credit facility are determined from time to time by the factor based upon the company s financing requirements and financial performance 
the agreements covering the credit facility may be terminated without penalty by the company on may  or the end of any subsequent contract year upon days notice 
during  stage ii implemented its strategy for contracting its apparel distribution operations and emphasizing trademark licensing as a means of reducing the costs and inventory risks associated with its core business 
this had the adverse but anticipated effect of reducing its financial flexibility by imposing constraints under its factoring arrangements  which provide for the factor to establish credit availability based on the company s financing requirements and financial performance 
the company s direct borrowings under its credit facility aggregated million as of december  these obligations were secured by its inventory and accounts receivable 
during  the company substantially completed a sell off of its remaining inventory and applied sales proceeds to reduce its credit facility debt to  at year end 
because the company s planned business redirection involves implementation of branding strategies to exploit its existing trademarks and possible acquisitions of trademarks or other intangible assets that would not support additional factor debt  stage ii does not expect the credit facility to provide a source of future financing for the redirection 
to the extent additional trademark assets are identified for expansion of its licensing program  the company would be required to seek external sources of financing other than its credit facility to fund acquisitions 
as a result of its net losses in three of the last four years and declining shareholders equity  the company s common stock could be subject to delisting on the amex for failure to meet continuing listing requirements 
see market for the company s common stock and related shareholder matters compliance with amex listing requirements 
in that event  in addition to reduced liquidity in the outstanding common stock and related risks to shareholders  the company s ability to finance trademark acquisitions or other opportunities through equity transactions could be substantially impaired 
as of year end  although the company s shareholders had voted to approve the aog transactions  the closing condition for amex approval of the company s listing application for the aog shares had not yet been satisfied 
the company satisfied that condition on april  and expects to complete the aog transactions before the end of april consummation of the aog transactions will add million to shareholders equity and working capital of the company as of the closing date
