since may  we have principally been in the business of marketing and licensing the cherokee brand and related trademarks and other brands we own or represent 
our operating strategy emphasizes domestic and international retail direct and wholesale licensing  whereby we grant wholesalers and retailers the license to use our trademarks on certain categories of merchandise 
in november  we reaffirmed our strategic relationship with target stores  a division of target corp  by entering into the amended target agreement  which grants target stores the exclusive right in the united states to use the cherokee trademarks in certain categories of merchandise 
see item business 
united states retail direct licensing 
under the amended target agreement  target stores will pay a royalty each fiscal year  up to and including the fiscal year ending january   based on a percentage of target stores net sales of cherokee branded merchandise during each fiscal year  which percentage varies according to the volume of sales of merchandise 
in any event  target stores has agreed to pay a minimum guaranteed royalty of million for each of the two fiscal years ending january  and and million for each of the four fiscal years ending january  through under the amended target agreement  in most cases  we or spell c must receive target stores consent to enter into additional licensing agreements in the united states with respect to the cherokee brand during the term of the agreement 
therefore  our current focus with respect to the cherokee brand is to continue to develop that brand in several international markets through retail direct or wholesale licenses with manufacturers or other companies who have market power and economies of scale in the respective markets 
target stores currently has over  stores in the united states and has publicly announced that it expects to open additional stores in the next twelve months 
we expect that these additional stores will result in an increase in the overall sales volume of cherokee branded products sold by target stores  however  there can be no assurance that overall sales volume will increase 
target stores pays royalty revenues to us based on a percentage of its sales of cherokee branded products 
the amended target agreement  however  is structured to provide royalty rate reductions for target stores after it has achieved certain levels of retail sales of cherokee branded products during each fiscal year 
in fiscal target stores reached the maximum royalty rate reduction in the third quarter 
additional stores are expected to cause target stores to reach the maximum royalty rate reduction even earlier in the upcoming year 
this trend is expected to have a positive impact on our licensing revenues in our first quarter ended may  as well as our licensing revenues for our entire fiscal year ended january   but may have a negative impact on our licensing revenues in our third quarter ended november  as part of a recapitalization that occurred in september  we sold to spell c  our wholly owned subsidiary  all of our rights to the cherokee brand and related trademarks in the united states and assigned to spell c all of our rights in the amended target agreement in exchange for the proceeds from the sale of the secured notes 
see item business 
recapitalization  sale of cherokee trademarks to spell c  issuance of secured notes 
spell c issued for an aggregate of million  privately placed zero coupon secured notes  yielding interest per annum and maturing on february  the secured notes amortize quarterly from may  through february   in the amount of million per year the first two years and million per year the third through sixth years 
the secured notes are secured by the amended target agreement and the united states cherokee brand name and trademarks 
the secured notes indenture provides that any royalties generated by the amended target agreement must be deposited directly into a collection account controlled by the trustee under the indenture for distribution to holders of the secured notes 
excess amounts in the collection account may be distributed to spell c only if the excess amounts exceed the aggregate amount of principal due and payable on the next quarterly note payment date 
such excess amounts  if any  will then be distributed by spell c to us 
since the aggregate payments due under the amended target agreement are million and equal the aggregate minimum guaranteed royalty payable under the amended target agreement  which is also million  there is no assurance that there will be any excess amounts to be distributed 
see item risk factors 
target stores commenced the initial sales of cherokee branded merchandise in july royalty revenues from target stores were million during the eight month fiscal period ended january   million during the fiscal year ended january   million during fiscal  million during fiscal and million during fiscal  which accounted for    and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues during such periods 
while all royalties paid under the amended target agreement appear in our consolidated financial statements  since the issuance of the secured notes  most of such royalties have been  and most  if not all of such royalties received until the maturity of the secured notes  will be distributed to the holders of the secured notes 
see item risk factors 
prior to the maturity of the secured notes  royalties from the amended target agreement will be offset by principal payments to the holders of the secured notes in the amount of million per year during the first two years and million per year during the third through sixth years of the term of the indenture 
during fiscal  of the million in royalty revenues received from target stores  million was paid to the holders of the secured notes 
at various times during fiscal  spell c distributed a total of million to us which amount includes royalty revenues received from target stores during both fiscal and fiscal and interest income earned on royalty revenues 
while we believe that royalties payable under the amended target agreement may continue to exceed the minimum guaranteed royalty payable thereunder  we cannot predict this with any accuracy 
the revenues generated from all other licensing agreements during the eight month fiscal period ended january  were million  during the fiscal year ended january  were million  during fiscal were million  during fiscal were million and during fiscal were million  which accounted for    and  respectively  of our revenues during such periods 
in november  we purchased the sideout brand and related trademarks from sideout sport  inc for approximately million and a portion of the future royalties generated by the sideout brand 
under the terms of the sideout agreement  we agreed to pay sideout sport inc  on a quarterly basis  of the first million  of the next million and of the next million  of royalties and license fees received by us through licensing of the sideout trademarks 
upon the earlier of such time as we have paid sideout total contingent payments of million or october   we will have no further obligation to pay sideout sport inc during fiscal  we made additional contingent payments of million under the sideout agreement 
since january  we have paid  in total  million in contingent payments under the sideout agreement 
the sideout brand generated licensing revenues from existing contracts of approximately million during fiscal  which accounted for approximately of our revenues during such period 
see item business sideout agreement 
as an incentive for our licensees to achieve higher retail sales of cherokee or sideout branded products  many of our existing license agreements  including the amended target agreement  are structured to provide royalty rate reductions for the licensees after they achieve certain levels of retail sales of cherokee or sideout branded products during each fiscal year 
as a result  our royalty revenues as a percentage of our licensees retail sales of branded products are highest at the beginning of each fiscal year and decrease throughout each fiscal year as licensees reach certain retail sales thresholds contained in their respective license agreements 
therefore  the amount of royalty revenue received by us in any quarter is dependent not only on retail sales of branded products in such quarter  but also on the cumulative level of retail sales  and the resulting attainment of royalty rate reductions in any preceding quarters in the same fiscal year 
the size of the royalty rate reductions and the level of retail sales at which they are achieved vary in each licensing agreement 
as of november   we and the newstar group  d b a the wilstar group wilstar entered into a second revised and restated management agreement which revised and restated the terms under which wilstar agreed to continue to provide us with the executive management services of our chief executive officer robert margolis 
mr 
margolis is currently the sole stockholder of wilstar 
on january   wilstar assigned the management agreement to mr 
margolis 
as base compensation for services rendered  mr 
margolis will be paid  per fiscal year  subject to annual cost of living increases 
mr 
margolis is also eligible for annual performance bonuses 
the management agreement provides that  for each fiscal year after fiscal  if our ebitda for such fiscal year is no less than million  then mr 
margolis will receive a performance bonus equal to x of our ebitda for such fiscal year in excess of million up to million  plus y of our ebitda for such fiscal year in excess of million 
as a result  for fiscal we accrued a bonus of million for mr 
margolis  and if our ebitda continues to increase  the bonus payable to mr 
margolis under the management agreement will also increase 
in addition to licensing our own brands  we assist other companies in identifying licensees for their brands 
during fiscal  we assisted mossimo inc in locating target stores as a licensee of the mossimo brand and entered into a finder s agreement with mossimo  which provides that we will receive of the royalties paid to mossimo by target stores 
under mossimo s agreement with target stores  target stores is obligated to pay mossimo a royalty based on a percentage of net sales of mossimo branded products  with a minimum guaranteed royalty  beginning in  of approximately million over the initial three year term of the agreement 
mossimo s agreement with target stores is subject to early termination under certain circumstances 
during fiscal  we received revenues from mossimo of million 
additionally  in fiscal  we entered into four other exclusive consulting agreements  one to represent hot kiss in europe  asia and south america  one to represent dic entertainment s liberty kid s for certain categories in the united states  one to represent candie s for certain categories in asia  and one to represent mrs 
fields both domestically and internationally 
other active consulting agreements include one to represent bum in mainland china  hong kong and macao and one to represent rampage in the philippines  mainland china  hong kong  macao  korea  taiwan  singapore  malaysia  indonesia  thailand  vietnam and cambodia 
our consulting agreements with maui and sons inc and pritikin expired during fiscal in  our board changed our fiscal year end to a or week fiscal year ending on the saturday nearest to january in order to better align us with our licensees who generally also operate and plan using such a fiscal year 
prior to this change our fiscal year was a or week fiscal year ending on the saturday nearest may as a result  the fiscal year ended on january  and included weeks  fiscal ended on january  and included weeks  fiscal ended on february  and included weeks and fiscal ended on february  and included weeks 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  deferred taxes  impairment of long lived assets  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
management applies the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition policy 
revenues from royalty and finders agreements are recognized when earned by applying contractual royalty rates to quarterly point of sale data received from our licensees 
our royalty recognition policy provides for recognition of royalties in the quarter earned  although a large portion of such royalty payments are actually received during the month following the end of a quarter 
revenues are not recognized unless collectibility is reasonably assured 

deferred taxes 
deferred taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance management considers estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 

impairment of long lived assets 
management evaluates the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
which generally requires management to assess these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment by estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets 

contingencies and litigation 
management evaluates contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and records accruals when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the liability is reasonably estimable 
management makes these assessments based on the facts and circumstances and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain of our consolidated financial data 
in december  we assigned the amended target agreement to spell c and spell c issued the second notes

during fiscal  royalty revenues from wholesale licensing agreements totaled  compared to million for fiscal the reduction in royalty revenues is related to the termination and or cancellation of licensing agreements and to the inclusion in fiscal of a one time  royalty payment from a terminated licensee 
in fiscal  our revenues included million from mossimo inc compared to  for fiscal our royalty recognition policy provides for recognition of royalties in the quarter earned  although a large portion of such royalty payments are actually received during the month following the end of a quarter

selling  general and administrative expenses including amortization of trademarks for fiscal were million or of revenues compared to million or of revenues for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased due to expenses of approximately  in severance payments   in amortization of our trademarks   in charitable contributions   in marketing expenses and an additional bonus expense of  offset by decreases of  for travel and entertainment expenses 
for fiscal  certain other accruals totaling  were deemed no longer required and were reversed out 
amortization expenses are expected to increase as sideout contingent payments increase and we purchase other trademarks  and management and staff bonus expenses are expected to rise as our ebitda rises 
our interest expense for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the interest expense is attributable to the secured notes 
interest expense is expected to decrease as we continue to make quarterly payments on the secured notes and the outstanding principal of such notes is reduced 
our investment and interest income for fiscal was  compared to  for fiscal although we had more cash available for investment  the decrease in investment and interest income is due mainly to lower interest rates being offered for investments 
for fiscal  we booked for generally accepted accounting principles a tax provision of million or per diluted share  compared to million or per diluted share for fiscal our effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal our net income for fiscal was million or per diluted share compared to a net income of million or per diluted share for fiscal a portion of this increase in our earnings per share is attributable to our repurchase of  shares of our common stock during fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  revenues increased to million from million for fiscal revenues for fiscal were generated from licensing our trademarks and finders fees for placing mossimo with target stores while revenues for fiscal were generated solely from licensing our trademarks

margolis  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million or of revenues for fiscal after excluding such nonrecurring expense from fiscal results  selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased due to expenses of approximately  in salaries for additional marketing staff to intensify our domestic and international efforts to negotiate contracts   in amortization of our trademarks and an additional bonus expense of  our interest expense for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the interest expense is attributable to the secured notes 
interest expense is expected to decrease as we continue to make quarterly payments on the secured notes and the outstanding principal of such notes is reduced 
our investment and interest income for fiscal was  compared to  for fiscal the increase in investment and interest income is due to more cash being available for investment 
we have fully utilized the net operating losses generated subsequent to our reorganization  which were not subject to section limitations 
for fiscal  we utilized  of our limited section b net operating losses for both federal and state 
in fiscal  we utilized million of our federal net operating loss carryovers and  of our limited internal revenue code section net operating loss carryovers for both federal and state 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal our net income for fiscal was million or per diluted share compared to a net income of million or per diluted share for fiscal a portion of this increase in earnings per share is attributable to our repurchase of  shares of our common stock during fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
on february  we had cash and cash equivalents of million  which amount included restricted cash of million held in a collection account by the trustee under the indenture for the secured notes 
on february  we had cash and cash equivalents of million  which amount included restricted cash of million 
the million increase in cash and cash equivalents is primarily attributable to a reduction in the number of shares of our common stock that we repurchased during fiscal during fiscal  cash provided by operations was million  compared to million in fiscal during fiscal  cash used in investing activities was million  all of which was attributable to trademark purchases and registration fees incurred in connection with continued payments under the sideout agreement and registration of the sideout trademarks 
in comparison  during fiscal  cash used in investing activities was million  due to million which was attributable to trademark purchases and registration fees incurred in connection with continued payments under the sideout agreement and registration of the sideout trademarks  partially offset by the repayment of a  note receivable 
during fiscal  cash used in financing activities was million compared to million in fiscal the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to a reduction in the number of shares of our common stock that we repurchased during fiscal during fiscal  pursuant to our board of directors direction to repurchase a portion of our common stock  we used  of cash to repurchase  shares of our common stock  in comparison to fiscal when we used million of our cash to repurchase  shares 
additionally  during fiscal payments were made totaling million on the secured notes in comparison to million during fiscal uses of liquidity 
our cash requirements through the end of fiscal are primarily to fund operations  repay the secured notes  repurchase shares of our common stock and  to a lesser extent for capital expenditures 
we are frequently approached by parties seeking to sell their brands and related trademarks 
should an established marketable brand or equity become available on favorable terms  we would be interested in pursuing such an acquisition and may elect to fund such acquisition  in whole or in part  using our then available cash 
the following table provides information related to our contractual cash obligations under various financial and commercial agreements payments due by period a contractual obligations less than year years years after years total long term debt b    capital lease obligations operating leases c    unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations d e d e d e total contractual cash obligations  f  f  f a for purposes of the above table  yearly periods were calculated to coincide with our fiscal years  meaning  for example  that the period covered by the column captions less than year starts february  and ends february  b represents payments to the holders of the secured notes 
c represents future minimum non cancelable lease payments with respect to the lease of our office facility in van nuys  california 
the lease currently expires on july   however  we have an option to extend the term of the lease for one additional three year period for monthly rental payments of  d under the terms of the sideout agreement  we agreed to pay sideout sport inc  on a quarterly basis  of the first million  of the next million and of the next million of royalties received by us through licensing of the sideout trademarks 
upon the earlier of such time as we have paid sideout total contingency payments of million or october   we will have no further obligations to pay sideout sport inc since january  we have paid  in total  million in contingent payment under the sideout agreement 
because payments to sideout sport inc are based on royalties received  we cannot predict the exact amount of payments we will be obligated to make to sideout sport up to october  e under the terms of the management agreement with mr 
margolis  mr 
margolis will be paid  per fiscal year  subject to annual cost of living increases 
the management agreement also provides that  for each fiscal year after fiscal  if our ebitda for such fiscal year is no less than million  then mr 
margolis will receive a performance bonus equal to x of our ebitda for such fiscal year in excess of million up to million  plus y of our ebitda for such fiscal year in excess of million 
as a result  for fiscal we accrued a bonus of million for mr 
margolis and if our ebitda continues to increase  the bonus payable to mr 
margolis under the management agreement will also increase 
because payments to mr 
margolis are based on a percentage of our ebitda  we cannot predict the exact amount of payments we will be obligated to make to mr 
margolis over the next five years 
additionally  if we terminate the management agreement without cause or mr 
margolis terminates the management agreement after we materially breach any of the terms and conditions thereof or fail to perform any material obligations thereunder  we would be obligated to pay mr 
margolis  within sixty days after the date the termination  a lump sum in cash in excess of million 
see item risk factors 
f stated amount does not include any payments pursuant to either the sideout agreement or the management agreement with mr

on december   spell c issued the secured notes which yield interest per annum and mature on february  see item recapitalization  sale of cherokee trademarks to spell c  issuance of secured notes and item 
risk factors 
the secured notes amortize quarterly from may  through february   in the amount of million per year the first two years and million per year the third through sixth years 
the secured notes are secured by the amended target agreement and the united states cherokee trademarks and brand names 
the aggregate scheduled amortization under the secured notes is million and equals the aggregate minimum guaranteed royalty payable under the amended target agreement  which is also million 
spell c is dependant on revenues from the amended target agreement for most  if not all  of its revenues 
although the amended target agreement provides for a minimum annual royalty payment  if for any reason target stores does not pay the minimum royalties  spell c will be unable to meet  and will default on  its payment obligations under the indenture for the secured notes 
we are not guarantors of the secured notes  however  the united states cherokee trademarks have been pledged as security for the secured notes and the permanent loss of such trademarks as a result of a default would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the secured notes indenture does not contain any financial covenants that require the maintenance of any financial ratios  cash flows  stock price  value of any assets  credit rating  level of earnings or earnings per share 
the secured notes indenture does contain covenants prohibiting spell c from  among other things  transferring any right  title or interest in the amended target agreement or the united states cherokee trademarks  incurring any encumbrances on such agreement or trademarks  or taking any action to impair the liens on such agreement or trademarks in favor of the holders of the secured notes 
as of february   spell c was in compliance with the covenants in the indenture for the secured notes 
as of february  we did not have any amounts outstanding under any credit facilities or lines of credit and we are not the guarantor of the senior notes or any other material third party obligations 
as of february   we do not have any standby letters of credit nor any standby repurchase obligations 
through may  we paid a quarterly dividend 
however  the payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board and will be dependant upon our financial conditions  results of operations  capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our board 
sources of liquidiity 
our primary source of liquidity is expected to be cash flow generated from operations  and cash and cash equivalents currently on hand 
we believe our cash flow from operations together with our cash and cash equivalents currently on hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and other commitments though the end of fiscal  provided that  if the management agreement was terminated as discussed above  we would not have sufficient cash to make the lump sum payment to mr 
margolis 
see item risk factors we cannot predict our revenues and cash flow generated from operations 
some of the factors that could cause our revenues and cash flows to be materially lower are described under the caption titled risk factors in item of this form k and under the caption title cautionary note regarding forward looking statements at the beginning of this item if our revenues and cash flows during fiscal are only slightly lower than fiscal  we may not have cash available to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock or to explore or consummate the acquisition of other brands 
if our revenues and cash flows during fiscal are materially lower than fiscal  we may need to take steps to reduce expenditures by scaling back operations and reducing staff related to these activities 
however  any reduction of revenues would be partially offset by reductions in the amounts we would be required to pay under the management agreement  employee bonuses and possibly the sideout agreement 
further  the aggregate scheduled amortization under the secured notes does not exceed the aggregate minimum guaranteed royalty payments under the amended target agreement 
until the outstanding amount under the secured notes is fully paid  our ability to obtain funds from conventional sources of long term external financing  such as debt  convertible debt or equity financings is somewhat limited 
we do believe that  if necessary  even prior to the full repayment of the secured notes  we would have access to short term external financing  but we cannot provide any assurance that financing would be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
inflation and changing prices inflation  traditionally  has not had a significant effect on our operations 
since most of our future revenues are based upon a percentage of sales of the licensed products by our licensees  we do not anticipate that inflation will have a material impact on future operations 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures of market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest from time to time we invest our excess cash in interest bearing temporary investments of high quality issuers 
due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity  these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet and do not represent a material interest rate risk to us 
our only long term debt obligations are the secured notes  which are zero coupon secured notes yielding interest of interest per annum 
this long term debt obligation does not represent a material interest rate risk to us 
foreign currency we conduct business in various parts of the world 
we are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates to the extent that the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuates in countries where our licensees do business 
revenues from international licensing comprise of our consolidated revenues 
for fiscal  a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies of countries where we operate was not material
