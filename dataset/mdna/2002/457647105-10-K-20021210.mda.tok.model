item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
critical accounting policies we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we used in applying the critical accounting policies 
within the context of these critical accounting policies  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely event that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventory inventories  which are composed of raw materials  work in process and finished goods  are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined by the first in  first out method 
on a periodic basis  the company analyzes the level of inventory on hand  its cost in relation to market value and estimated customer requirements to determine whether write downs for excess or obsolete inventory are required 
actual customer requirements in any future periods are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from estimates 
if actual or expected requirements were significantly greater or lower than the established reserves  a reduction or increase to the obsolescence allowance would be recorded in the period in which such a determination was made 
goodwill the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and intangible assets and as a result discontinued the amortization of goodwill and any other intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives 
the company has determined goodwill relates to one reporting unit for purposes of impairment testing 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or whenever an impairment indicator arises 
if events or circumstances change  including reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by operations  goodwill could become impaired and result in a charge to earnings 
deferred taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the liability method 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is set up where the realization of any deferred taxes become less likely than not to occur 
the valuation allowance is analyzed periodically by the company and may result in income tax expense different than statutory rates 
earnings summary the company reported a net loss of  or basic and diluted net loss per share for the fiscal year ended september  this compares to a net loss of  or basic and diluted net loss per share in fiscal and a net loss of  or basic and diluted net loss per share in fiscal results improved as compared to fiscal primarily due to lower restructuring charges and a lower fixed cost basis resulting from cost reduction measures taken by the company in fiscal impacting manufacturing  selling  general and administrative and engineering costs 
fiscal results were negatively impacted by the reduction in revenue primarily caused by lower worldwide information technology infrastructure spending 
fiscal results decreased as compared to fiscal primarily due to charges to restructure the company s manufacturing operations by closing the company s manufacturing facility in chandler  arizona and moving those operations to minnesota and thailand 
in addition  a portion of the decrease was due to lower revenue generated by standard flexible circuit product lines associated with the adflex solutions acquisition in late the company took a number of steps during fiscal to reduce its fixed costs including closing the high cost chandler facility and reducing the world wide work force 
although the costs of making these changes were reflected in fiscal  many of the benefits were not realized until fiscal results of operations net sales 
the company s net sales of  for fiscal decreased from fiscal net sales of  the largest portion of the decline was due to a reduction in flexible circuit revenue for high end tape library  tape backup and array applications as a result of lower worldwide information technology infrastructure spending 
in addition  fiscal did not include any bridge flex revenue as the product was phased out in early fiscal the bridge flex was a transitional product that completed the connection from the suspension to the actuator flex for disk drive head interconnect solutions that terminated at the back of the suspension 
the need for bridge flex products was eliminated as the conductors from subsequent versions of these disk drive head interconnect solutions extended beyond the suspension 
in fiscal  the company also experienced a continued decline in flexible circuit revenue from hand held telecommunications applications as the telecommunications market continues to be depressed 
revenue increases in fiscal were experienced in a number of areas including disk drive actuator flex  dvd  integrated circuit packaging and solid ink printer applications to offset a portion of the decreases 
revenue from disk drive actuator flex products increased as the result of market share gains 
dvd related revenue increased due to a customer s new product introduction 
integrated circuit packaging revenue improved as a result of increased demand for stacked memory for high end server applications 
net sales of  for fiscal decreased from fiscal net sales of  the decrease in from was due to lower revenue generated by standard flexible circuit product lines associated with the adflex solutions acquisition in late revenue generated by the acquired adflex solutions operation declined in early fiscal and throughout fiscal as a result of quality  cost and customer service issues existing at the time of purchase 
in addition  revenue from the acquired consumer and telecommunication product lines was significantly impacted by the current economic downturn during the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal revenue from the disk drive industry generated of fiscal revenue as compared to in fiscal this portion should remain similar in fiscal as fsa and actuator flex revenue is expected to increase in proportion to overall revenue 
consumer related revenue was of revenue in fiscal as compared to in due to the dvd and solid ink printer revenue increases 
revenue generated from network system applications was in fiscal down from in fiscal due to the drop in tape storage related revenue 
revenue from other applications was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the september acquisition of adflex reduced the company s dependence on the disk drive industry significantly from its historical levels of of revenue 
fiscal revenue is expected to increase over levels 
the company anticipates that disk drive related revenue will increase as a result of market share improvements for its fsa  flex gimbal suspension assembly fgsa and actuator flex product lines 
revenue increases are also expected as a result of the company s qualification as a supplier of flexible circuits for liquid crystal display applications 
export sales accounted for of the company s revenue in fiscal as compared to for and for  reflecting the high level of interconnect shipments to electronic manufacturers in asia 
a significant portion of the remaining domestic sales are subsequently shipped internationally by the company s customers 
gross margin 
the company s gross margin as a percent of sales for fiscal increased to  from the reported for fiscal the improved gross margin percent was primarily due to a lower fixed cost basis resulting from cost reduction measures taken by the company in fiscal this cost reduction was partially offset by lower fixed cost leverage caused by the reduction in revenue 
the cost reduction measures included the transfer of manufacturing operations from arizona to the minnesota and thailand facilities and a reduction of the company s workforce 
the benefit of the lower cost base was also partially offset by an increase in variable material costs caused by an increased proportion of fsa products in the product mix 
fsa products have a higher variable material cost component than products including only flexible circuits due to the cost of the purchased suspension to which the flexible circuit is attached 
the company s gross margin as a percent of sales for fiscal decreased to  from the reported for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to reduced fixed cost leverage resulting from lower revenue levels of the standard flexible circuits and duplicate costs related to the transfer of manufacturing operations from chandler  arizona to the company s minnesota facility 
the lower gross margin percent was also impacted by the increased proportion of high material content fsa products in the product mix 
gross margins in fiscal are expected to improve due to improved fixed cost leverage resulting from the expected increase in revenue 
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of net sales in as compared to in and in selling  general and administrative spending was million in  million in and million in fiscal expenses were lower than expenses as a result of the restructuring that closed the company s arizona facility and reduced the company s workforce

in addition  the increase as a percent of revenue was due to lower revenues in as a result of the current economic slowdown 
fiscal operating expenses should not change significantly from levels and should decrease as a percent of sales as a result of the expected increase in fiscal revenue 
engineering expense decreased to of net sales in fiscal from in and in engineering spending was million in  million in and million in fiscal expenses were lower than expenses as a result of the restructuring that closed the company s arizona facility and reduced the company s workforce 
the decrease in engineering expenses as a percent of sales for fiscal as compared to is a result of reduced spending due to the completion of the effort to develop a materials manufacturing process 
fiscal engineering spending was focused on manufacturing process improvements  further fsa and fgsa technology improvements  qualifying products and processes for new applications including liquid crystal displays  printers and semiconductor packaging substrates and other high end flexible circuit technology development related to new products 
the fiscal and spending was concentrated on fsa development and the development of a process to manufacture material for use in producing double sided  plated through hole flexible circuits 
fiscal engineering spending is expected to continue to concentrate on manufacturing process improvements  further fsa and fgsa technology improvements  qualifying products and processes for new applications including liquid crystal displays  printers and semiconductor packaging substrates and other high end flexible circuit technology development related to new products

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
while the company transacts business predominately in us dollars a portion of its sales and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
changes in the relation of foreign currencies to the us dollar will affect the company s cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange gains or losses 
to reduce the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations  the company enters into short term forward foreign currency exchange contracts in the regular course of business to manage its risk exposure  not as speculative instruments 
typically  these contracts have maturities of months or less 
the forward exchange contracts generally require the company to exchange thailand baht for us dollars or u 
s dollars for thailand baht at maturity  at rates agreed to at inception of the contracts 
these contracts are not designated as hedges  therefore  the gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are included in income 
the company periodically reviews the outlook for expected currency exchange rate movements as well as the policy on desired future foreign currency cash flow positions long  short  balanced for those currencies in which the company has significant activity 
expected future cash flow positions and strategies are continuously monitored 
at september   the company had one open forward exchange contract to buy a total of  thai baht 
no assurance can be given that the company s strategies will prevent future currency fluctuations from adversely affecting the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows
