funds from operations management believes that funds from operations ffo should be considered in conjunction with net income  as presented in the statements of operations included elsewhere herein  to facilitate a clearer understanding of the operating results of the company 
the white paper on funds from operations ffo approved by the board of governors of nareit in october defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flow from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors with an indication of the ability of the company to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs 
the company computes ffo in accordance with the current standards established by nareit which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions

the adoption of these statements will have no impact on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
in august  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas which is effective january  sfas requires the recording of the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
the company does not expect this pronouncement to have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this standard harmonizes the accounting for impaired assets and resolves some of the implementation issues as originally described in sfas the new standard becomes effective for the company for the year ending december  the company does not expect this pronouncement to have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
bad debt the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its tenants to make required rent payments 
if the financial condition of the company s tenants were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
foreign exchange exposure from time to time  the company may enter into hedging contracts to protect against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
receivables from chelsea japan are recorded in the accompanying financial statements at the exchange rate on the date of valuation 
significant changes in the exchange rate may result in changes to the receivable realized 
valuation of investments the company reviews its investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment wherever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the company recorded a million loss in for an impairment writedown of its investment in an outlet center in guam 
economic conditions substantially all leases contain provisions  including escalations of base rents and percentage rentals calculated on gross sales  to mitigate the impact of inflation 
inflationary increases in common area maintenance and real estate tax expenses are substantially all reimbursed by tenants 
virtually all tenants have met their lease obligations and the company continues to attract and retain quality tenants 
the company intends to reduce operating and leasing risks by continually improving its tenant mix  rental rates and lease terms  and by pursuing contracts with creditworthy upscale and national brand name tenants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from its floating rate debt arrangements 
in december  the company implemented a policy to protect against interest rate and foreign exchange risk 
the company s primary strategy is to protect against this risk by using derivative transactions as appropriate to minimize the variability that floating rate interest and foreign currency fluctuations could have on cash flow 
in december a wholly owned subsidiary of the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective january  with a financial institution for a notional amount of million amortizing to million to hedge against unfavorable fluctuations in the libor rates of its secured mortgage loan facility 
the hedge has a fixed rate plus the spread results in a fixed interest rate of until january  at december  a hypothetical basis point adverse move increase in us treasury and libor rates applied to unhedged debt would adversely affect the company s annual interest cost by approximately million annually 
following is a summary of the company s debt obligations at december  in thousands expected maturity date thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt  average interest rate variable rate debt   average interest rate
