overview we provide specialized contract pharmacy services for the treatment of patients with costly  chronic diseases 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of drugs to patients 

table of contents the following table presents the percentage of our total revenue generated from sales and services provided with respect to the diseases that we primarily serviced in the years ended june multiple sclerosis hemophilia and autoimmune disorders gaucher disease respiratory syncytial virus growth hormone related disorders pulmonary arterial hypertension as a result of the additional revenue that we receive from the acquisition of the sps business  these percentages will change 
we expect the products we sell that are manufactured by biogen and genzyme to constitute a smaller percentage of our total revenue and the products that we sell for pulmonary arterial hypertension to constitute a higher percentage of our total revenue 
sales and services with respect to multiple sclerosis  gaucher disease  respiratory syncytial virus  pulmonary arterial hypertension and growth hormone related disorders are dependent upon our preferred relationships with biogen  genzyme  medimmune  glaxosmithkline  actelion pharmaceuticals us  united therapeutics and genentech 
our agreements with these manufacturers describe the services to be provided by us  including contract pharmacy  information  clinical  reimbursement and customized delivery services 
these agreements generally allow the manufacturer to distribute directly or through other parties  and are short term and may be cancelled by either party  without cause  upon between and days prior notice 
these agreements vary in level of exclusivity and scope of services provided 
we typically purchase products at prices at or below the manufacturers average wholesale sales prices  and our resulting contribution margins vary for each product line 
pricing is customized to reflect specific services to be provided by us and is subject to periodic adjustments to reflect changing market conditions 
a few of these agreements limit our ability to supply competing drugs during and in some cases up to five years after the term of the agreement 
we purchase drugs for hemophilia and autoimmune disorders from all available sources on a volume discount basis 
we are one of the national assignment of benefits providers selected by medimmune  inc to distribute drugs for respiratory syncytial virus 
during  we began providing specialized contract pharmacy services for the treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension 
we distribute all three of the drug therapies for this disease 
we recognize revenue at the time we ship drugs or when we have performed the contractual service 
while we may experience revenue changes from price fluctuations on our existing product lines  our revenue growth will depend principally on the introduction of new drugs and on volume growth in existing drug lines 
we have five joint venture agreements with various medical centers or their affiliates in which we own of each venture and one joint venture agreement with a medical center affiliate in which we own of the joint venture 
many of our patient populations have diseases that are discovered before or during adolescence and require ongoing care from physician specialists  many of whom are based at pediatric  academic and other acute care medical centers 
to date  these ventures have primarily derived revenues from the treatment of patients with hemophilia  growth hormone related disorders and respiratory syncytial virus 
we share profits and losses with our joint venture partners in equal proportion to our respective equity ownership 
we account for our interests in the net income or loss in our owned joint ventures under the equity method of accounting  and in our owned joint venture under the consolidated method of accounting 
our equity interest in the net income of the owned joint ventures represented approximately 
table of contents  and of our income before income taxes for the years ended june   and  respectively 
cost of sales include drug acquisition costs  pharmacy and warehouse personnel costs  freight and other direct costs associated with the delivery of our products and costs of clinical services provided 
general and administrative expenses include the personnel costs of the reimbursement  sales  marketing  administrative and support staffs as well as corporate overhead and other general expenses 
bad debts include our provision for patient accounts receivable which prove to be uncollectible after routine collection efforts have been exhausted 
we typically hire personnel and incur legal  recruiting  marketing and other expenses in anticipation of the commercial launch of a new biopharmaceutical drug 
in some instances  a portion of these expenses are reimbursed to us by the biopharmaceutical manufacturer 
we have not historically capitalized any of these start up expenses 
due to the increasing sensitivity to drug cost within governmental and non governmental payors  we are continuously susceptible to reimbursement and operating margin pressures 
in recent years  pharmacy benefit managers and other non governmental payors have aggressively attempted to discount their reimbursement rates for our products 
this aggressive discounting has resulted in some reduced margins for some of our products and services 
many government payors  including medicare and medicaid  pay us directly or indirectly for some of the drugs that we sell at the drugs average wholesale price awp or a percentage discount off awp 
recent government investigations into the reporting of awp by drug manufacturers have lead first databank  inc to publish a market price survey of drugs that significantly reduces reimbursement for a number of the clotting factor and ivig products we sell 
a number of state medicaid agencies now pay us for clotting factor at the prices shown on the market price survey or at a percentage discount off those prices 
other states have not changed their pricing structure or have changed back to their pre market price survey reimbursement rates 
in addition  the health care financing administration hcfa had previously announced that medicare intermediaries should calculate the amount that they pay for clotting factor and other drugs by using the lower prices on the first databank market price survey 
however  the medicare intermediaries have not adopted the lower pricing policy to date 
it is possible that all of the medicare intermediaries could adopt the lower pricing at anytime 
both federal and state legislators are continuing to scrutinize the healthcare industry for the purpose of reducing healthcare costs 
while we are unable to predict what  if any  future healthcare reform legislation may be enacted at the federal or state level  we expect continuing pressure to limit expenditures by governmental healthcare programs  which could impact the amount of revenue we receive 
approximately  and of gross patient revenues excluding the acute business acquired from gentiva for the years ended june   and  respectively  was from medicare and state sponsored medicaid programs 
with the purchase of the sps division the percentage of our revenue reimbursed by medicare and medicaid will be higher than the comparable percentages experienced by accredo prior to the acquisition 
acquisition on june   we acquired the specialty pharmaceutical services division sps business of gentiva health services  inc we acquired substantially all of the assets used in the sps business including of the outstanding stock in three of gentiva s subsidiaries that were exclusively in the business conducted by the sps business 
the sps business provides specialized contract pharmacy and related services relating to the treatment of patients with certain costly chronic diseases 
in addition to the diseases previously served by us  the sps business is also a leading provider of contract pharmacy and related services to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension 
as a result of the acquisition  we have become the leading provider of specialized contract pharmacy and related services  measured by revenue 
the aggregate purchase price was million including million of acquisition related costs and consisted of million of cash and  shares of common stock valued at million 
the results of the sps business have been included in the consolidated financial statements since june  
table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated  the percentages of total revenues represented by the respective financial items years ended june  revenues net patient revenue other revenue equity in net income of joint ventures total revenues operating expenses cost of sales general and administrative bad debts restructuring charge depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income interest income expense  net income before minority interest and income taxes minority interest income before income taxes income tax expense net income fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenues 
total revenues increased from million to million from fiscal year to fiscal year acquisitions completed during accounted for million of the increase in total revenues 
net patient revenues increased from million to million from fiscal year to fiscal year acquisitions completed during accounted for million of the increase in net patient revenues 
in fiscal year  we experienced growth in our products for the treatments of multiple sclerosis  growth hormone disorders  hemophilia and gaucher disease and autoimmune disorders as a result of volume growth with the addition of new patients  additional sales of product to existing patients and acquisitions 
we also had a significant increase in our seasonal drug synagis for the treatment of respiratory synctial virus as a result of increased patient volume 
we also benefited from the addition of new and expanded contracts with managed care organizations 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased from million to million from fiscal year to fiscal year  which is commensurate with the increase in our revenues discussed above 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales decreased from to from fiscal year to fiscal year resulting in gross margins of in fiscal year and in fiscal year gross margins for the individual products have remained relatively stable  however  a change in product mix resulted in an increase in the composite gross margin in fiscal year the primary drivers were increased revenues from hemophilia factor  intravenous immunoglobulin ivig for the treatment of autoimmune disorders and flolan for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension  which have lower acquisition costs as a percentage of revenue than most of the other products we distribute 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million to million  or  from fiscal year to fiscal year acquisitions completed during accounted for million of the increase in general and administrative expenses 
the balance of the increase was 
table of contents primarily the result of increased salaries and benefits associated with the expansion of our reimbursement  sales and marketing  administrative and support staffs and the addition of office space and related furniture and fixtures to support the revenue growth 
general and administrative expenses represented and of revenues for fiscal years and  respectively 
bad debts 
bad debts decreased from million to million from fiscal year to fiscal year as a percentage of revenues  bad debt expense decreased from to from fiscal year to fiscal year the decrease in bad debts as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the increased percentage of our revenues that was reimbursed by prescription card benefits versus major medical benefit plans 
the majority of the reimbursement for both avonex and synagis is being provided by prescription card benefit plans  and therefore is subject to much lower co payment and deductible amounts typically per prescription resulting in lower bad debt 
restructuring charge 
in connection with the acquisition of the sps business  we recorded a restructuring charge of million 
the charge includes a million write off of which million is non cash of a software application we were developing that will not be implemented as a result of the decision to enhance and implement company wide the software application acquired with the sps business 
the restructuring charge also includes 
million for future lease commitments that will be abandoned once the facility integration plan related to the acquisition has been completed 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation expense increased from  to  from fiscal year to fiscal year as a result of purchases of property and equipment associated with our revenue growth and the expansion of our leasehold facility improvements 
amortization expense associated with goodwill and other intangible assets decreased from  to  from fiscal year to fiscal year due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  during the first quarter of fiscal year the application of the non amortization of goodwill provisions resulted in a reduction in amortization expense net of income taxes of approximately million or per diluted share 
interest income expense  net 
interest income  net decreased from  to  from fiscal year to fiscal year the decrease is due to a decrease in the average amount of cash invested during the year primarily as a result of cash used for acquisitions and earn out payments related to prior year acquisitions and a decrease in the interest rate earned on the amounts invested 
in addition  we incurred million in debt on june  to acquire the sps business of gentiva health services 
income tax expense 
our effective tax rate decreased from to from fiscal year to fiscal year the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the adoption of the non amortization provisions of sfas discussed above 
the difference between the recognized effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate is primarily attributed to state income taxes 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenues 
total revenues increased from million to million from fiscal year to fiscal year net patient revenues increased from million to million from fiscal year to fiscal year in fiscal year  we experienced growth in our products for the treatments of multiple sclerosis  growth hormone disorders  hemophilia autoimmune disorders and gaucher disease as a result of volume growth with the addition of new patients and additional sales of product to existing patients 
we also had a significant increase in our seasonal drug synagis for the treatment of respiratory synctial virus as a result of increased patient volume 
our sales of intravenous immunoglobulin ivig increased due to the acquisition of pharmacare resources  inc  which added approximately million in revenues during the year ended june  we also benefited from the addition of new and expanded contracts with managed care organizations 
in june  we were selected by aetna us healthcare to be a preferred distributor of injectable medications to aetna us healthcare members and participating physicians 
equity in net income of joint ventures decreased  from fiscal year to fiscal year primarily due to the acquisition of an additional interest in the joint venture childrens hemophilia 
table of contents services effective april  the results of operations of the joint venture have been consolidated with our results of operations since the date of acquisition and  therefore  are no longer recorded using the equity method of accounting 
cost of sales

general and administrative expenses increased from million to million  or  from fiscal year to fiscal year this increase was primarily the result of increased salaries and benefits associated with the expansion of our reimbursement  sales and marketing  administrative and support staffs and the addition of office space and related furniture and fixtures to support the revenue growth 
general and administrative expenses represented and of revenues for fiscal years and  respectively 
bad debts 
bad debts were million in both fiscal years and as a percentage of revenues  bad debt expense decreased from to from fiscal year to fiscal year the decrease in bad debts as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the increased percentage of our revenues that was reimbursed by prescription card benefits versus major medical benefit plans 
the majority of the reimbursement for both avonex and synagis is being provided by prescription card benefit plans  and therefore is subject to much lower co payment and deductible amounts typically per prescription resulting in lower bad debt 
avonex and synagis represented of our revenues in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year depreciation and amortization 
depreciation expense increased from  to  from fiscal year to fiscal year as a result of purchases of property and equipment associated with our revenue growth and the expansion of our leasehold facility improvements 
amortization expense associated with goodwill and other intangible assets increased from  to  from fiscal year to fiscal year due to acquisitions made during fiscal years and interest income expense  net 
interest expense  net amounted to  in fiscal year compared to interest income  net of  in fiscal year this change amounting to  is due to the repayment of our debt with the proceeds of the stock offering completed during the first quarter of fiscal year  the investment of the excess proceeds from the offering and the sale of an interest rate swap for  income tax expense 
our effective tax rate decreased from to from fiscal year to fiscal year the difference between the recognized effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate is primarily attributed to approximately  and  of nondeductible amortization expense in fiscal years and  respectively  and state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources as of june  and june   we had working capital of million and million  respectively 
our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  these increases are due primarily to our net income growth and the timing of the collection of receivables  inventory purchases and payments of accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash used by investing activities was million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  cash used by investing activities in the year ended june  consisted primarily of million for acquisitions most of which related to the acquisition of the sps 
table of contents business  million for purchases of property and equipment  million for net sales of marketable securities and million of undistributed earnings from our joint ventures 
cash used by investing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of million for acquisitions  million for purchases of property and equipment  million for net purchases of marketable securities and million of undistributed earnings from our joint ventures 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  cash provided by financing activities for the year ended june  consisted primarily of million of net borrowings on our credit facility  which was used to acquire the sps business in june cash provided by financing activities for the year ended june  consisted primarily of million of net proceeds from the common stock offering plus million from the proceeds of stock option exercises less million of net repayments on the revolving line of credit 
historically  we have funded our operations and continued internal growth through cash provided by operations 
capital expenditures amounted to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year we anticipate that our capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending june  will consist primarily of additional computer hardware  a fully integrated pharmacy and reimbursement software system and costs to build out and furnish additional space needed to meet the needs of our growth 
we expect the cost of our capital expenditures in fiscal year to be approximately million  exclusive of any acquisitions of businesses 
we expect to fund these expenditures through cash provided by operating activities and or borrowings under the revolving credit agreement with our bank 
in addition  in connection with our acquisition of biopartners in care  inc made during fiscal year  we may be obligated to make up to million in earn out payments during the next twelve months 
during  we amended and restated our million revolving credit facility with bank of america  na and other participating banks to increase the size of the credit facility to million 
the credit facility consists of a million revolving commitment expiring june  a million term loan tranche a term loan due in periodic principal payments through march  and a million term loan tranche b term loan due in periodic principal payments through march as of june   the total amount outstanding under the credit facility was million  which included million under the revolving credit facility  the million tranche a term loan and the million tranche b term loan 
amounts outstanding under the credit agreement bear interest at varying rates based upon a london inter bank offered rate libor or prime rate of interest as selected by us  plus a variable margin rate based upon our leverage ratio as defined by the credit agreement 
our obligations under the credit agreement are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets  including a pledge of all of the common stock or partnership interest of each of our subsidiaries in which we own an or more interest 
the credit agreement contains financial covenants  including requirements to maintain certain ratios with respect to leverage  fixed charge coverage  net worth and asset coverage each as defined in the agreement 
the credit agreement also includes customary affirmative and negative covenants  including covenants relating to transactions with affiliates  uses of proceeds  restrictions on subsidiaries  limitations on indebtedness  limitations on mergers  acquisitions and asset dispositions  limitations on investments  limitations on payment of dividends and stock repurchases  and other distributions 
the credit agreement also contains customary events of default  including events relating to changes in control of our company 
the credit agreement also requires us to enter into an interest rate swap agreement within days of june  to protect against fluctuations in interest rates 
the credit agreement requires the interest rate swap to provide coverage in an amount equal to at least of the outstanding principal amount of the loans 
on july   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement effectively converting for a period of one year million of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings with a fixed rate of  plus the applicable margin rate as determined by the credit agreement 
previously  we had effectively converted  for the period through october   million of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
we had secured a fixed interest rate exclusive of the 
table of contents margin rate using an interest rate swap agreement 
on august   in conjunction with the repayment of the outstanding principal balance of our revolving line of credit  we surrendered our swap agreement and received  in consideration for the early termination of the agreement 
while we anticipate that our cash from operations  along with the short term use of the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our internal operating requirements and growth plans for at least the next months  we expect that additional funds may be required in the future to successfully continue our growth beyond such period 
we may be required to raise additional funds through sales of equity or debt securities or seek additional financing from financial institutions 
there can be no assurance  however  that financing will be available on terms that are favorable to us or  if obtained  will be sufficient for our needs 
the following table sets forth a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of june  the long term debt is reflected on our balance sheet  while the lease commitments are disclosed as future obligations in the notes to the financial statements 
payments due for the year ending june in thousands thereafter long term debt revolving credit facility tranche a term loan tranche b term loan operating leases total critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates  and different assumptions or conditions may yield different estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of the following accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
allowance for doubtful accounts the procedure for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant judgment and assumptions 
our primary collection risks are for patient co payments and deductibles 
the risk of collection varies based upon the product  the payor and the patient s ability to pay the amounts not reimbursed by the payor 
some of the drugs we distribute are primarily reimbursed by prescription card benefit plans  which reimbursement is subject to lower co payment and deductible amounts typically per prescription 
other drugs are primarily reimbursed through major medical benefit plans  which reimbursement is subject to higher deductible amounts 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience of collecting the patient co payments and deductibles 
however  economic and other factors could result in collections that differ from our estimates 
we continually review the estimation process and make changes to the estimates as necessary 

table of contents allowance for contractual discounts we are reimbursed for the drugs we sell by many different payors including insurance companies  medicare and all of the state medicaid programs 
the revenues and related accounts receivable are recorded net of payor contractual discounts to reflect the estimated net billable amounts for the products delivered 
we estimate the allowance for contractual discounts on a payor specific basis  given our interpretation of the contract terms or applicable regulations 
however  the reimbursement rates are often subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates 
additionally  updated regulations and contract negotiations occur frequently  necessitating our continual review and assessment of the estimation process 
medical claims reserves we maintain self insured medical and dental plans for employees 
claims expense is accrued under these plans as the incidents that give rise to them occur 
we use a third party administrator to process all such claims 
unpaid claim accruals are estimated based on historical costs of settlement and average lag times 
we believe that the estimation methodology used effectively captures our medical claims costs  however  payments could differ from our estimates due to changes in the healthcare cost structure or changes in the volume of claims filed 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for under the purchase method 
sfas no 
also sets forth guidelines for applying the purchase method of accounting in the determination of intangible assets  including goodwill acquired in a business combination  and expands financial disclosures concerning business combinations completed after june  the application of sfas no 
did not effect any of our previously reported amounts included in goodwill or other intangible assets 
effective july   we early adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which establishes new accounting and reporting requirements for goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  all goodwill amortization ceased effective july  and goodwill was tested for impairment 
impairment tests are required to be performed at the date of adoption of sfas and at least annually thereafter 
absent any impairment indicators  we perform our annual impairment tests during the fourth quarter 
the impairment tests performed at adoption and in the fourth quarter of resulted in no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
removes goodwill from its scope and clarifies other implementation issues related to sfas no 
sfas no 
also provides a single framework for evaluating long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
the provisions of this statement will be effective in our fiscal year we do not expect the application of this new accounting standard to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 recission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
requires gains and losses on extinguishment of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as previously required under sfas no 
sfas no 
also amends sfas no 
to require certain modifications to capital leases treated as a sale leaseback and modifies the accounting for sub leases when the original lessee remains a secondary obligor or guarantor 
the provisions of this statement are generally effective for years beginning after may  in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employer termination benefits 
table of contents and other costs to exit an activity 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  impact of inflation changes in prices charged by the biopharmaceutical manufacturers for the drugs we dispense  along with increasing labor costs  freight and supply costs and other overhead expenses  affect our cost of sales and general and administrative expenses 
historically  we have been able to pass all  or a portion  of the effect of such increases to the biopharmaceutical manufacturers pursuant to negotiated adjustments made under our preferred distribution agreements 
as a result  changes due to inflation have not had significant adverse effects on our operations 
forward looking information certain matters discussed in the preceding pages of this form k  particularly regarding implementation of the our strategy  development of new drugs by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  anticipated growth and revenues  anticipated working capital and sources of funding for growth opportunities  expenditures  interest  costs and income constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended see item risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to the impact of financial market risk is significant 
our primary financial market risk exposure consists of interest rate risk related to interest that we are obligated to pay on our variable rate debt 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage some of our exposure to rising interest rates on our variable rate debt  primarily by entering into variable to fixed interest rate swaps 
we have fixed the interest rate through july  on million of our variable rate debt through the use of a variable to fixed interest rate swap 
as a result  we will not benefit from any decrease in interest rates nor will we be subjected to any detriment from rising interest rates on this portion of our debt during the period of the swap agreement 
accordingly  a basis point decrease in interest rates along the entire yield curve would not increase pre tax income by million for the year as would be expected without this financial instrument 
however  a basis point increase in interest rates along the entire yield curve would also not decrease pre tax income by million for the same period as a result of using this derivative financial instrument 
for the remaining portion of our variable rate debt  we have not hedged against our interest rate risk exposure 
as a result  we will benefit from decreasing interest rates  but we will also be harmed by rising interest rates on this portion of our debt 
accordingly  if we maintain our current level of total debt  a basis point decrease in interest rates along the entire yield curve would result in an increase in pre tax income of approximately million for the year 
however  a basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in pre tax income of million for the same period 
actual changes in rates may differ from the hypothetical assumptions used in computing the exposures in the examples cited above
