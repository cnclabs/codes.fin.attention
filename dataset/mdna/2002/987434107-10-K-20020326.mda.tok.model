item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction the operating revenue of the company s stations are derived primarily from advertising revenue and  to a much lesser extent  from compensation paid by the networks to the stations for broadcasting network programming 
the stations primary operating expenses are for employee compensation  news gathering  production  programming and promotion costs 
a high proportion of the operating expenses of the stations are fixed 
advertising is sold for placement within and adjoining a station s network and locally originated programming 
advertising is sold in time increments and is priced primarily on the basis of a program s popularity among the specific audience an advertiser desires to reach  as measured principally by periodic audience surveys 
in addition  advertising rates are affected by the number of advertisers competing for the available time  the size and demographic makeup of the market served by the station and the availability of alternative advertising media in the market area 
rates are highest during the most desirable viewing hours  with corresponding reductions during other hours 
the ratings of a local station affiliated with a national television network can be affected by ratings of network programming 
most advertising contracts are short term  and generally run only for a few weeks 
approximately of the annual gross revenue of the company s stations was generated from local advertising  which is sold by a station s sales staff directly to local accounts 
the remainder of the advertising revenue primarily represents national advertising  which is sold by adam young inc ayi  a national advertising sales representative  which was merged into the company in february the stations generally pay commissions to advertising agencies on local  regional and national advertising 
the advertising revenue of the company s stations are generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year  due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to  and including  the holiday season 
in addition  advertising revenue is generally higher during even numbered election years due to spending by political candidates  which spending typically is heaviest during the fourth quarter 
the company defines broadcast cash flow as operating income before income taxes and interest income and expense  plus depreciation and amortization including amortization of program license rights  non cash compensation and corporate overhead  less payments for program license liabilities 
other television broadcasting companies may measure broadcast cash flow in a different manner 
the company has included broadcast cash flow data because such data are commonly used as a measure of performance for broadcast companies and are also used by investors to measure a company s ability to service debt 
broadcast cash flow is not  and should not be used as  an indicator or alternative to operating income  net income or cash flow as reflected in the consolidated financial statements  is not intended to represent funds available for debt service  dividends  reinvestment or other discretionary uses  is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the following table sets forth certain operating data for the years ended december   and year ended december  dollars in thousands operating income    add amortization of program license rights    depreciation and amortization    corporate overhead    non cash compensation paid in common stock    less payments for program license liabilities    broadcast cash flow    critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with u 
s generally accepted accounting principles 
the company s financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect its financial position and results of operations 
the company s critical accounting policy with respect to revenue recognition is its determination as to the collectibility of account receivable from advertisers 
the nature of the business does not lend itself to a concentration of receivables from individual customers 
experience has been that customer defaults are significantly lower than the company s accrual of bad debt expense and that the allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate to cover the likely exposure to such defaults 
the company s accounting for long lived program assets requires judgment as to the likelihood that such assets will generate sufficient revenue to cover the associated expense 
many of the company s program commitments are for syndicated shows which are produced by syndicators to be aired on a first run basis 
such shows do not generally stay in production if they do not attract a significant audience 
if the syndicator cancels a show  the company s liability for future payments is eliminated 
accordingly  the company has generally not experienced significant write downs from programming commitments 
the company s critical accounting for the impairment of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets is assessing the recoverability by making assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or related assumptions materially change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded for these assets 
at december   the company had million in net property  plant and equipment and  million in broadcast licenses and other intangibles  primarily goodwill and fcc licenses 
during  the company did not record any impairment losses related to property  plant and equipment or broadcast licenses and other intangibles

 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas  effective for fiscal years beginning after june  this standard provides the accounting for the cost of legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets
