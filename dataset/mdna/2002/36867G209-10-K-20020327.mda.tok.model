item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview genaera corporation is a biopharmaceutical company committed to developing medicines for serious diseases from genomics and natural products 
our research and development efforts are focused on anti angiogenesis  respiratory diseases  obesity  and infectious diseases 
we changed our name from magainin pharmaceuticals inc to genaera corporation on march  since commencing operations in  we have not generated any revenue from product sales  and we have funded operations primarily from the proceeds of public and private placements of securities and research and development collaboration payments and related equity investments 
we have incurred a loss in each year since our inception  and we expect to incur substantial additional losses for at least the next several years 
we expect that losses may fluctuate  and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
at december   our accumulated deficit was approximately  we will need to raise additional funds in the future to continue our operations 
the following discussion is included to describe our financial position and results of operations for each of the previous three years in the period ended december  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
critical accounting policies and estimates the sec recently released cautionary advice regarding critical accounting policies 
the sec has defined critical policies and practices as items that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows revenue recognition contract revenue for research and development is recorded as earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
non refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and for which there is no continuing involvement by us  are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees and certain guaranteed payments where we continue involvement through development collaboration is recognized on a straight line basis over the development period 
revenue associated with performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements 
revenue under r d cost reimbursement contracts or government grants is recognized as the related costs are incurred 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as liabilities until earned 
payments received that are refundable also are classified as liabilities until the refund provision expires 
we make an estimate as to the appropriate deferral period for recognition of revenue on any collaborative fees received 
changes in these estimates  due to the evolution of the development program  can have a significant effect on the timing of revenue recorded 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include related salaries  contractor fees  and facility costs 
r d expenses consist of independent r d contract costs  contract manufacturing costs and costs associated with collaborative r d arrangements 
in addition  we fund r d at other research institutions under agreements that are generally cancelable 
r d expenses also include external activities such as investigator sponsored trials 
all such costs are charged to r d expense systematically as incurred  which may be measured by percentage of completion  contract milestones  patient enrollment or the passage of time 
at the initiation of certain contracts  we must make an estimate as to the duration and expected completion date of the contract  which may require a change due to accelerations  delays or other adjustments to the contract period or work performed 
changes in these estimates could have a significant effect on the amount of r d costs in a specific period 
stock based compensation we account for stock based employee compensation under the intrinsic value based method set forth by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
effective january   we adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
stock or other equity based compensation for non employees must be accounted for under the fair value based method as required by sfas no 
and emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  and other related interpretations 
under this method  the equity based instrument is valued at either the fair value of the consideration received or the equity instrument issued on the date of grant 
the resulting compensation cost is recognized and charged to operations over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
estimating the fair value of equity securities involves a number of judgments and variables that are subject to significant change 
a change in the fair value estimate could have a significant effect on the amount of compensation cost 
results of operations revenues we have received no revenues from product sales 
revenues recorded to date have consisted principally of revenues recognized under collaborations with third parties 
in april  we entered into a research collaboration and licensing agreement with medimmune to develop and commercialize therapies related to our il program 
medimmune is expected to fund at least million for our research and development activities through april  payable in eight equal quarterly installments 
for the year ended december   we recognized  in revenue related to this agreement 
research and development expenses we recognized research and development expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
research and development expenses consist principally of personnel costs  contract research  development and manufacturing costs and facility costs 
research and development expenses increased in the year ended december   as compared to the same period a year ago  due to ongoing squalamine development efforts as well as additional preclinical and development activities in our trodulamine formerly referred to as produlestan  il antibody and mucoregulator programs 
research and development expenses increased in the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due to increases in squalamine development  clinical and manufacturing activity as well as preclinical and development activity in our mucoregulator  il antibody and trodulamine programs 
the level of research and development expenses in future periods will depend principally upon the progress of our research and development programs and our capital resources 
general and administrative expenses we recognized general and administrative expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel costs  professional fees and public company expenses 
such expenses have increased in the year ended december   as compared to the same period a year ago  due principally to increases in personnel related to general corporate activities  including business development 
general and administrative expenses decreased marginally in as compared to the prior year due principally to a moderate decrease in personnel and professional fees 
other income and expense we recognized other income of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we recognized other expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
other income is primarily comprised of interest income generated from cash and investments 
other expense is primarily comprised of interest expense related to our indebtedness to a bank and  through february  the recognition of interest expense on the accretion from a discounted value to face value of the long term obligation to abbott laboratories 
interest income decreased slightly during the year ended december   as compared to the same period a year ago  due to declining investment interest yields  substantially offset by higher average investment balances 
interest income increased slightly during the year ended december   as compared to the prior year  due to higher investment balances 
interest expense decreased during the year ended december   as compared to the prior year  due to rate decreases and our no longer recognizing additional interest expense on the long term obligation to abbott subsequent to february this obligation is now recorded at its face value 
interest expense increased during the year ended december   as compared to the prior year  due to recognizing additional interest expense on the long term obligation to abbott 
liquidity and capital resources cash and investments were million at december  as compared to million at december  the primary use of cash was to finance our operations 
since inception  we have funded our operations primarily from the proceeds of public and private placements of our securities totaling approximately million since our initial public offering in december and including the following offerings in  and 
 raised from a public offering completed in october  
 raised from a private placement completed in may  
 raised from a private placement completed in august  
 raised from a private placement in december  and 
 raised from a private placement completed in april in addition to the above  we have funded our operations from contract and grant revenues  research and development expense reimbursements  interest income  lease financing and debt financing 
our goal is to conduct significant research  pre clinical development  clinical testing and manufacturing activities over the next several years 
we expect that these activities  together with projected general and administrative expenses  will result in continued and significant losses 
current liabilities decreased by  to million at december   due to the million payment of our short term obligation to abbott in the first quarter of offset partially by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses resulting from the timing of our development contracts 
prior to  we had an agreement with abbott providing for the purchase of approximately million of bulk drug substance for locilex tm cream 
as fda approval of locilex tm cream did not occur  we renegotiated this agreement with abbott in  paying abbott million and receiving partial delivery of material 
an additional million was due to abbott and payable if we receive in excess of million of additional funds in any year beginning in  in which case of such excess over million shall be payable to abbott 
we have no further purchase commitments to abbott  and abbott has no further supply requirements to us 
as a result of our financing activities during and other cash inflows  million of this liability was payable and paid to abbott on march  as a result of our financing activities during and other cash inflows   of this liability becomes payable to abbott on march  and thus has been included in current liabilities at december  the remaining amount of million due to abbott is included in long term liabilities as of december  long term accrued development expense decreased by  to million at december  due to the transfer of a portion of the amount owed abbott to current liabilities 
under the terms of our million bank debt  we make monthly interest only payments at an annual rate of  with principal due in june our current intention is to refinance this loan prior to its maturity 
we maintain cash and investments of million as collateral for the obligation 
our capital expenditure requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development programs  the time and cost required to obtain regulatory approvals  our ability to enter into additional collaborative arrangements  the demand for products based on our technology  if and when such products are approved  and possible acquisitions of products  technologies and companies 
we had no significant capital commitments as of december  in april  we entered into a research collaboration and licensing agreement and a preferred stock purchase agreement with medimmune  inc pursuant to which we received million 
medimmune is expected to fund at least million for our research and development activities through april  of which  has been received through december  of that amount   was recognized as revenue and the remaining  was included in other current liabilities 
we expect our level of research and development spending in to be approximately the same as in after considering the medimmune transaction  and in the absence of raising additional funds or significantly reducing expenses  we believe we will have sufficient resources to sustain operations through however  we will need to raise substantial additional funds in the future to continue our research and development programs beyond and to commercialize our potential products 
if we are unable to raise such funds  we may be unable to complete our development activities for any of our proposed products 
we regularly explore alternative means of financing our operations and seek funding through various sources  including public and private securities offerings  collaborative arrangements with third parties and other strategic alliances and business transactions 
we currently do not have any commitments to obtain additional funds  and may be unable to obtain sufficient funding in the future on acceptable terms 
if we cannot obtain funding  we will need to delay  scale back or eliminate research and development programs or enter into collaborations with third parties to commercialize potential products or technologies that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves  or seek other arrangements 
if we engage in collaborations  we may receive lower consideration upon commercialization of such products than if we had not entered into such arrangements  or if we entered into such arrangements at later stages in the product development process 
additional factors that may impact our ability to raise capital are described under risk factors related to our business 
contractual cash obligations the table below sets forth our contractual obligations at december  in thousands cash payments due by period less after than contractual cash obligations total year years years years bank debt   abbott settlement   operating lease on building  operating leases and maintenance contracts on equipment r d contracts clinical trial contracts manufacturing contracts total contractual cash obligations    we maintain cash and investments of approximately  as collateral for this obligation 
our current intention is to refinance this obligation prior to its maturity 
payable if we receive in excess of million of additional funds in any year beginning in  in which case of such excess over million shall be payable to abbott 
the lease provides for escalations relating to increases in the consumer price index not to exceed but no less than beginning in december we have assumed a minimum lease payment escalation of for the purposes of this table 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued two statements as a result of its deliberations on the business combinations project  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
 which eliminates the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting  is effective for any business combinations initiated after june  and also includes the criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill 
sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and will require that goodwill and certain intangibles not be amortized  but rather be subject to an impairment test at least annually 
sfas nos 
and will not have an impact on our historical financial statements at adoption as we currently do not have any intangible assets or goodwill 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with interest rate changes 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we invest in only us government debt instruments that meet high quality credit standards  as specified in our investment policy 
the policy also limits the amount of credit exposure we may have to any one issue  issuer or type of investment 
as of december   our portfolio investments consisted of million in cash and million in u 
s government debt instruments having a maturity of less than one year 
due to the nature of our investment portfolio  management believes that a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that if the average annualized yield of our investments had decreased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased by approximately  this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the annualized yield of each investment instrument by basis points 
the impact on our future interest income will depend largely on the gross amount of our investment portfolio 
we do not currently have any significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk
