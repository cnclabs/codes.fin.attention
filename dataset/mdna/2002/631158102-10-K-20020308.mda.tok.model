fiscal vs 
revenues total revenues for were billion compared to billion for  a decrease of 
the revenue decline was primarily due to the consolidation of distribution centers in which were part of the company s strategic plan to close underutilized facilities and concentrate sales volume into existing distribution centers  thereby improving efficiency  service and distribution costs to the retailer 
in  this strategy was a factor in the company attracting new food distribution and military business 
the distribution of revenues by operating segment is as follows operating segments food distribution retail military food distribution segment revenues for the year were billion compared to billion in  a decrease of 
the decline was largely attributed to two factors the closure of five distribution centers in  resulting in a loss of volume and the acquisitions of two previous food distribution customers  hinky dinky supermarkets  inc hinky dinky in january and erickson s diversified corporation erickson s in june  which resulted in the reporting of revenues in the retail segment instead of the food distribution segment 
during the last half of  the company successfully gained the food distribution business of food farm  inc  a consortium of piggly wiggly stores in the southeast  representing more than million in annualized revenues 
retail segment revenues were billion for the year  compared to million last year  an increase of 
the improvement was largely the result of the acquisition of the store hinky dinky chain in nebraska in january  the opening of new replacement stores in marshalltown and cedar rapids  iowa  an additional store in rochester  minnesota and the acquisition of three conventional stores in the midwest 
in addition  the acquisition of stores operated by erickson s in june also contributed to the favorable year over year comparison 
same store sales for the year were relatively flat compared to last year 
during the year the company s corporate store count changed as follows fiscal year number of stores at beginning of year new stores acquired stores closed or sold stores number of stores at end of year military segment revenues for the year were million compared to million  an increase of 
the improvement for the year partially reflected the addition of new distribution business in europe and north carolina  awarded to the company in the third quarter by a major manufacturer 
gross margins gross margins were in  compared to in the increase in over the last year reflects the growth in the proportion of higher margin retail revenues 
in addition  efficiencies in warehousing and transportation resulting from facility consolidations  operational and system improvements favorably impacted gross margins 
the company implemented processes to continuously monitor costs by analyzing key measures of operating performance such as delivery equipment utilization  on time deliveries  product fill rates and the cost per case of handling and shipping goods  against predetermined standards 
improvements in product procurement resulted from leveraging the company s buying power through three regional procurement offices and partnering with vendors to implement more effective merchandising programs also contributed to improved gross margins 
in  the company recorded a lifo credit of million compared to a credit of 
million in although the company believes that there was inflation in product pricing  it has experienced deflation in costs of products due to efficiencies and economies brought about by leveraging volume and improvements in its procurement processes 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenues were in compared to in the increase in over was substantially due to the increasing proportion of corporate owned retail business  which typically operates at higher expense levels as a percent of revenues than does the food distribution segment 
during  the company recorded an additional provision for bad debts of million  compared to million last year 
the increase relates primarily to certain accounts within the michigan and ohio market areas  where the company has focused efforts to minimize credit risks 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense for the year was million compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase primarily reflected a full year s depreciation and goodwill amortization expense related to the acquisitions of erickson s and hinky dinky 
in addition  an expansion of the lumberton  north carolina distribution center and the construction of seven new stores and remodeled stores during the year also contributed to the increased expense 
interest expense interest expense for was million compared to in  an increase of 
the higher interest costs are attributed to higher average borrowing rates which were in compared to in in addition  average revolving debt levels increased in  resulting from the acquisition of hinky dinky and various major capital expansion projects  which also contributed to the higher interest costs 
net earnings net earnings for increased to million  or per diluted share  excluding non recurring items compared to million  or 
per diluted share  in  excluding non recurring items 
the improvement over can be attributed to a number of factors the successful integration of the hinky dinky stores  the continued strong performance by the erickson s stores  efficiency gains and new business in the food distribution segment 
including the reversal of restructuring charges  non recurring gains on the sales of the company s produce growing and marketing subsidiary  nash decamp  and majority investments in two dairy operations as well as the write off of unamortized financing costs in  net earnings were million or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share last year

ebitda the company s new revolving credit facility contains various restrictive covenants 
several of these covenants are based on earnings from operations before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and non recurring items ebitda 
the ability to generate ebitda sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the credit facility is an important measure of the company s financial strategy 
this information is not intended as an alternative to performance measures under generally accepted accounting principles  but rather as a presentation important for understanding the company s performance relative to its debt covenants 
as of december   the company is in compliance with all ebitda based debt covenants 
the following is a summary of the calculation of ebitda in thousands for  and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and extraordinary charge    special charges reversals  lifo effect   depreciation and amortization    interest expense    gain on sale of dairies  other non recurring items total ebitda    critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying certain critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those that require the most subjective and complex judgments 
the following are considered by the company to be critical and could result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions allowance for doubtful accounts methodology we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts and notes receivable based on a combination of factors 
in most circumstances when we become aware of factors that may indicate a deterioration in a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  reductions of product purchases  deteriorating store conditions  changes in payment patterns  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
if circumstances change ie  further evidence of material adverse credit worthiness  additional accounts become credit risks  store closures  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount  including to zero 
guarantees of debt and lease obligations of others we have guaranteed the debt and lease obligations of certain of our food distribution customers 
in the event these retailers are unable to meet their debt service payments or otherwise experience an event of default  we would be unconditionally liable for the outstanding balance of their debt and lease obligations million as of december   which would be due in accordance with the underlying agreements 
triggering the guarantee would not however  result in cross default of the company debt  but could restrict resources available for general business initiatives 
debt covenants our debt agreements require us to maintain certain financial ratios and a minimum level of net worth as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have complied with these covenants as of december  we believe maintaining our current level of operating results makes the likelihood of defaulting on our debt covenants unlikely absent any material negative event affecting the us economy as a whole 
we also believe our lenders would provide us waivers if necessary 
however  our expectations of future operating results and continued compliance with our debt covenants cannot be assured and our lender s actions are not controllable by us 
if our projections of future operating performance are not achieved and our debt is placed in default  we would experience a material adverse impact on our reported financial position and results of operations 
lease commitments the company has historically leased store sites for sublease to qualified independent retailers  at rates that are at least as high as the rent paid by the company 
the company also leases store sites for its retail segment 
under terms of the original lease agreements  the company remains primarily liable for any commitments a retailer may no longer be financially able to satisfy as well as those of its own stores 
should a retailer be unable to perform under the sublease or should the company close underperforming corporate stores  the company records a charge to earnings for costs of the remaining term of the lease  less any anticipated sublease income 
more often than not  the company has been able to re sublease such locations to other qualified retailers with minimal interruption of sublease recoveries and cost to the company 
should the number of defaults by sublessees or corporate store closures increase  the remaining lease commitments the company must record could have a material adverse effect on operating results and cash flows 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of lease commitments 
impairment of long lived assets impairment losses are recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable 
the company considers historical performance and estimated future results in its evaluation of potential impairment 
future results are often influenced by assessments of changes in competition  merchandising strategies  human resources and general market conditions  which may result in not recognizing an impairment loss 
no assurance can be given that these assessments and implementation of any resulting initiatives will result in profit margins sufficient to recover the carrying value of long lived assets 
deferred tax assets as of december   we have approximately million of net deferred tax assets related principally to obligations to be settled in future periods for which no valuation allowance has been recorded 
the realization of these net assets is based primarily upon estimates of future taxable income 
current operating results are sufficient to sustain realization of these net assets 
however  should significant reductions in taxable income occur  realization of net tax assets may be prevented 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has financed capital needs through a combination of internal and external sources 
these sources include cash flow from operations  short term bank borrowings  various types of long term debt and lease and equity financing 
operating cash flows were million during compared to million in and million in the changes in operating cash flows in were primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities 
accounts receivable increased due to the discontinuance of a receivables securitization program 
the lower cash flows in were primarily due to cash commitments under the special charges offset by reductions in accounts receivable and inventories 
working capital was million at the end of compared to at the end of  a decrease of million  reflecting management s efforts to minimize its investment in operating assets 
cash used for investing activities for the year were million compared to million in  and million in investing activities in consisted primarily of the following business acquisitions of million  primarily attributed to u save  and capital expenditures of million 
investing activities for included capital expenditures of million  business acquisitions of million  which consisted of hinky dinky and three stores in the midwest  and loans to customers  net of payments received  totaling million 
in  investing activities included capital expenditures of million  business acquisitions of million consisting of erickson s and two stores each in south carolina and wyoming  offset by cash proceeds of million from the sale of nash decamp and two dairy operations 
the company has funded investing activities from both cash generated from operations and its revolving credit facilities 
it expects to continue to use these as its principle sources of future funding 
the company has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond these commitments include long term debt and capital and operating lease obligations  primarily related to store locations for the company s retail segment  as well as store locations subleased to independent food distribution customers 
the following summarizes these contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total less than year years years over years long term debt      capital lease obligations      operating leases      total contractual cash obligations     the  shown as scheduled for payment in years includes repayment of the revolving credit facility based on the current outstanding balance of  typically  the company is able to refinance the credit facility with a new agreement either before or upon maturity of the current agreement

a discussion of lease commitments can be found in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and lease commitments under critical accounting policies  above 
includes amounts classified as imputed interest 
the company also has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond these commitments include standby letters of credit and guarantees of certain food distribution customer debt and lease obligations 
the following summarizes these commitments as of december  commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments total amounts committed less than year years years over years standby letters of credit   guarantees     letters of credit relate primarily to supporting workers compensation obligations and are renewable annually 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements and guarantees of debt and lease obligation under critical accounting policies  above  for additional information regarding debt and lease guarantees 
in december  the company completed the refinancing of a revolving credit facility 
the agreement has a five year term and provides a million term loan and million in revolving credit 
borrowings under the term loan bear interest at the eurodollar rate plus a margin increase and a commitment commission on the unused portion of the revolver 
the margin increase and the commitment commission are reset quarterly based on movement of a leverage ratio defined by the agreement 
at december  the margin and commitment commission were and  respectively  compared to and 
at the end of the new agreement contains financial covenants which among other matters requires the company to maintain predetermined ratio levels related to interest coverage  fixed charges  leverage and working capital 
in december  the company entered into three swap agreements to manage interest rates on a portion of its long term debt 
the agreements which expire in six  twelve and eighteen month intervals  are each based on notional amounts of million and fix interest rates at  and for the respective time intervals
