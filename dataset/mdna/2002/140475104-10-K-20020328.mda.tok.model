item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis addresses the company s results of operations on a historical consolidated basis for the years ended december   and the following should be read in conjunction with the company s historical consolidated financial statements and the selected financial data contained elsewhere in this report 
the company is one of the largest operators of senior living communities in the united states in terms of resident capacity 
the company s operating strategy is to provide high quality senior living services at an affordable price to its residents  while achieving and sustaining a strong  competitive position within its chosen markets  as well as to continue to enhance the performance of its operations 
the company provides a wide array of senior living services to the elderly at its communities  including independent living  assisted living with special programs and living units at some of its communities for residents with alzheimer s and other forms of dementia  skilled nursing and home care services 
during the years through  the company acquired interests in and continues to own communities and expanded its senior living management services by entering into management service contracts on nine communities for two independent third party owners and provided development and construction management services for new residence properties in addition to adding a home care service agency 
the company generates revenue from a variety of sources 
for the year ended december   the company s revenues were derived as follows from the operation of owned communities  from lease rentals from triple net leases  from management fees arising from management services provided for affiliate owned senior living communities and nine third party owned senior living communities  and from development fees earned for managing the development and construction of new senior living communities for affiliate owned senior living communities 
the company believes that the factors affecting the financial performance of communities managed under contracts with third parties do not vary substantially from the factors affecting the performance of owned and leased communities  although there are different business risks associated with these activities 
the company s third party management fees are primarily based on a percentage of gross revenues 
as a result  the cash flow and profitability of such contracts to the company are more dependent on the revenues generated by such communities and less dependent on net cash flow than for owned communities 
further  the company is not responsible for capital investments in managed communities 
while the management contracts are generally terminable only for cause  in certain cases the contracts can be terminated for not choosing to optionally fund operating deficits and upon the sale of a community  subject to the company s rights to offer to purchase such community 
the company s current management contracts expire on various dates through june and provide for management fees based generally upon rates that vary by contract from of net revenues to of net revenues 
in addition  certain of the contracts provide for supplemental incentive fees that vary by contract based upon the financial performance of the managed community 
the company s development fees are generally based upon a percentage of construction cost and are earned over the period commencing with the initial development activities and ending with the opening of the community 
during  and  the company paid approximately million  million  and million  respectively  for partnership interests in hcp 
as a result of additional purchases  the company s ownership interest in hcp exceeded on june  and was at december  accordingly  this partial acquisition has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting  and the assets  liabilities  minority interest  and the results of operations of hcp have been consolidated in the company s financial statements since january  the company  through its ownership in hcp  leased two properties under triple net leases at december  subsequent to the end of the company s fiscal year  these properties were sold for million 
after the sale of these properties  hcp owns one community that is currently classified as held for sale 
the company acquired  on november   the nhp notes owned by an affiliate of the company in the formation transactions for million 
the nhp notes bear simple interest at per annum and matured on december  interest is paid quarterly at a rate of  with the remaining interest deferred 
from november  through september   the company recorded interest income at of the purchase price paid  which was determined based on the discounted amount of principal and interest payments to be made following the maturity date december  of the nhp notes using a six month lag between maturity and full repayment  due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate realization of the accrued interest 
on september   the company purchased four properties from nhp 
nhp in turn redeemed million of the company s investment in the nhp notes and distributed approximately million of deferred interest not previously paid on such notes 
from october  through december   the company reevaluated its investment in the nhp notes and began recording additional income after giving consideration to current payment of interest  partial redemption of the nhp notes with accrued interest and the estimated residual value in nhp 
this change in estimate resulted in million of additional income in in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reevaluated the assumptions related to its investment in the nhp notes  and as a result reduced the income expected to be earned from the nhp notes 
this change in estimate resulted in a million reduction in interest income in the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  the company reevaluated its assumptions related to the nhp notes  and as a result  reduced interest income in the fourth quarter by million 
at december   the company s effective interest rate on the nhp notes was 
subsequent to december   nhp distributed its available cash and proceeds from the sale of its community in buffalo  new york to the nhp note holders 
the company received million of this distribution as a payment on its nhp notes 
the company formed the bre csl joint venture with blackstone in december  and the joint venture will seek to acquire in excess of million of senior housing properties 
bre csl is owned by blackstone and by the company 
pursuant to the terms of the joint venture  each of the company and blackstone must approve any acquisitions made by the joint venture 
each party must also contribute its pro rata portion of the costs of any acquisition 
on december   the venture acquired its first property  the amberleigh at woodside farms  a resident capacity independent living facility  from nhp 
in connection with the acquisition by bre csl the company contributed million to the venture 
the company expects to recover approximately million of its contribution to bre csl when permanent financing is obtained for the amberleigh community 
in addition  the company has entered into a contribution agreement to contribute four of its senior living communities to the joint venture 
the company will manage these communities once owned by the joint venture under long term management contracts 
the company is developing two communities both of which are expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal and will seek to acquire additional senior living communities through the bre csl joint venture it established with blackstone 
the development of senior living communities typically involves a substantial commitment of capital over an approximate month construction period during which time no revenues are generated  followed by a to month lease up period 
the company anticipates that newly opened or expanded communities will operate at a loss during a substantial portion of the lease up period 
the company s growth strategy may also include the acquisition of senior living communities  home care agencies and other properties or businesses that are complementary to the company s operations and growth strategy 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related footnotes 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience  observance of industry trends and various other sources of information and factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition resident and health care revenue is recognized at estimated net realizable amounts  based on historical experiences  due from residents in the period to which the rental and other services are provided 
revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs accounted for of the company s net revenues 
under the medicare program  payments are determined based on established rates that differ from private pay rates 
revenue from the medicare program is recorded at established rates and adjusted for differences between such rates and estimated amounts payable from the program 
any differences between estimated and actual reimbursements are included in operations in the year of settlement  which have not been material 
under the medicaid program  communities are entitled to reimbursement at established rates that are lower than private pay rates 
patient service revenue for medicaid patients is recorded at the reimbursement rates as the rates are set prospectively by the state upon the filing of an annual cost report 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation 
the company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and is not aware of any pending or threatened investigations involving allegations of potential wrongdoing 
while no such regulatory inquiries have been made  compliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to future government review and interpretation as well as significant regulatory action including fines  penalties  and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 
management services revenue and development fees are recognized when earned 
management services revenue relates to providing certain management and administrative support services under management contracts 
the company s management contracts include contingent management services revenue  usually based on exceeding certain gross revenue targets 
these contingent revenues are recognized based on actual results according to the calculations specified in the various management agreements 
investments in partnerships triad entities 
the company holds a interest in each of the triad entities and accounts for its investment in the triad entities under the equity method of accounting 
the company has loan commitments to the triad entities for construction and pre marketing expenses  in addition to requirements to fund the triad entities operating deficits through an operating deficit guarantee provided for in its management agreement with the triad entities 
the company evaluates the carrying value of these receivables by comparing the discounted cash flows expected from the operations of the triad entities  to the carrying value of the receivables 
these cash flow models consider lease up rates  expected operating costs  debt service requirements and various other factors 
management believes  based on the assumptions used in these cash flow models  that the notes receivable are fully recoverable during the term of the company s management contract with the triad entities 
under equity accounting  the company has recognized losses in the triad entities of million as of december  the recognition of these losses have reduced the company s investments in the triad entities to zero and additional losses of million have been recorded as a reduction to the company s notes receivable from the triad entities 
the company s share of future losses will also be recorded as a reduction of notes receivable from the triad entities 
bre csl 
during the fourth quarter of  the company formed the bre csl joint venture with blackstone  which will seek to acquire in excess of million of senior housing properties 
the venture is owned by blackstone and by the company 
the company accounts for its investment in this joint venture under the equity method of accounting 
the company recorded its investment at cost and will adjust its investment for its share of earnings and losses of bre csl 
assets held for sale the company determines the fair value  net of costs of disposal  of an asset on the date the asset is categorized as held for sale  and the asset is recorded at the lower of its fair value  net of cost of disposal  or carrying value on that date 
the company periodically reevaluates assets held for sale to determine if the assets are still recorded at the lower of fair value  net of cost of disposal  or carrying value 
the company currently has one community and six parcels of land held for sale 
the fair value of these properties is generally determined based on market rates  industry trends and recent comparable sales transactions 
the actual sales price of these assets could differ significantly from the company s estimates
