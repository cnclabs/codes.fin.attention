item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements  including  without limitation  our expectations regarding revenues  expenses and results of operations 
our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the risk factors section  and below 
we assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements or such risk factors 
revenues our revenues consist of royalty revenues and contract revenues generated from four types of agreements with semiconductor and system companies 
these four types of agreements are licenses for devices fully compatible with the rdram memory interface rdram licenses  licenses for our raser interface that licensees integrate into their logic semiconductors  licenses that cover the use of rambus patents and other intellectual property in synchronous dram sdram and double data rate ddr memory devices and controllers which control such memory  and our september patent cross license with intel 
as of september   our deferred revenue from rdram  raser  sdram and ddr compatible and yellowstone licenses was million  substantially all of which is scheduled to be recognized in varying amounts over the next four years 
royalty revenues royalty revenues are generated by each of the four types of agreements 
royalties can be a fixed quarterly amount  a percentage of the revenues received by licensees on their sales of licensed semiconductors or a dollar amount per link in the case of raser 
we recognize royalties from a licensee in the quarter in which we receive the report detailing shipments of the semiconductors containing rambus technology by such licensee in the prior quarter 
as we have increased our license offerings  we have become increasingly flexible in the type of license agreements 
for fiscal year  over half of our royalties were based on contracts that required fixed quarterly payments for various periods of time 
the exact rate and structure of a royalty arrangement with a particular licensee depend on a number of factors  including the amount of the license fee to be paid by the licensee and  in the case of memory interface licenses  the marketing and engineering commitment made by the licensee 
rdram and raser 
royalties for rdram and raser are normally payable quarterly by a rambus licensee on sales that occur during the life of the rambus patents being licensed 
in the case of rdram licenses  the exact rate and structure of royalty arrangements with specific licensees depend on a number of factors  including the amount of the license fee and the marketing and engineering commitment made by the licensee 
in the case of raser interface licenses  the exact royalty rate and structure vary based on a number of factors  including volume and required customization 
sdram and ddr compatible 
in the case of sdram compatible and ddr compatible licenses  royalties are normally payable over a five year contract period 
sdram compatible and ddr compatible licenses generally provide for the payment of fees which include compensation for use of rambus patents from the time we notify the licensee of potential infringement 
accordingly  we classify these fees as royalty revenues that are recognized ratably over the five year contract period 
the excess of payments received over royalty revenue recognized is shown on our balance sheet as deferred revenue 
except with regard to two licensees with amended agreements  royalties for sdram and ddr compatible licenses are calculated based on a percentage of the revenue generated by licensed products shipped by the licensee 
the two companies with amended agreements are currently paying a fixed amount per quarter until there is further resolution on litigation 
intel 
royalties for the intel license are a fixed amount per quarter for five years  beginning on the date the contract was signed in september at the end of the five year period  if intel has paid in full  intel will have a fully paid up license to the complete rambus patent portfolio as it exists at that time 
contract revenues contract revenues represented approximately of our total revenues in fiscal  in  and in only licenses for rdram  raser and  in the future  yellowstone  generate contract revenues 
contract fees from rdram and raser agreements are comprised of license fees and engineering service fees 
our rdram and raser agreements generally require a licensee to pay a contract fee typically ranging from a few hundred thousand dollars for a narrow license covering a single logic product to millions of dollars for a license with broad coverage of rambus interfaces 
part of these fees may be due upon the achievement of certain milestones  such as the provision of certain deliverables by us or production of chips by the licensee 
all contract fees that are recognized as revenue are nonrefundable 
substantially all of the license fees and engineering service fees from rdram  yellowstone and raser agreements  are bundled together as contract fees because we generally do not provide or price these components separately 
these contracts also generally include rights to upgrades and enhancements 
accordingly  we recognize contract revenues ratably over the period during which post contract customer support is expected to be provided 
the excess of contract fees received over revenue recognized is shown on our balance sheet as deferred revenue 
revenue concentration because all of our revenues are derived from a relatively small number of licensees  our revenues tend to be highly concentrated 
in fiscal  revenues from our top three licensees  intel  toshiba and samsung  each accounted for greater than of our total revenues 
in fiscal  revenues from our top five licensees  hitachi  intel  nec  samsung and toshiba  each accounted for greater than of our total revenues 
in fiscal  revenues from our top three licensees  nec  samsung and toshiba  each accounted for greater than of our total revenues 
we expect that we will continue to experience significant revenue concentration for the foreseeable future 
however  the particular licensees which account for revenue concentration may vary from period to period depending on the addition of new contracts  industry consolidation  the expiration of deferred revenue schedules under existing contracts  and the volumes and prices at which the licensees sell licensed semiconductors to systems companies in any given period 
international revenues in fiscal   and  international revenues constituted  and of our total revenues  respectively 
we expect that revenues derived from international licensees will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in the future 
all of the revenues from international licensees to date have been denominated in united states dollars 
for additional information concerning international revenues  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements on page expenses we intend to continue making significant expenditures associated with engineering  marketing  general and administration  and expect that these costs and expenses will continue to be a significant percentage of revenues in future periods 
whether such expenses increase or decrease as a percentage of revenues will be substantially dependent upon the rate at which our revenues change 
engineering 
engineering costs are allocated between cost of contract revenues and research and development expenses 
cost of contract revenues is determined based on the portion of engineering costs which have been incurred during the period for the adaptation of our chip to chip interface interfaces for specific licensee processes 
the balance of engineering costs  incurred for general development of our interfaces  is charged to research and development 
in a given period  the allocation of engineering costs between these two components is a function of the timing of development and implementation cycles 
as a generation of technology matures from the development stage through implementation  the majority of engineering costs shift from research and development expenses to cost of contract revenues 
engineering costs are recognized as incurred and do not correspond to the recognition of revenues under the related contracts 
marketing  general and administrative 
marketing  general and administrative expenses include expenses and costs associated with trade shows  public relations  advertising  legal  finance  insurance and other marketing and administrative efforts 
costs of technical support for systems companies  including applications engineering  are also charged to marketing  general and administrative expense 
consistent with our business model  sales and marketing activities are focused on developing relationships with potential licensees and on participating with existing licensees in marketing  sales and technical efforts directed to systems companies 
in many cases  we must dedicate substantial resources to the marketing and support of systems companies 
due to the long business development cycles we face and the semi fixed nature of administrative expenses  marketing  general and administrative expenses in a given period generally are unrelated to the level of revenues in that period or in recent or future periods 
taxes 
we report certain items of income and expense for financial reporting purposes in different years than they are reported for tax purposes 
specifically  we report contract fees and royalties when received for tax purposes  as required by tax law 
for financial reporting purposes  however  we record revenues from rdram and raser contract fees over the period post contract customer support is expected to be provided and records revenues from sdram compatible and ddr compatible license fees over the five year contract period and records royalty revenues upon notification from licensees 
thus  we recognize revenue earlier for tax than for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  our net operating profit or loss for tax purposes may be more or less than the amount recorded for financial reporting purposes 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of operations revenues contract revenues royalties total revenues costs and expenses cost of contract revenues research and development marketing  general and administrative employee stock related compensation expense total costs and expenses operating income loss interest and other income  net income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss revenues 
revenues were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
contract revenues 
contract revenues decreased to million in fiscal the decrease in contract revenues in fiscal is due largely to the expiration of revenue recognition periods for several rdram contracts 
contract revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in contract revenues in fiscal is due largely to the expiration of revenue recognition periods for several rdram contracts 
this decrease was partially offset by the recognition of million of remaining deferred revenue on contracts for which all remaining obligations were terminated by mutual consent of rambus and our licensees 
such terminations result in the cancellation of all rdram development obligations by both parties 
since all license and engineering payments already received are non refundable  the balance of deferred revenue on these contracts was recognized in the period of cancellation 
the first contract revenue for raser interfaces was recognized in fiscal we anticipate continuing to book additional contracts  especially contracts with existing licensees for newer versions of our interfaces 
however  we anticipate that contract revenues will fluctuate over time as the value of contracts for which the revenue recognition periods have expired differs from the value of new contracts 
royalty revenues 
in fiscal  royalties decreased to million  or of total revenues  including a decline in royalties for sdram and ddr compatible products 
the decline in royalties for sdram and ddr compatible products was partially offset by increased licensees shipments of rdram memory devices and memory controllers that connect to rdram memory devices  primarily due to the success of the sony playstation in addition  royalties in fiscal reflect the first full year of royalties received under the intel cross license agreement which was signed in september in the second fiscal quarter of fiscal  due to the adverse litigation results in  we agreed to an amended fixed royalty agreement with a small licensee for sdram and ddr compatible products 
this is the second such agreement which calls for fixed quarterly royalty payments for these products 
the first agreement was with a large licensee in fiscal year in both cases  we believe the long term impact of the agreement remains unchanged since  with a favorable litigation outcome  the royalty payments return to the original agreement level 
in fiscal  royalties increased to million  or of total revenues from million  or of total revenues  in fiscal revenue increased dramatically in fiscal due to increased royalties on sdram and ddr compatible products as well as rdram memory devices and controllers 
the increase in sdram and ddr compatible products was driven by new licensees while the increase in rdram royalties was driven by the increased volumes of sony playstation and intel pentium products that interfaced with rdram 
we anticipate that our potential to generate royalties in fiscal will be largely dependent upon intel and system sales by pc manufacturers and sony 
none of the systems companies currently incorporating our technology into their products is contractually obligated to continue doing so 
given the concentration of royalties from a limited number of sources  it is likely that royalties will continue to vary greatly from period to period 
we expect that first royalties for the raser interface will be recognized in fiscal we do not expect royalties for yellowstone in fiscal engineering costs 
engineering costs  consisting of cost of contract revenues and research and development expenses  were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  which represented  and of revenues in the same periods  respectively 
the increase in engineering costs in fiscal was a result of increased compensation costs related to salary increases and the hiring of additional engineering personnel 
the increase in engineering costs in fiscal was primarily attributable to higher operating costs of the new office facilities to which we relocated at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal  as well as to the addition of engineering personnel to support continued improvements to our interfaces 
cost of contract revenues 
cost of contract revenues were million  million and million  which represented  and of revenues  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in the cost of contract revenues in fiscal and fiscal in absolute dollars  as a percentage of total revenues  and as a percentage of total engineering costs  is primarily due to the successful launch and ramp of rdram semiconductors into the pc main memory market resulting in a reduction in engineering support efforts  as well as to the effect of increased royalty revenues 
we believe that the level of cost of contract revenues will continue to fluctuate in the future  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues  as new rambus chip to chip interfaces go through the normal development and implementation phases 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million and million  which represented  and of revenues  in fiscal  and  respectively 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal year  and in fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development expenses increased as a percentage of revenues in fiscal as investment increased in the raser and yellowstone interfaces while revenue declined 
in fiscal  research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue due to the increase in our revenues 
we expect research and development expenses to increase over time as we enhance and improve our interfaces and apply them to new generations of semiconductors 
the rate of increase of  and the percentage of revenues represented by  research and development expenses in the future will vary from period to period based on the research and development projects underway and the change in engineering headcount in any given period  as well as the rate of change in our total revenues 
marketing  general and administrative 
marketing  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million  which represented  and of revenues  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal in marketing  general and administrative expenses primarily represents decreased litigation costs associated with the defense of our intellectual property 
litigation costs were million in fiscal versus million in fiscal year litigation expenses were down in fiscal primarily due to the high spending in fiscal trial delays in several of the pending cases as well as the number of simultaneous litigation activities contributed to the significant litigation expenses in fiscal in addition  at the beginning of fiscal  we began to incur higher rent and other ongoing operating costs associated with relocating our corporate headquarters to a larger facility to accommodate anticipated long term growth 
we expect marketing  general and administrative expenses to vary in the future 
litigation expenses are expected to vary from period to period  given the volatility of litigation activities 
we expect such costs will increase in fiscal relative to fiscal as we defend ourselves in the ftc action and as we continue to focus our resources on protecting our intellectual property rights 
the rate of increase of  and the percentage of revenues represented by  marketing  general and administrative expenses in the future will vary from period to period based on the trade shows  advertising  legal and other marketing and administrative activities undertaken and the change in sales  marketing and administrative headcount in any given period  as well as the rate of change in our total revenues 
employee stock related compensation expense 
as discussed below in the section entitled contingent warrants  common stock equivalents  and options  a million employee stock related compensation charge was taken in fiscal related to common stock equivalents granted to our chief executive officer and president and options granted to our employees 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net consists primarily of interest income from our cash investments 
interest and other income  net was million  million and million  which represented  and of revenues  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal was due to lower interest rates and reduced rental income from the sublease of our former office facilities in mountain view  california 
during fiscal  we sold one investment for a million gain and increased the valuation allowance related to investments by million to more closely reflect our estimate of current market values of the remaining securities 
the increase in absolute dollars in fiscal was due primarily to higher invested balances 
in addition  beginning in the second fiscal quarter of  interest and other income  net  includes net income recognized from the sublease of our former office facilities in mountain view  california 
we expect cash investments to remain flat  and  with current interest rates  interest and other income  net  will likely fluctuate in future periods due to the liquidation of investments and reinvestment at lower interest rates 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of million in fiscal  an income tax provision of million in fiscal  and an income tax benefit of million in fiscal the tax rate for fiscal and was and  respectively 
in fiscal  we determined  based upon our continued and growing profitability  that we would more likely than not be able to utilize our deferred tax assets  and recorded a million credit to income tax expense to reduce the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
for fiscal  the estimated federal and state combined rate on income before income taxes was 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate due to differences related to the timing of recognition of contract and royalty revenues and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes 
at september   we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million  primarily relating to the difference between tax and book treatment of employee stock related compensation expenses and deferred revenue  and net operating losses 
the deferred tax assets of approximately million  net of the valuation allowance of million  as of september   represents management s estimate of those tax assets which it believes will more likely than not a probability of just over fifty percent be realized 
the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is subject to periodic adjustment as facts and circumstances warrant 
the ability to realize the deferred tax asset is dependant on profitability staying at approximately current levels 
contingent warrants  common stock equivalents  and options in november  rambus entered into an agreement with intel corporation for the development of a new version of rdram interface 
in january  as part of this agreement  rambus issued a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock of rambus at a purchase price of per share the intel warrant 
this warrant was to have become exercisable only upon the achievement of certain milestones by intel relating to shipment volumes of rdram chipsets the intel milestones 
in september  this warrant was cancelled as part of contract negotiations that resulted in a new royalty bearing contract with intel 
in october  our board of directors authorized an incentive program in the form of warrants for a total of up to  shares of rambus common stock the dram incentive warrants to be issued to various rdram licensees upon the achievement of certain product qualification and volume production targets 
the warrants  to be issued at the time the targets are met  have an exercise price of per share and a life of five years 
these warrants vest and become exercisable on the same basis as the former intel warrant  which could result in a non cash charge to the statement of operations based on the fair value of the warrants at the time the achievement of the intel milestones becomes probable 
as of september   a total of  of these warrants had been issued 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we granted our chief executive officer and our president a combined total of  common stock equivalents cses and to our employees approximately  options to purchase our common stock at per share 
an additional  of these options were granted to employees in fiscal year vesting of these cses and options was contingent upon the achievement of key indicators of our success 
vesting for a portion of the cses and options granted in fiscal was contingent on an increase in the price of our common stock to greater than per share for consecutive days 
this target was achieved by the end of the second quarter of fiscal  and resulted in a million employee stock related compensation charge taken in the same quarter 
except for a million employer payroll tax liability  this was a non cash charge 
the remaining cses and options vest on the same basis as the former intel and existing dram incentive warrants  which could result in another almost entirely non cash charge to the statement of operations based on the fair value of the cses and options at the time achievement of the intel milestones becomes probable 
the magnitude of these charges is a function of the then current price of our common stock at the time the charges are taken 
for example  if these warrants  cses  and options were valued based upon a stock price of  the charge could be million or more 
the charge  when and if taken  will be non cash except for payroll tax liabilities  which would likely be more than offset by cash received by rambus upon exercise of the warrants and options 
share repurchase program in october  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program of our common stock principally to reduce the dilutive effect of employee stock options 
under the share repurchase program  we are authorized to purchase in open market transactions up to five million of our shares of outstanding common stock over an undefined period of time 
we repurchased million shares at a cost of million in fiscal year in october  our board of directors approved the purchase in open market transactions of up to an additional five million of our shares of outstanding common stock 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  including restricted investments of million and a long term component of million 
as of the same date  we had total working capital of million  including a short term component of deferred revenue of million 
deferred revenue represents the excess of cash received from licensees over revenue recognized on license contracts  and the short term component represents the amount of this deferred revenue expected to be recognized over the next twelve months 
without the short term component of deferred revenue  working capital would have been million at september  our operating activities provided net cash of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash generated in fiscal operations was primarily the result of net income  a decrease in prepaids  deferred taxes and other assets and accounts receivable  and an increase in accounts and taxes payable  accrued payroll and other liabilities 
this was partially offset by a decrease in deferred revenue 
cash generated by fiscal operations was primarily the result of net income and a decrease in prepaids  deferred taxes and other  offset by the tax cost of stock option exercises  increases in accounts receivable  and decreases in accounts and taxes payable  accrued payroll and other liabilities and deferred revenue 
cash generated by fiscal operations was primarily the result of net loss  the tax benefit of stock option exercises and deferred taxes  offset by non cash items  primarily non cash stock compensation expense 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
net cash provided in investing activities was million in fiscal investing activities have consisted primarily of net purchases and maturities of marketable securities  purchases and sales of investments  changes in restricted investments and purchases of property and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million in each of fiscal and in fiscal  we invested million in common stock repurchases which were offset by proceeds from the sale of common stock under the employee stock purchase and option plans  which totaled million 
in fiscal and  proceeds from the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase and option plans were the primary source of net cash provided by financing activities 
we presently anticipate that existing cash balances will be adequate to meet its cash needs for at least the next months 
lease commitments we relocated our headquarters at the beginning of calendar year  and entered into an agreement to sublease our previous mountain view facilities through the end of the existing lease term in february in the second quarter of fiscal  we agreed to accept reduced rent payments from our subtenant in exchange for an increase in the letter of credit that serves as collateral for certain of the subtenant s obligations under the lease 
we lease our present office facilities in los altos  california  under an operating lease agreement 
as part of this lease transaction  we provided the lessor with a letter of credit restricting million of our cash as collateral for certain of our obligations under the lease 
the cash is restricted as to withdrawal and is managed by a third party subject to certain limitations under our investment policy 
the letter of credit was reduced to million on the first anniversary of rent commencement and will be reduced to  on the second anniversary of rent commencement 
as of september   aggregate future minimum payments under the leases are in thousands leases subleases net commitments fiscal year thereafter total minimum lease payments critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to investments  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition as discussed previously  we generate contract and royalty revenues from the following four types of agreements rdram licenses  sdram and ddr compatible licenses  raser licenses and the intel cross license 
rdram licenses 
rdram licenses allow a semiconductor manufacturer to use our rdram memory interface and to receive engineering implementation services  customer support  and enhancements 
we deliver to a new rdram licensee an implementation package  which contains the information needed to develop a chip incorporating rdram memory interface in the licensee s process 
an implementation package includes a specification  a generalized circuit layout database software for the particular version of the chip which the licensee intends to develop  test parameter software and  for memory chips  a core interface specification 
test parameters are the programs that test the rdram interface embedded in the customer s product 
many licensees have contracted to have us provide the specific engineering implementation services required to optimize the generalized circuit layout for the licensee s manufacturing process 
the rdram licenses also provide for the right to receive ongoing customer support  which includes technical advice on chip specifications  enhancements  debugging and testing 
we recognize revenue on rdram licenses consistent with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position no 
sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition 
this sop applies to all entities that earn revenue on products containing software  where software is not incidental to the product as a whole 
contract fees for the services provided under these agreements are comprised of license fees  engineering service fees and nonrefundable  prepaid royalties 
contract fees are bundled together as the total price of the agreement does not vary as a result of inclusion or exclusion of services 
accordingly  the revenues from such contract fees are recognized ratably over the period during which the post contract customer support is expected to be provided independent of the payment schedules under the contract  including milestones 
we review assumptions regarding the post contract customer support periods on a regular basis 
if we determine that it is necessary to revise our estimates of the support periods  the total amount of revenue recognized over the life of the contract would not be affected 
however  to the extent the new assumptions regarding the post contract customer support periods were less than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized ratably over an accelerated period 
conversely  if the new estimated periods were longer than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized ratably over a longer period 
at the time we begin to recognize revenue under rdram licenses  the remaining obligations  as defined by the sop  are no longer significant 
these remaining obligations are primarily to keep the product updated and include activities such as responding to inquiries and periodic customer meetings 
part of these contract fees may be due upon the achievement of certain milestones  such as provision of certain deliverables by us or production of chips by the licensee 
the remaining fees are due on pre determined dates and include significant up front fees 
the excess of contract fees received over revenue recognized is shown on the balance sheet as deferred revenue 
sdram compatible and ddr compatible licenses 
sdram compatible and ddr compatible licenses also generally provide for the payment of fees which include compensation for use of our patents from the time we notify the licensee of potential infringement 
accordingly  we classify these fees as royalty revenues  which are recognized ratably over the five year contract period 
raser licenses 
raser interface licenses generally also provide for the payment of license fees and engineering fees  as well as royalties based upon the number of links produced by the licensees 
revenues from license fees and engineering fees are recognized ratably over the period during which the post contract customer support is expected to be provided  independent of the payment schedules under the contract 
royalties 
we recognize royalties upon notification of sale by our licensees 
the terms of the royalty agreements generally require licensees to give us notification and to pay us royalties within days of the end of the quarter during which the sales take place 
intel license 
we recognize royalties from the intel contract which grants intel access to the rambus patent portfolio as the amounts are due and payable pursuant to the contract with intel 
litigation as of september   we are involved in certain legal proceedings  as discussed in item legal proceedings  above  and in note of our consolidated financial statements 
based upon consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and an analysis of potential results  we have not accrued any amounts for potential losses related to these proceedings 
because of uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation 
we will record accruals for losses if and when we determine the negative outcome of such matters to be probable and reasonably estimable 
our estimates regarding such losses could differ from actual results 
revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
marketable securities we classify all of our marketable securities as available for sale 
we carry these investments at fair value  based on quoted market prices  and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses are recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists  it is our policy to record a valuation allowance to reduce aggregate investments to fair value and record the related charge as a reduction of interest income 
income taxes as part of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
this assessment is based on predictions of future taxable income that could vary materially from our assumptions 
for the purposes of making this assessment  we have assumed that future taxable income will be at or above current taxable income levels 
taxable income is impacted in future periods by income before taxes and stock option exercises 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely or uncertain  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment  based upon the advice of outside tax advisors  is required to determine our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
as of september   we have recorded a valuation allowance of million due to uncertainties related to our ability to recover some of our deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is based upon our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
as of september   we had net deferred tax assets of million

sfas will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit issuers and  by policy  attempt to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our policy  we will ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk 
we have no investments denominated in foreign country currencies and therefore are not subject to foreign exchange risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity
