item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
forward looking statements the following discussion contains forward looking statements based on current expectations  and we assume no obligation to update these statements 
because actual results may differ materially from expectations  we caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements 
these statements are based on our estimates  projections  beliefs  and assumptions  and are not guarantees of future performance 
a number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from historical results  or from results or outcomes currently expected or sought by us 
these factors include a reduced demand for internet services  the loss of one or more of our significant clients  an inability to increase our market share  difficulties in maintaining our technology alliances  and a continued downturn in economic conditions 
these factors and the other matters discussed below under the heading factors that may affect future results and our stock price may cause future results to differ materially from historical results  or from results or outcomes we currently expect or seek 
overview since the third quarter of  the market for information technology it services has changed dramatically and the demand has declined significantly 
as part of our effort to adjust our structure to better address a rapidly changing and declining it services market  we have closed underperforming or vacant regional offices  reduced staff in remaining offices  recorded material charges related to underutilized data center facility computer equipment and leasehold improvements and developed and began implementing an aggressive growth strategy through acquiring like minded peer consultancies 
we closed four such transactions in  a fifth such transaction during january and anticipate additional  similar transactions during the remainder of we have operated at a loss for each of the last four years 
the losses  combined with the market for it services  raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we are reducing our operating expenses in order to improve cash flow from operations 
management believes that cash receipts may be accelerated through accounts receivable backed financing to support growth opportunities  support working capital needs and address unanticipated contingencies 
additional needed financing may not be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to raise additional capital and significantly reduce operating losses  our business activities may be significantly curtailed 
we derive our revenues primarily from the delivery of professional services 
we offer our services to clients under time and materials contracts or under fixed fee contracts 
for time and material projects  we recognize revenues based on the number of hours worked by consultants at a rate per hour agreed upon with our clients 
we recognize revenues from fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion method based on project hours worked 
the percentage of our revenues from fixed fee contracts was approximately in  in and in we provide our application outsourcing services for a minimum monthly fee and charge extra fees for services that exceed agreed upon parameters 
revenues from these services are recognized as services are provided 
revenues for services rendered are not recognized until collectibility is reasonably assured 
our cost of revenues consists primarily of employee compensation and benefits and depreciation of hosting facility property and equipment 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits  and the costs of marketing programs 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits for our executive management and our finance  administration  information technology  and human resources personnel 
general and administrative expenses also include research and development expense  depreciation  bad debt expense and operating expenses such as rent  insurance  telephones  office supplies  travel  outside professional services  training  and facilities costs 
we have historically derived and believe that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of clients who may change from year to year 
any cancellation  deferral  or significant reduction in work performed for our principal clients could harm our business and cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
as a result of our investments in infrastructure and increase in operating expenses  we incurred a net loss in each of the last four years 
our quarterly revenue  cost of revenues  and operating results have varied in the past due to fluctuations in the utilization of project personnel and are likely to vary significantly in the future 
therefore  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
recent acquisitions as part of our effort to adjust our structure to better address a rapidly changing and declining it services market  we developed and began implementing an aggressive growth strategy through acquiring like minded peer consultancies 
the acquisition target companies ideally have leading competitive positions in regional and vertical markets  a proven track record of providing microsoft based solutions  a booked backlog of project work for premier clients  managers in place who are capable of leading a regional division for the company  a working culture and ethic similar to our own and are owned by consultants who remain active in the business 
we closed four such transactions in  a fifth such transaction during january and anticipate additional  similar transactions throughout on august   we completed a series of transactions with k digital  inc k  a publicly held digital services firm based in new york city 
in that transaction  we hired management and consulting employees of k  acquired certain related fixed assets and assumed certain of the leased office space of k in new york city 
the transactions were paid for with cash and the assumption of certain operating expenses of k on september   we completed a similar series of transactions with step technology  inc step  a portland  oregon based information technology consulting firm 
in that transaction  we hired management and consulting personnel of step  acquired certain related assets and assumed a portion of step s office space in portland 
the transaction was paid for with cash and the assumption of certain operating expenses of step 
on october   we completed a similar series of transactions with inteflux  inc inteflux  a phoenix  arizona based information technology consultancy with international operations in london  england 
in that transaction  we hired management and consulting personnel of inteflux  acquired certain related assets and assumed the leased office space of inteflux in phoenix and london 
the transaction was paid for with a combination of cash and restricted shares of our common stock  as well as the assumption of certain operating expenses of inteflux 
on november   we completed a similar series of transactions with winfield allen  inc winfield allen  a denver  colorado based information technology consultancy 
in that transaction  we hired management and consulting personnel of winfield allen  acquired certain related assets  and assumed the leased office space of winfield allen 
the transaction was paid for with a combination of cash  a promissory note and restricted shares of our common stock  as well as the assumption of certain expenses of winfield allen 
in a subsequent event  on january   we completed a series of transactions to hire the executive management and key professional staff and acquire certain related assets of goliath networks  inc goliath  a madison  wisconsin based information consulting and services firm 
in that transaction  we hired management and consulting personnel of goliath  acquired certain related assets  and assumed the leased office space of goliath in madison and milwaukee  wisconsin 
the transaction was paid for with a combination of cash and assumption of a promissory note 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to long term service contracts  bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company recognizes revenue and profit as work progresses on long term  fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
the company follows this method because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company recorded goodwill and other intangible assets from acquisitions during the company reviews the acquired businesses on a periodic basis to determine that projected cash flows are deemed adequate to support the value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in the current carrying value of the intangible assets  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
the company records accruals for the estimated future cash expenditures required from closing its vacated offices 
the accruals include estimates of future rent payments and settlements until the obligation is canceled 
should actual cash expenditures differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated liability for closing vacated offices would be required 
the company evaluates the requirement for future cash expenditures resulting from its contingencies and litigation 
the company records an accrual for contingencies and litigation when exposures can be reasonably estimated and are considered probable 
should the actual results differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated liability for contingencies and litigation would be required

loss before income tax benefit income tax benefit net loss liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations and investments in property and equipment through cash generated from operations  capital lease financing arrangements  bank borrowings  and equity financings 
in january  we raised million  before expenses of  through a private placement of series c preferred stock to institutional and other accredited investors 
in march and april  we raised an additional million net of underwriting discounts and other offering expenses through our initial public offering of  shares of our common stock 
at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million in working capital  as compared to million and million at december  net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
cash used in operating activities in each of these periods was the result of net losses  adjusted for non cash items related to depreciation  amortization and asset impairment  and fluctuations in receivables  unbilled and deferred revenues on contracts  prepaid expenses and other current assets  and accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
cash used in investing activities in each period consisted primarily of purchases of computer equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements 
during we invested in acquisitions of assets of other companies totaling million 
during we invested approximately million  net of leased furniture and equipment  in our application outsourcing services data center 
we also invested in geographical expansion during for  net cash used in financing activities was million  compared to net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for approximately million 
our net repayments of capital lease obligations totaled approximately million for the same period 
we also allocated million to restricted cash of which million was used during non cash investing and financing activities for the years ended december    and consisted of new capital lease obligations for property and equipment of million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  as a result of our acquisitions during  we assumed capital lease obligations totaling million and issued common stock totaling million 
as of december   we had a master lease agreement to finance up to million of computer equipment with comerica leasing corporation  as sucessor to imperial bank 
the master lease agreement has an implied interest rate of approximately 
as of december   approximately million was outstanding under this master lease agreement 
the master lease agreement expires on various dates through june in june  the company deposited million into a restricted certificate of deposit account 
the funds in this account serve as collateral against various letters of credit totaling million 
during  million of the funds were drawn down to pay current and future lease obligations 
a summary of our contractual cash obligations at december  follows amounts in thousands capital lease obligations  including interest operating leases total contractual cash obligations thereafter the company operates in a highly competitive market 
the information technology services industry has experienced rapid growth followed by rapid and significant contraction over a relatively short economic cycle 
the company s rapid growth phase required significant investments in infrastructure  facilities  computer and office equipment  human resources and working capital in order to meet perceived demand 
since the third quarter of  the market for our services has changed and declined significantly 
we incurred negative cash flows from operations for each of the three years ended december  these factors  among other things  raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
management is pursuing various options in order to provide necessary financing 
management s plans to resolve near term cash flow issues include the following restructuring the terms and payments of facility and equipment leases  negotiating a new line of credit through accounts receivable backed financing  a private placement of equity financing  and projected improvement of operating results 
the projected improvement of operating results includes closing unprofitable offices that could not become profitable in the near term  reducing staff in remaining offices and recording expenses and charges associated with impairments on assets and idle facilities 
management continues to reduce operating expenses and believes that the actions taken will improve cash flow from operations 
management believes if it can finalize the financing alternatives that it is pursuing  together with its projected improvement in operating results for  the company will generate sufficient resources to ensure uninterrupted performance of its operating obligations 
the company s continuance as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations in a timely manner  to obtain additional financing as required and ultimately to attain profitability 
there can be no assurance  however  that these sources will be available to the company on acceptable terms or when necessary  or that the company will be successful in its efforts to improve its operating results 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 business combinations sfas  and statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas became effective for us as of july  it establishes new standards for accounting and reporting requirements for business combinations and requires the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas became effective for us on january  and requires  among other things  the cessation of the amortization of goodwill 
in addition  the standard includes provisions for the reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  a new method of measuring reported goodwill for impairment and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
sfas also requires us to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test on or before june  we have recorded million of goodwill relating to the four acquisitions completed after the effective date of sfas  and there has been no amortization expense recorded in the accompanying financial statements 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact of the provisions of sfas  including any impairment resulting from the transition tests 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and for the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas requires an enterprise to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the assets 
the enterprise also is to record a corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the related long lived assets and to depreciate that cost over the life of the asset 
the liability is changed at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time ie  accretion expense and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the initial fair value measurement 
we are required to adopt sfas in  and we believe its adoption will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas that addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  including discontinued operations 
while sfas supercedes statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that statement 
sfas also supersedes certain provisions of abp opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
the provisions of sfas will be effective for us in and are to be applied prospectively 
we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
factors that may affect future results and our stock price this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities act of forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events 
words such as expect  may  anticipate  intend  would  will  plan  believe  estimate  should  and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements in this form k include express or implied statements concerning our future revenues  expenditures  capital or other funding requirements  the adequacy of our current cash and working capital balances to fund our present and planned operations and financing needs  expansion of and demand for our service offerings  and the growth of our business and operations  as well as future economic and other conditions both generally and in our specific geographic and product and services markets 
these statements are based on our estimates  projections  beliefs  and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance 
from time to time  we also may provide oral or written forward looking statements in other materials we release to the public 
we caution that the following important factors  among others  could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by or on behalf of us in filings with the securities and exchange commission  press releases  communications with investors  and oral statements 
any of these factors  among others  could also negatively impact our operating results and financial condition and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline or fluctuate significantly 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
you are advised  however  to consult any further disclosures we make in our reports filed with the securities and exchange commission and in future public statements and press releases 
we have experienced operating losses and may incur operating losses in future periods  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further 
we had a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december   a net loss of million for the year ended december  and a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  we expect to continue to incur losses in if we do not achieve revenue growth  we could experience operating losses greater than already anticipated or for periods after these losses or any fluctuation in our operating results could cause the market value of our common stock to decline further 
if we are unable to maintain a nasdaq national market listing or transfer to nasdaq smallcap market listing  our common stock may become even more illiquid and the value of our securities may decline further 
we received a letter  dated february   from the nasdaq stock market  inc  notifying us of our failure to meet nasdaq s minimum market value of publicly held shares and minimum bid price requirements 
if we do not comply with nasdaq s listing requirements by may   our common stock will be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
we may apply for transfer of our common stock listing to the nasdaq smallcap market 
to transfer  we would need to satisfy the continued listing requirements for the nasdaq smallcap market  which makes available an extended grace period for the minimum per share bid price requirement 
at the present time  we do not meet these continued listing requirements 
if we submit a transfer application and pay the applicable listing fees to nasdaq by may   initiation of delisting proceedings will be stayed pending nasdaq s review of our transfer application 
if the transfer application is approved  we will be probably be afforded a calendar day grace period within which we must meet the nasdaq smallcap market s continued listing requirements  including the per share bid price requirement 
this grace period would end on august  we may also be eligible for an additional calendar day grace period if we maintain net tangible assets in excess of million 
if we continue to fail to meet the nasdaq national market s listing requirements and our transfer application is not approved  nasdaq will delist our common stock 
if this occurs  our common stock will likely trade in the over the counter market in the so called pink sheets maintained by pink sheets llc or on the national association of securities dealers otc bulletin board 
such alternative trading markets are generally considered less liquid and efficient than nasdaq  and although trading in our stock is already relatively thin and sporadic  the liquidity of our common stock would probably decline further because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold  transactions could be delayed and securities analysts and news media coverage of iis would diminish 
these factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our common stock 
reduced liquidity may reduce the value of our common stock and our ability to generate additional funding 
we may need additional capital which  if not available to us  may alter our business plan or limit our ability to achieve growth in revenues and which  if available and raised  would dilute your ownership interest in us 
we incurred negative cash flows from operations in and continue to do so in although we believe that we have sufficient cash to fund existing operations for the balance of the year  we are pursuing sources of working capital 
we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings in order to address working capital needs if collection of accounts receivable declines  take advantage of acquisition or expansion opportunities  develop new services  or address unanticipated contingencies 
our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all  may limit our ability to increase revenues or to achieve profitability 
our stock price  like the stock price of many competitors in our industry  has been depressed in recent periods  which could limit our ability to obtain any needed financing on favorable or acceptable terms 
in addition  if we are able to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or through taking on debt with an equity component  your investment in us would be diluted  which could cause our stock price to further decline 
we anticipate acquiring more businesses  and we may incur increased operating expenses without corresponding increased revenues  which may limit our ability to achieve or maintain profitability and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
a key component of our business strategy is to acquire like minded peer consultancies in geographic areas where we do not have a strong presence 
we also look for acquisition opportunities  without focusing on increasing our geographic diversity  if there is an opportunity to strengthen a current service offering or add a service offering which complements our current service offerings 
in past years  we have tried to achieve profitability by increasing revenues delivered from regional offices 
many of the regional offices were not profitable  and we have closed five regional offices and consolidated others as a result 
our acquisitions often involve some of the same risks as opening offices in new markets 
if we are not more successful in integrating the operations of acquired businesses than we were with opening regional offices  we may not be able to operate profitably 
the risks of acquisitions include retaining clients  retaining key employees  incurring higher than anticipated transaction expenses and other unexpected expenses and diverting management s attention from daily operations of our business 
acquiring businesses  especially in markets in which we have limited prior experience  is risky 
if we do not implement this strategy successfully  we may incur increased operating expenses without increased revenues  which could materially harm our operating results and stock price 
we rely on a small number of clients for most of our revenues and our revenues will decline significantly if we cannot retain or replace  or if we experience collection problems from  these clients 
we derive  and expect to continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of clients 
two customers  american express and ncs pearson  accounted for and  respectively  of our revenue during  and two customers  american express and partsamerica 
com  inc  accounted for and  respectively  of our revenue during virtually all of our client contracts may be canceled by the client after a short notice period and without economic penalty 
clients remain responsible to us for fees we earn through the date of contract termination unless a valid offset exists 
revenues from specific clients are likely to vary from period to period 
a major client in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year 
our two largest clients in were not our largest clients in the fourth quarter of  and each will likely represent a smaller percentage of our revenues 
revenue from american express will likely decline both overall and as a percentage of revenue as a result of its decision to outsource daily management of many of its it functions to another  larger vendor 
the loss of a large client or project in any period could result in a decline in our revenues and profitability from period to period and cause significant and sudden declines or fluctuations in the market value of our common stock 
in addition  because a large portion of our receivables relate to a limited number of clients and large projects  write offs attributable to one or a few of these clients or projects could exceed our allowance for doubtful accounts and significantly harm our operating results 
because the market for our services may not grow during  we may be unable to become profitable 
we offer services in the it services market  and that market contracted in we do not anticipate significant growth in the it services market in during  in anticipation of a continued increase in demand for consulting and application outsourcing services  we made substantial infrastructure investment to support the anticipated demand 
that demand did not materialize  and  during  we took a million charge for underutilized data center facility computer equipment and leasehold improvements and a million charge for the expenses we incurred in closing and consolidating six office locations 
if demand for our services does not grow in the future  or if we do not capture sufficient market share for these services  we may continue to be burdened with a larger than necessary infrastructure and may be unable to achieve profitability 
we may incur expenditures relating to closed office leases which are greater than what we have anticipated  which would require us to expend limited financial reserves and adversely impact our liquidity 
we have accrued approximately million for future cash expenditures relating to five closed regional offices and the consolidation of other offices 
the actual future expenditures related to these closed and consolidated offices may be greater than our accrual  and  in that event  the additional expenses will reduce earnings and cash in future periods 
any such reduction will adversely impact our liquidity  operating results and common stock price 
our results of operations may vary from quarter to quarter in future periods and  as a result  we may not meet the expectations of our investors and analysts  which could cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline 
our revenues and results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and could fluctuate significantly in the future 
we incurred net losses of million  million  million and million in the first  second  third  and fourth quarters of  respectively 
our results may fluctuate due to the factors described in this form k  as well as the loss of or failure to replace any significant clients  variation in demand for our services  higher than expected bad debt write offs  changes in the mix of services that we offer  and variation in our operating expenses 
a substantial portion of our operating expense is related to personnel costs and overhead  which cannot be adjusted quickly and is  therefore  relatively fixed in the short term 
our operating expenses are based  in significant part  on our expectations of future revenues 
if actual revenues are below our expectations  we may not achieve our anticipated operating results 
moreover  it is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of analysts and investors 
in this event  the market price of our common stock is likely to decline 
if we fail to keep pace with the rapid technological changes that characterize our industry  our competitiveness would suffer  causing us to lose projects or clients and consequently reducing our revenues and the price of our common stock 
our market and the enabling technologies used by our clients are characterized by rapid  frequent  and significant technological changes 
if we fail to respond in a timely or cost effective way to these technological developments  we may not be able to meet the demands of our clients  which would affect our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability 
we have derived  and expect to continue to derive  a large portion of our revenues from creating solutions that are based upon today s leading and developing technologies and which are capable of adapting to future technologies 
our historical results of operations may not reflect our new service offerings and may not give you an accurate indication of our ability to adapt to these future technologies 
our failure to meet client expectations or deliver error free services could damage our reputation and harm our ability to compete for new business or retain our existing clients  which may limit our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability 
many of our engagements involve the delivery of information technology services that are critical to our clients businesses 
any defects or errors in these services or failure to meet clients specifications or expectations could result in delayed or lost revenues due to adverse client reaction  requirements to provide additional services to a client at no or a limited charge  refunds of fees for failure to meet obligations  negative publicity about us and our services  and claims for substantial damages against us 
in addition  we sometimes implement critical functions for high profile clients or for projects that have high visibility and widespread usage in the marketplace 
if these functions experience difficulties  whether or not as a result of errors in our services  our name could be associated with these difficulties and our reputation could be damaged  which would harm our business 
we may lose money on fixed price contracts because we may fail to accurately estimate at the beginning of projects the time and resources required to fulfill our obligations under our contracts  the additional expenditures that we must make to fulfill these contract obligations may cause our profitability to decline or prevent us from achieving profitability and could reduce the price of our common stock 
although we provide consulting services primarily on a time and materials compensation basis  approximately of our consulting revenue was derived from fixed price  fixed time engagements in  and approximately of revenues were derived from fixed price  fixed time engagements in the percentage of our revenues derived from fixed price  fixed time engagements may increase in the future  as influenced by changes in demand and market conditions 
our failure to accurately estimate the resources required for a fixed price  fixed time engagement or our failure to complete our contractual obligations in a manner consistent with our projections or contractual commitments could harm our overall profitability and our business 
from time to time  we have been required to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete some fixed price  fixed time engagements  resulting in losses on these engagements 
we believe that we may experience similar situations in the future 
in addition  we may negotiate a fixed price for some projects before the design specifications are finalized  resulting in a fixed price that is too low and causing a decline in our operating results 
our lack of long term contracts with clients and our clients ability to terminate contracts with little or no notice reduces the predictability of our revenues and increases the potential volatility of our stock price 
our clients generally retain us on an engagement by engagement basis  rather than under long term contracts 
in addition  our current clients can generally reduce the scope of or cancel their use of our services without penalty and with little or no notice 
as a result  our revenues are difficult to predict 
because we incur costs based on our expectations of future revenues  our failure to predict our revenues accurately may cause our expenses to exceed our revenues  which could cause us to incur increased operating losses 
although we try to design and build complete integrated information systems for our clients  we are sometimes retained to design and build discrete segments of the overall system on an engagement by engagement basis 
since the projects of our large clients can involve multiple engagements or stages  there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project or that the client will cancel or delay additional planned projects 
these cancellations or delays could result from factors related or unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project  including changing client objectives or strategies  as well as general business or financial considerations of the client 
if a client defers  modifies  or cancels an engagement or chooses not to retain us for additional phases of a project  we may not be able to rapidly re deploy our employees to other engagements and may suffer underutilization of employees and the resulting harm to our operating results 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed and cannot be reduced on short notice to compensate for unanticipated variations in the number or size of engagements in progress 
the slowing in spending on business and it consulting initiatives that began in the second half of continues  and if current or potential clients cancel or delay their it initiatives  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we may not be successful in retaining our current technology alliances or entering into new alliances  which could hamper our ability to market or deliver solutions needed or desired by our clients and limit our ability to increase or sustain our revenues and achieve or maintain profitability 
we rely on vendor alliances for client referral and marketing opportunities  access to advanced technology and training as well as other important benefits 
these relationships are non exclusive and the vendors are free to enter into similar or more favorable relationships with our competitors 
whether written or oral  many of the agreements underlying our relationships are general in nature  do not legally bind the parties to transact business with each other or to provide specific client referrals  cross marketing opportunities  or other intended benefits to each other  have indefinite terms  and may be ended at the will of either party 
we may not be able to maintain our existing strategic relationships and may fail to enter into new relationships 
if we are unable to maintain these relationships  the benefits that we derive from these relationships  including the receipt of important sales leads  cross marketing opportunities  access to emerging technology training and certifications  and other benefits  may be lost 
consequently  we may not be able to offer desired solutions to clients  which would result in a loss of revenues and our inability to effectively compete for clients seeking emerging or leading technologies offered by these vendors 
because we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing industry  competitors could cause us to lose business opportunities and limit our ability to increase or sustain revenue levels 
although our industry experienced significant consolidation in  the business areas in which we compete remain intensely competitive and subject to rapid change 
we expect competition to continue and to intensify 
our competitors currently fall into several categories and include a range of entities providing both general management and information technology consulting services and internet services 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  larger client bases  and greater brand or name recognition  as well as greater financial  technical  marketing  and public relations resources 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to technological developments and changes in clients needs 
further  as a result of the low barriers to entry  we may face additional competition from new entrants into our markets 
we do not own any technologies that preclude or inhibit competitors from entering the general business areas in which we compete 
existing or future competitors may independently develop and patent or copyright technologies that are superior or substantially similar to our technologies  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage 
all of these factors could lead to competitors winning new client engagements that we compete for 
if this occurs  our ability to generate increased revenues may be limited and we may not achieve profitability 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights and  as a result  we could lose competitive advantages which differentiate our solutions and our ability to attract and retain clients 
our success is dependent  in part  upon our intellectual property rights 
we rely upon a combination of trade secret  confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements  and other contractual arrangements  as well as copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights 
we have no patents or pending patent applications 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  we generally require that our consultants and clients enter into these agreements  and we attempt to limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
nevertheless  we may be unable to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information or to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights or proprietary information 
we attempt to retain significant ownership or rights to use our internally developed software applications which we can market and adapt through further customization for other client projects 
under some of our client contracts  all of our project developments are the property of the client and we have no right or only limited rights to reuse or provide these developments in other client projects 
to the extent that we are unable to negotiate contracts which permit us to reuse code and methodologies  or to the extent that we have conflicts with our clients regarding our ability to do so  we may be unable to provide services to some of our clients within price and timeframes acceptable to these clients 
although we believe that our services  trade or service names  and products do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others  claims could be asserted against us in the future 
if asserted  we may be unable to successfully defend these claims  which could cause us to cease providing some services or products and limit any competitive advantage we derive from our trademarks or names 
if any of these events occur  our ability to differentiate ourselves and compete effectively could be limited and we may lose revenue opportunities 
we occasionally agree not to perform services for our clients competitors  which may limit our ability to generate future revenues and inhibit our business strategy 
in order to secure particularly large engagements or engagements with industry leading clients  we have agreed on limited occasions not to perform services  or not to utilize some of our intellectual property rights developed for clients  for competitors of those clients for limited periods of time ranging from one to three years 
in our agreement with american express  our largest client in and  we have agreed not to perform services for competitors of american express for one year after each project completion date and not to assign consultants who have worked on american express projects to other clients competitive projects for nine months after completing work for american express 
these non compete provisions reduce the number of our prospective clients and our potential sources of revenue 
these agreements also may limit our ability to execute a part of our business strategy of leveraging our business expertise in discreet industry segments by attracting multiple clients competing in those industries 
in addition  these agreements increase the significance of our client selection process because some of our clients compete in markets where only a limited number of companies gain meaningful market share 
if we agree not to perform services or to utilize intellectual property rights for a particular client s competitors or competitive projects  we are unlikely to receive significant future revenues in that particular market 
our long sales cycles make our revenues difficult to predict  which could cause our revenues or profitability to be below analyst or investor expectations  causing our stock price to fluctuate and decline significantly 
the timing of our revenues is difficult to predict because of the length and variance of the time required to complete a sale 
our sales cycle typically ranges in length from three months to nine months and is sometimes longer 
prior to retaining us for a project  our clients often undertake an extensive review of their systems  needs  and budgets and may require approval at various levels within their organization 
the length or unpredictability of our sales cycle could cause our revenues or profitability to be below the expectations of analysts or investors and our stock price to fluctuate significantly 
if we are unable to successfully position and sell our application outsourcing services  we may be unable to recover our investment in providing these services  reducing our profitability and the price of our common stock 
our ability to increase revenues and profitability depends in part on the adoption and acceptance of third party application hosting services by our clients 
during we were not successful in selling these services in volume  and we recorded a million charge for underutilized data center facility computer equipment and leasehold improvements 
if we do not generate sufficient revenues from these services  our operating results and stock price would continue to be negatively affected 
some of our clients have little or no operating history and may lack the resources to pay our fees  which could cause us to incur losses on these accounts 
we derive a portion of our revenues from companies with limited operating histories and limited resources to pay our fees 
we generally request retainers or deposits from clients who appear to have inadequate credit  but some of these clients may fail and may be unable to pay for our services in a timely manner  or at all 
this would reduce our cash flow  making it difficult to carry on our business without additional funds  and could lead to the inefficient allocation of our professional and other resources 
the loss of mr 
james g 
garvey  jr  our founder  chairman  president and chief executive officer  may harm our ability to obtain and retain client engagements  maintain a cohesive culture  or compete effectively 
our success will depend in large part upon the continued services of james g 
garvey  jr  our founder  chairman  president and chief executive officer 
we have an employment contract with mr 
garvey 
mr 
garvey is precluded under his agreement from competing against us for one year should he leave us 
the loss of mr 
garvey s services could harm us and cause a loss of investor confidence in our business  which could cause the trading price of our stock to decline 
in addition  if mr 
garvey resigns to join a competitor or to form a competing company  the loss of mr 
garvey and any resulting loss of existing or potential clients to any competitor could harm our business 
if we lose mr 
garvey  we may be unable to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use by other companies of our technical knowledge  practices  or procedures 
in addition  due to the substantial number of shares of our common stock owned by mr 
garvey  the loss of mr 
garvey s services could cause investor or analyst concern that mr 
garvey may sell a large portion of his shares  which could cause a rapid and substantial decline in the trading price of our common stock 
the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect their market price  negatively impacting your investment 
there are a substantial number of shares of our common stock potentially available for sale in the public market 
the sale of a substantial number of shares in the public market could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 
the holdings of mr 
garvey may limit your ability to influence the outcome of director elections and other matters subject to a stockholder vote  including a sale of our company on terms that may be attractive to you 
james g 
garvey  jr  our founder  chairman  president and chief executive officer  currently owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
mr 
garvey s stock ownership and management positions enable him to exert considerable influence over our company  including in the election of directors and the approval of other actions submitted to our stockholders 
in addition  without the consent of mr 
garvey  we may be prevented from entering into transactions that could be viewed as beneficial to other stockholders  including a sale of the company 
this could prevent you from selling your stock to a potential acquirer at prices that exceed the market price of our stock  or could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
our charter documents could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  which could limit your ability to sell your stock to an acquirer at a premium price or could cause our stock price to decline 
our certificate of incorporation and by laws may make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change in control would be beneficial to stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to  shares of blank check preferred stock 
without stockholder approval  the board of directors has the authority to attach special rights  including voting and dividend rights  to this preferred stock 
with these rights  preferred stockholders could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire our company 
our by laws do not permit any person other than at least three members of our board of directors  our president  the chairman of the board  or holders of at least a majority of our stock to call special meetings of the stockholders 
in addition  a stockholder s proposal for an annual meeting must be received within a specified period in order to be placed on the agenda 
because stockholders have limited power to call meetings and are subject to timing requirements in submitting stockholder proposals for consideration at meetings  any third party takeover or other matter that stockholders wish to vote on that is not supported by the board of directors could be subject to significant delays and difficulties 
if a third party finds it more difficult to acquire us because of these provisions  you may not be able to sell your stock at a premium price that may have been offered by the acquirer  and the trading price of our stock may be lower than it otherwise would be if these provisions were not in effect 
the valuation model for companies such as ours has changed  and our inability to achieve profitability may continue to materially adversely affect our stock price 
when our stock became publicly traded in  companies in our sector were valued generally upon revenue growth  with little regard for profitability 
companies in our sector are now generally measured on cash flows and profits 
if we are unable to achieve profitability and positive cash flow  our stock price will continue to suffer and could further decline  and the liquidity for our stock could deteriorate further as well 
our stock repurchase plan may adversely affect the trading volume and liquidity of our common stock and could cause our stock price to decline 
in december  our board authorized a stock repurchase plan which authorized us to purchase up to million of our common stock on the open market in compliance with applicable sec regulations 
in august  our board authorized an increase in the maximum amount from million to million 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately million 
we currently have no plan to repurchase additional shares of our common stock 
however  if we do repurchase more shares of our common stock under this plan  the number of shares of our common stock outstanding will decrease 
this decrease would likely reduce the trading volume of our common stock  adversely impacting the liquidity and value of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to date  we have not utilized derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
we do not expect to employ these or other strategies to hedge market risk in we invest our cash in money market funds  which are subject to minimal credit and market risk 
we believe that the market risks associated with these financial instruments are immaterial 
all of our revenues are realized currently in us dollars and are from customers primarily in the united states 
therefore  we do not believe that we currently have any significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk
