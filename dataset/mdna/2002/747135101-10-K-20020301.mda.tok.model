item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview pyramid breweries inc was incorporated in and is engaged in the brewing and sale of specialty beers and sodas and in restaurant operations 
the company currently sells its beverage products primarily in washington  oregon and california under the pyramid and thomas kemper brand names and operates two restaurants  under the pyramid alehouse name  each adjacent to its seattle  washington and berkeley  california breweries 
the company s revenues consist of sales of beer and soda to third party distributors and retail sales of beer  soda  food  apparel and other items in its restaurants 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and of the company s net sales were sales of beer and soda to third party distributors 
total retail alehouse sales accounted for and of total net sales in and  respectively 
the company s sales volumes and selling prices are affected by several factors such as level of consumer demand in existing markets  sales in new distribution areas  availability of beer distributors in new and existing markets  and competitive factors  including the increase or decrease in the number of competing craft beers  new product introductions and promotional pricing 
sales in the craft beer industry generally reflect a significant degree of seasonality with the second and third calendar quarters reflecting stronger sales than in the first and fourth calendar quarters 
the company s operating results are subject to quarterly fluctuations due to a variety of factors and the company anticipates that its operating margin will fluctuate as a result of many factors  including i lower sales volumes due to changes in demand and lower selling prices due to increased product availability  ii increased depreciation and other fixed and semi fixed operating costs as a percent of sales during periods when the company s breweries are producing below capacity  iii sales seasonality and competition  iv increased raw material or packaging costs  and v changes in the sales mix 
increased selling and promotional costs incurred as the company protects its business in existing markets and develops its business in new geographic areas may also cause operating margins and operating income to decrease

risk factors and forwarding looking statements the company does not provide forecasts of future financial performance 
however this report does contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  which are subject to the safe harbor created by that section 
there are numerous important factors that could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated by some of the statements made by the company 
investors are cautioned that all forward looking statements involve a high degree of risk and uncertainty 
increasing competition 
the domestic market in which the company s craft beers compete is highly competitive for many reasons  including the continuing proliferation of new beers and brew pubs  efforts by regional craft brewers to expand their distribution  the introduction of fuller flavored products by certain major 
table of contents national brewers  and underutilized craft brewing capacity 
the company anticipates that intensifying competition from craft beer and imported beer producers and excess capacity in the craft beer segment may adversely impact the company s operating margins 
in addition  the larger national brewers have developed brands to compete directly with craft beers 
these national competitors have advantages such as lower production costs  larger marketing budgets  greater financial and other resources and more developed and extensive distribution networks than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to grow its volumes or be able to maintain its selling prices in existing markets or as it enters new markets 
access to markets 
most of the company s independent distributors are also distributors of national brewers  some of whom have used their greater influence and marketing resources to persuade those distributors to exclude the products of other breweries from their portfolios 
such actions by national brewers have the effect of reducing distribution options for the company s products 
in addition  there is evidence that independent distributors are moving towards consolidation to improve profit margins 
although the company has not yet been negatively impacted by such events  it is possible that the company could effectively be denied access to a market or markets by the tactics of the national brewers and further consolidation of independent distributors 
in the states that comprise the majority of its sales  the company has the option to distribute its products directly to retailers and the company has previous experience in doing so 
however  there is no assurance that self distribution can be done in an economic manner over large territories 
government regulations 
the company s business is highly regulated at the federal  state and local levels  and its brewery and restaurant operations require various licenses  permits and approvals 
the loss or revocation of any existing licenses  permits or approvals or the failure to obtain any additional licenses  permits or approvals in new jurisdictions where the company intends to do business could have a material adverse effect on the ability of the company to conduct its business 
further  federal regulations prohibit  among other things  the payment of slotting allowances to retailers for beer products 
these regulations have the effect of preventing competitors with greater financial resources from excluding smaller brewers from retailers 
if these regulations were repealed or substantially modified  there would likely be a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
selling prices 
the future selling prices the company charges for its craft beer and other specialty beverages may decrease from historical levels due to increasing competitive pressures 
the company has and will continue to participate in price promotions with its wholesalers and their retail customers 
management believes that the number and frequency of the company s promotions will increase during variability of margins and operating results 
the company anticipates that its operating margins will fluctuate and may decline as a result of many factors  including i lower sales volumes and selling prices  ii increased depreciation and other fixed and semi fixed operating costs as a percent of sales during periods when the company s breweries are producing below designed capacity  iii increased raw material and packaging costs  iv changes in product mix and packaging  v increased transportation costs  vi increased sales from retail operations which may have a lower gross margin as a percentage of net sales than beer sales  and vii increased selling and promotional costs incurred as the company protects its business in existing markets 
increases in federal or state excise taxes and the impact of an increasing average federal excise tax rate as production increases may also cause a decline in the company s gross margins 
the company pays federal excise taxes on all beer sales and pays state excise taxes on beer sales occurring in various states at various tax rates 
the federal excise tax is per barrel on the first  barrels and per barrel exceeding  annually  as long as total annual sales are less than two million barrels 
the washington state excise tax is per barrel annually and the california state excise tax is per barrel annually 
results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for future periods 
fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of the company s common stock 
in future quarters  the company s operating results may not meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such an event  the market price of the common stock could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents impact of inflation although the company has not attempted to calculate the effect of inflation  management does not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
in the future  increases in costs and expenses  particularly energy  packaging  raw materials and labor costs may have a significant impact on the company s operating results to the extent that such cost increases cannot be passed along to its customers
