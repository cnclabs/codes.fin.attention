overview we design  develop and manufacture innovative  high quality broadband communications products that enable voice  data and image transport over fiber optic  broadband cable and wireless communications networks around the world 
our products are comprised of advanced  highly functional components and integrated assemblies which address the rf challenges of both current and next generation broadband communications networks 
these products are used in the network infrastructure supporting and facilitating mobile communications  broadband high speed data transmission and enhanced voice services 
our core expertise in gallium arsenide semiconductor and thin film technology  coupled with our exceptional rf design  integration  and manufacturing capabilities  have enabled us to obtain a competitive advantage in these broadband communications markets 
when we began our operations in the broadband commercial communications market  we benefited from the significant increases in spending on capital equipment by communications service providers 
however  towards the end of and in  several of our major customers significantly delayed and reduced their demand for our fiber optic and wireless products 
the primary reason for these delays and reductions in their recent and forecasted demand is an overall slow down in capital spending by communication service providers 
we believe that this slow down relates to two primary items 
first  our customers have indicated that there has been a significant build up of their inventory as well as a significant build up of uninstalled equipment at communication service providers 
we believe that numerous service providers have reduced their capital expenditures until they have installed their excess inventory of equipment  which they have already purchased  and begin generating revenue from this uninstalled equipment 
in addition  based on the slow down in capital expenditures  our customers are attempting to reduce their inventory levels 
secondly  we believe that numerous early stage communication service providers  who have previously been able to access the capital markets  are having difficulties in finding new sources of capital and in certain instances these companies have filed for bankruptcy 
as a result  we believe that these companies have had to greatly reduce their capital expenditures 
on a long term basis  we believe that the demand for broadband communications equipment and our products will rebound 
throughout  we have introduced several new products in each of our three product categories 
these new products will further position us to benefit from the roll out of the following broadband communications technologies g and g wireless  and oc and oc for both the metro and long haul fiber optics markets 
during  we introduced over twenty new semiconductor products primarily targeted at wireless infrastructure applications 
during  we also had many new socket wins at major oems 
additionally  during the first half of  we expanded our thin film capabilities by introducing a new polished aluminum nitride process 
during  we also introduced over ten new fiber products including oc modulator drivers  clock amplifiers and filter products 
during the fourth quarter of  we announced an alliance with fujitsu quantum devices ltd 
for joint development of gb s optical products for oc applications 
while customer interest  new product introductions  additional design wins  strategic alliances and new orders are encouraging  there is no assurance that they will have a positive impact on our overall sales 
our manufacturing operations are highly automated which has required us to make significant investments in equipment and fixed overhead 
as a result  the volume of product we produce and sell has a significant impact on our gross profit margin 
until demand increases  the slow down in spending on broadband communications equipment will negatively impact our gross margin 
in addition  we typically generate lower gross margin on new product introductions 
over time  we typically become more efficient relative to new products through learning and increased volumes as well as through introducing lower cost elements to the product designs 
we expect our new product introductions to continue to be a higher percentage of our sales mix  which will continue to have a temporary negative impact on our gross margin 
as we broaden our product lines we must purchase a wider variety of components to utilize in our manufacturing processes 
in addition  new product lines contain a greater degree of uncertainty due to a lack of visibility and predictability of customer demand and potential competition 
both of these factors will contribute a higher level of inventory risk in our near future 
over the course of  we have taken aggressive steps designed to more closely align our production costs with our customers current forecasted demand for our products 
as part of this effort  we have reduced our workforce by approximately  incurring approximately million in severance related costs 
we have also saved an additional million during the second half of by reducing non employee costs including sales and marketing  general and administrative  and overhead expenses 
our cost reduction initiatives also include temporary shutdowns of our manufacturing facilities and significant reductions in capital spending 
in addition to our cost reduction efforts  we have abandoned our excess san jose facility and recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
this abandonment reduced our selling and administrative expenses by approximately  in the second half of and is expected to reduce our selling and administrative expense by approximately  per quarter going forward 
while our continuing efforts are expected to further reduce our expense levels  we still have a significant amount of fixed manufacturing cost that these efforts will not impact and our expense reduction initiatives alone will not return us to profitability 
we expect that reduced end customer demand  underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and other factors will continue to adversely affect our operating results in the near term and we anticipate incurring additional losses in in order to return to profitability  we must achieve substantial revenue growth and we currently face an environment of uncertain demand in the markets our products address 
we cannot assure you as to whether or when we will return to profitability or whether we will be able to sustain such profitability  if achieved 
sales we sell our products predominantly to large equipment manufacturers and service providers in the fiber optic  broadband cable and wireless network infrastructure markets 
our major customers provide forecasted demand on at least a monthly basis  which assists us in allocating our manufacturing capacity 
these forecasts  however  are subject to changes  including changes as a result of market conditions  and could fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we depend on a small number of customers for a majority of our sales 
during the year ended december   we had four customers which each accounted for more than of our sales and in aggregate accounted for of our sales 
those customers were lucent technologies  marconi communications  nortel networks and richardson electronics including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors 
during the year ended december   we had two customers which each accounted for more than of our sales and in aggregate accounted for approximately of our sales 
those customers were lucent technologies and nortel networks including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors 
we have diversified our customer base over the last few years and intend to further diversify our customer base and product offering in the future 
however  we anticipate that we will continue to sell a majority of our products to a relatively small group of customers 
in addition  most of our sales result from purchase orders or contracts that can be cancelled on short term notice 
delays in manufacturing or supply procurement or other factors  including general market slow downs  have caused and could potentially continue to cause cancellation  reduction or delay in orders by or in shipments to a significant customer 
based on specific terms of the customer contract and purchase order  we may negotiate a final delivery and settlement in connection with order cancellations 
due to the uncertain and often lengthy nature of these negotiations  a substantial portion  if not all  of the inventory subject to the cancellation may be provided for as part of our excess and obsolete inventory provision 
in the fourth quarter of  we reached final agreement with one customer  marconi communications  and recognized revenue of million related to the delivery of specific fixed wireless products that have previously been reserved for 
we anticipate that similar arrangements will be made with other customers for final deliveries of less than million over the first half of in addition to our core business 
since the fourth quarter of we have experienced a sequential reduction in demand for our wireless base station and oc fiber optic products which continued throughout also  during  we have experienced a reduction in and push out of demand for our gaas semiconductors 
in addition  since the fourth quarter of and throughout  three of our largest customers  lucent  nortel and marconi  issued press releases discussing the slow down in telecom spending which has resulted in reduced demand for their products and major reductions in their work forces 
in march  lucent and nortel issued press releases disclosing reduced customer orders to date in our orders from these major customers fell significantly in and there can be no assurance that orders will increase in or not continue to decline 
while we have seen some limited recovery in orders for our mobile wireless products  we expect this slow down in telecom spending to continue in the near term based on customer forecasts for the purchase of our products 
the greater the slow down in demand becomes  the more significant the potential negative impact on our sales  earnings  inventory valuations and cash flow 
revenues from product sales are recognized when all of the following conditions are met the product has been shipped  the company has the right to invoice the customer at a fixed price  the collection of the receivable is probable and there are no significant obligations remaining 
generally  title passes upon shipment of the company s products 
beginning in march  our contract with lucent converted to a consignment arrangement under which title to certain of our products does not pass until lucent utilizes these products in its production processes 
consequently  we recognize revenue on this contract only when lucent notifies us of product consumption 
nortel converted its purchases of certain products to a similar consignment arrangement in october  consequently  we recognize revenue on these contracts only when they notify us of product consumption 
in addition to our internal sales efforts  we use distributors to sell semiconductor products 
revenues from distributors are recognized upon shipment based on the following factors our sales price is fixed and determinable by contract at the time of shipment  payment terms are fixed at shipment and are consistent with terms granted to other customers  the distributor has full risk of physical loss  the distributors have separate economic substance  we have no obligation with respect to the resale of the distributors inventory  and we believe we can reasonably estimate the potential returns from our distributors based on their history and our visibility in the distributors success with its products and into the market place in general 
during the quarter ending july   the company began using two distributors for sales of certain fixed wireless products 
lacking history with these new distributors  we are recording revenue on these fixed wireless products at the time of the distributors sale to the ultimate end customer 
we provide a warranty on standard products and components and products developed for specific customer or program applications 
such warranty generally ranges from to months 
we estimate the warranty cost based on our historical field return rates 
to date  we have had no significant warranty returns 
we include warranty expense related to these products in cost of goods sold 
generally  the selling prices of our products decrease over time as a result of increased volumes and general competitive pressures 
we expect that prices will continue to decline as a result of volume increases and these competitive pressures 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct material costs of product components  production wages  taxes and benefits  costs of assembly by third party contract manufacturers  labor contracted on a temporary basis  supplies consumed in the manufacturing process  depreciation and amortization of manufacturing equipment and leasehold improvements  lease expense for our manufacturing facilities  allocated occupancy costs  scrapped material used in the production process  and provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
we recognize cost of goods sold upon recognition of revenue 
we recognize losses on contracts  including purchase order commitments  when identified 
operating expenses our operating expenses are classified into two general categories research and development  and selling and administrative 
we classify all charges to these two categories based on the nature of the expenditures 
although each of these two categories includes expenses that are unique to the category type  there are commonly recurring expenditures that are typically included in these categories  such as wages  fringe benefit costs  depreciation and allocated overhead 
research and development research and development expense represents wages  supplies and allocated overhead costs to design  develop and improve products and processes 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
selling and administrative selling and administrative expense consists primarily of wages  travel and facility costs incurred by and other expenses allocated to our selling and administrative departments 
selling and administrative expense also includes manufacturer representatives and distributor sales commissions  trade show and advertising expenses and fees and expenses of legal  accounting  and other professional consultants 
amortization of deferred stock compensation we have recorded deferred stock compensation representing the differential between the deemed fair value of our common stock and the exercise price at the date of grant for options or date of sale for stock purchases 
we are amortizing this amount using the straight line method over the vesting period of the options granted 
recapitalization merger and other recapitalization merger and other expense is a non recurring expenditure comprised of employee retention and severance compensation  legal  professional and other costs associated with our recapitalization merger and the sale of our telecommunications group 
restructuring charge restructuring charge reflects our decision to abandon a new leased facility based on revised anticipated demand for our products and current market conditions 
it is comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sub lease income  broker commissions and other facility costs  and an asset impairment charge on tenant improvements 
in determining this estimate  we have made certain assumptions with regards to our ability to sub lease the space and have reflected off setting assumed sub lease income in line with our best estimate of current market conditions 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a continuous basis  we evaluate all our significant estimates including those related to doubtful accounts receivable  inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets  income taxes  restructuring including accruals for abandoned lease properties  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for a detailed discussion of all our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
in addition  failure to obtain anticipated orders or delays or cancellations of orders or significant pressure to reduce prices from key customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue 
based on specific terms of the customer contract and purchase order  we may negotiate a final delivery and settlement in connection with order cancellations 
due to the uncertain and often lengthy nature of these negotiations  a substantial portion  if not all  of the inventory subject to the cancellation may be provided for as part of our excess and obsolete inventory provision 
in the fourth quarter of  we reached final agreement with one customer  marconi communications  and recognized revenue of million related to the delivery of specific fixed wireless products that have previously been reserved for 
we anticipate that similar arrangements will be made with other customers for final deliveries of less than million over the first half of in addition to our core business 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historic bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of expenses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
our allowances for doubtful accounts were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
approximately of our accounts receivable as of december  was concentrated with our top four customers  each  including their respective manufacturing subcontractors  accounting for more than of our sales and in aggregate accounting for of our sales 
provision for excess and obsolete inventory we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage  forecasted production based on demand forecasts  current economic trends and historical write offs when evaluating the adequacy of the provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
due to rapidly changing customer forecast and orders  additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory  while not currently expected  could be required in the future 
in addition  the sale of previously written down inventory could result from significant unforeseen increases in customer demand 
material differences in estimates of excess and obsolete inventory may result in the amount and timing of cost of sales for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax provision benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current income tax provision benefit together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
management believes that it its more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realized through refunds from the carryback of the current year net operating loss and any projected net operating loss for as of december   our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was million 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for contingencies  we have established certain reserves for income tax contingencies 
these reserves relate to various tax years subject to audit by tax authorities including our federal tax filings for to which are currently being examined 
as of december   our income tax reserve was million  which we believe is adequate 
however  the ultimate outcome of this estimate may differ from our estimates and the difference may be material 
restructuring in september  we decided not to occupy a new leased facility based on revised anticipated demand for our products and current market conditions 
this excess facility  for which we have a ten year commitment  is located adjacent to our current corporate headquarters and was originally developed to house additional administrative and corporate offices to accommodate planned expansion 
this decision has resulted in a pre tax lease loss of million  comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sub lease income  broker commissions and other facility costs  and a pre tax asset impairment charge of million on tenant improvements deemed no longer realizable 
in determining this estimate  we have made certain assumptions with regards to our ability to sub lease the space and have reflected off setting assumed sub lease income in line with our best estimate of current market conditions 
should there be a significant change in those market conditions  the ultimate loss could be higher and such amount could be material 
we have signed one tenant to cover a portion of the excess leased space 
any sub lease tenants are subject to the landlord s consent 
the lease loss is an estimate under sfas no 
accounting for contingencies and represents the low end of the range and adjustments will be made in future periods  if necessary  based upon the then current actual events and circumstances 
we have estimated that the high end of the lease loss could be million if operating lease rental rates continue to decrease or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant or tenants to sub lease the facility 
as of december   our restructuring accrual was million 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected  future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or significant technological changes  which would render equipment and manufacturing process  obsolete 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of these assets to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
through december   the company has not experienced any such impairments 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of projected discounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of our long lived assets could occur 
current operations the following table sets forth certain statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated 
as a result of our new products  our increased infrastructure  changing market conditions and other factors  the historical percentages and comparisions set forth below may not reflect our expected future operations 
percentage of sales year ended december  consolidated statements of operations data sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling and administrative amortization of deferred stock compensation recapitalization merger and other restructuring charge total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income interest expense other income expense net gain on dispositions of real property income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision benefit income loss from continuing operations 
comparison of years ended december  and sales we recognized million and million in sales for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
this million or decrease in sales resulted primarily from an decrease in fiber optic sales of oc oscillators for use in long haul fiber optic systems 
fiber optic sales decreased to million as our sales continued to be impacted by the overall weakness in the long haul fiber optic market 
fiber optic sales represented of total sales for wireless product sales during totaled million  representing of total sales and a decrease of over semiconductor sales during totaled million  representing of total sales and a decrease of over based on specific terms of the customer contract and purchase order  we may negotiate a final delivery and settlement in connection with order cancellations 
due to the uncertain and often lengthy nature of these negotiations  a substantial portion  if not all  of the inventory subject to the cancellation may be provided for as part of our excess and obsolete inventory provision 
in the fourth quarter of  we reached final agreement with one customer  marconi communications  and recognized revenue of million related to the delivery of specific fixed wireless products that have previously been reserved for 
we anticipate that similar arrangements will be made with other customers for final deliveries of less than million over the first half of in addition to our core business 
moving forward  we continue to be cautious about the current market environment  but we believe that our core business will generate approximately to million in quarterly sales over the first half of however  there can be no assurance that we will generate such a level of sales 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold for was million  a decrease of million or as compared with cost of goods sold of million in the decrease in cost of goods sold primarily relates to our decrease in sales 
as a percentage of sales  our cost of goods sold increased to of sales in from in the increase in our cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales relates to significant unabsorbed overhead  a million provision for excess and obsolete inventory  approximately  of severance expenses related to manufacturing personnel  and high variable cost on fixed wireless products which were being transitioned into manufacturing 
the significant amount of unabsorbed overhead costs relates to the increased manufacturing infrastructure we put in place to support our customers demand in the second half of this increased infrastructure includes  among other things  a new manufacturing facility and investments in machinery and equipment 
during the first quarter of  we recorded a million provision for excess and obsolete inventory largely related to inventory ordered to build base station products for our largest mobile wireless customer 
inventory levels of this product were purchased based on this customer s forecasted demand which had since been dramatically revised downward 
in addition  given the overall slowdown in market demand  we made provisions for other product lines where customer forecasts have significantly declined 
since the first quarter of  approximately million of our previously reserved inventory was consumed by our largest mobile wireless customer 
this decrease in our inventory reserve was offset by an additional million in provisions for other product lines where customer demand has significantly weakened 
in total  the amount of our provision for excess and obsolete inventory remained unchanged since the first quarter of due to rapidly changing customer forecasts and orders  additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory  while not currently expected  could be required in the future 
in addition  the sale of previously written down inventory could result from significant unforeseen increases in customer demand 
with respect to our fixed wireless products  we typically experience higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of the selling price during the early stages of a new product life cycle 
over time  we typically become more efficient through learning and increased volumes  as well as through introducing lower cost elements in the product design 
margin improvement on our fixed wireless products has remained unrealized due to very low volume production during the second half of given the current economic slowdown  the added capacity from our new manufacturing facility and equipment may not be fully utilized and the ongoing costs thereof will still be incurred until such time as the market demand for our products increases 
research and development our research and development expense for was million  a decrease of million or as compared with research and development expense of million in the decrease in research and development was primarily attributed to lower overall overhead costs and an increase in customer funded development 
as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses increased to of sales in from of sales in the increase in research and development expense as a percentage of sales primarily relates to our decline in sales 
product research and development is essential to our future success and we expect to continue to make investments in new product development 
selling and administrative selling and administrative expense for was million or of sales  a decrease of million or as compared with selling and administrative expense of million or of sales in the decrease in absolute dollars is primarily related to lower commission  recruiting  advertising and promotion expenses partially offset by approximately  of severance expenses and rent expense associated with our two new facilities including excess office space through august  see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
as a percentage of sales  the increase in selling and administrative expense reflected the significant decrease in sales during amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of deferred stock compensation expense in includes approximately  related to the issuance of stock options during at prices deemed below fair market value 
amortization of deferred stock compensation expense in includes approximately million related to the sale of stock and issuance of stock options during at prices deemed below fair market value 
as of december   the balance of our remaining unamortized deferred stock compensation was approximately  to be amortized over the next months 
recapitalization merger and other we incurred recapitalization merger and other expense of million in related to our recapitalization merger 
these expenses include million of compensation expense related to payments to former option holders  million of compensation expense related to bonus  retention  and severance amounts for certain employees  million of legal  consulting and accounting fees  and million of financial services and other expenses related to the recapitalization merger transaction 
restructuring charge for  we have recorded a restructuring charge of million related to our decision to abandon our excess facility 
in september  we decided not to occupy a new leased facility based on revised anticipated demand for our products and current market conditions 
this excess facility  for which we have a ten year commitment  is located adjacent to our current corporate headquarters and was originally developed to house additional administrative and corporate offices to accommodate planned expansion 
this decision has resulted in a pre tax lease loss of million  comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sub lease income  broker commissions and other facility costs  and a pre tax asset impairment charge of million on tenant improvements deemed no longer realizable 
in determining this estimate  we have made certain assumptions with regards to our ability to sub lease the space and have reflected off setting assumed sub lease income in line with our best estimate of current market conditions 
should there be a significant change in those market conditions  the ultimate loss could be higher and such amount could be material 
we have signed one tenant to occupy a portion of the excess leased space 
any sub lease tenants are subject to the landlord s consent 
the lease loss is an estimate under sfas no 
accounting for contingencies and represents the low end of the range and adjustments will be made in future periods  if necessary  based upon the then current actual events and circumstances 
we have estimated that the high end of the lease loss could be million if operating lease rental rates continue to decrease or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant or tenants to sub lease the facility 
total cash outlay for the restructuring is expected to be million  with million accrued at december  and approximately  paid out through december  of the balance in accrued liabilities as of december   the company expects approximately  of the lease loss to be paid out over the next twelve months  and the remaining million to be paid out over the remaining life of the lease of approximately nine years 
interest income interest income primarily represents interest earned on cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments 
our interest income for was million  a decrease of approximately  or as compared with interest income of million in this decrease primarily resulted from decreased average amounts of funds available for investment and a decrease in interest rates 
to the extent we continue to utilize our cash in the operation of our business  interest income is expected to decrease going forward 
additionally  our interest income will be impacted by changes in the market interest rates of our investments  which are generally lower than they were a year ago 
interest expense our interest expense for was  a decrease of million or as compared with interest expense of million in interest expense during relates to fees associated with our revolving credit facility and outstanding letters of credit 
the expense incurred during resulted from interest expense related to our credit facility with cibc world markets corp  which we entered into as part of the recapitalization merger and fully repaid with a portion of the net proceeds from our initial public offering 
other income expense net the other income realized in was primarily related to a  realized gain on the sale of short term investments  a business interruption insurance settlement of  net of expenses  related to a power outage at our milpitas facility and a  refund of an insurance premium for potential environmental liabilities on our former scotts valley facility 
the other expense incurred in is primarily related to losses realized when we liquidated short term investments to fund in part the recapitalization merger and to higher facility cost associated with our palo alto sub lease 
gain on dispositions of real property during  we recorded a gain on dispositions of real property related to the release of  of escrow funds related to our sale of leasehold interests in our palo alto site during the fourth quarter of this gain was partially offset by  of residual expenses from the sale of the property 
in  our pre tax gain on the dispositions of real property of million primarily related to our sale of the remaining leasehold interest in our palo alto site which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
we vacated this site in october of income tax provision benefit our effective tax rate in was a tax benefit of as compared to a tax provision of in our effective tax benefit rate for approximates our combined federal and state effective tax rates adjusted primarily for valuation allowances against those deferred tax assets that management believes are not more likely than not to be realized as well as a reduction of certain taxes payable deemed no longer required 
the effective tax rate of reflects the impact of certain nondeductible expenses related to our recapitalization merger 
beginning in  we have elected to not benefit on going future net operating losses 
comparison of years ended december  and sales sales increased in to million from million in primarily due to strong demand from our largest customer for our oc oscillators which are used in their oc fiber optic systems 
our fiber optic sales increased million or in to million 
we also had strong growth in our semiconductor sales  which increased in to million 
during  our wireless product sales declined to million primarily due to the completion  in the second quarter of  of a large fixed wireless project in an emerging market 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased to million in from million in the increase in cost of sales primarily relates to our increase in sales 
as a percentage of sales  our cost of sales increased to of sales in from in the increase in our cost of sales as a percentage of sales relates to higher levels of overhead associated with our new expanded facility in san jose california which supports our fiber optic and wireless manufacturing 
research and development research and development expense increased in to million from million in the increase in research and development was primarily attributed to increased spending on development of wireless broadband access  semiconductor and fiber optic products 
as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses declined to of sales in from of sales in the decline as a percentage of sales is primarily related to expenses not increasing at the same rate as sales growth 
selling and administrative selling and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in selling and administrative related to increased spending on sales and marketing  recruiting and human resources  our relocation to our new facility in san jose and increases in our bad debt allowance 
the increase in our bad debt allowance of million was primarily due to a bankruptcy filing by one of our customers and an increase in potentially uncollectible accounts receivable as our sales grew rapidly 
as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expenses increased to of sales in from of sales in the increase in selling and administrative as a percentage of sales primarily related to increases in our bad debt reserve and cost associated with our relocation to our new facility 
amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of deferred stock compensation expense in includes approximately million related to the sale of stock and issuance of stock options at prices deemed below fair market value 
recapitalization merger and other we incurred recapitalization merger and other expense of million in related to our recapitalization merger 
these expenses include million of compensation expense related to payments to former option holders  million of compensation expense related to bonus  retention  and severance amounts for certain employees  million of legal  consulting and accounting fees  and million of financial services and other expenses related to the recapitalization merger transaction 
in  we incurred million in recapitalization merger and other cost related to our sale of our telecommunications group as well as to our recapitalization merger 
interest income interest income primarily represents interest earned on cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments 
interest income decreased to million in from million in this decrease primarily resulted from decreased average amounts of funds available for investment 
interest expense interest expense increased to million in from  in this increase resulted primarily from interest expense related to our credit facility with cibc world markets corp 
which we entered into as part of the recapitalization merger 
the outstanding borrowings on this line of credit were repaid with a portion of the net proceeds from our initial public offering 
other income expense net other income expense net  decreased to million of other expense in from  of other income in this decrease is primarily related to losses realized in the first quarter of when we liquidated short term investments to fund in part the recapitalization merger 
gain on dispositions of real property during  our pre tax gain on the dispositions of real property of million primarily related to our sale of the remaining leasehold interest in our palo alto site which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
we vacated this site in october of in  we completed the sale of our san jose  california  facility including a  square foot building  resulting in net proceeds about million and a pretax gain of million 
this property was vacated in also in  we completed the sale of one of our long term lease interests in palo alto  california to stanford university  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million and a pre tax gain of million 
income tax provision benefit our effective tax rate in was as compared to in the primary reason our effective tax rate was significantly higher than the statutory tax rate relates to the impact of certain nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with our recapitalization merger 
extraordinary item  net of taxes during the third quarter of  we repaid all of the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and wrote off  as an extraordinary item  the remaining unamortized deferred financing cost of million before income taxes of million 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  were million  a decrease of million or compared to the balance of million at december  in december of  we entered into a million revolving credit facility revolving facility with a bank 
the revolving facility matures on december  and contains a million sub limit to support letters of credit 
interest rates on outstanding borrowings are periodically adjusted based on certain financial ratios and are initially set  at our option  at libor plus or prime minus 
the revolving facility requires that we maintain certain financial ratios and contains limitations on  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness  pay dividends and make acquisitions without the bank s permission 
we were in compliance with the covenants as of december  the revolving facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving facility 
our federal tax filings for to are currently being examined and if the outcome is unfavorable we will need to pay substantial taxes and penalties which will have an adverse impact on our cash position 
we currently have approximately million as a contingent liability related to various tax years subject to audit by tax authorities net cash provided used by continuing operating activities net cash provided used by continuing operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net income loss in  and was comprised of million  million and million from continuing operations  respectively  and million and million from discontinued operations for and  respectively 
during  we also incurred a million loss net of income tax from an extraordinary item arising from the early extinguishment of debt 
significant items impacting the difference between net income from continuing operations and cash flows from continuing operations in were million used by working capital  a million increase in our restructuring accrual  an increase of million in deferred tax assets  and a million increase in our provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
the million used in working capital relates to a million decrease in accruals  payables and income taxes and a million increase in inventories which were partially offset by a million decrease in receivables and a million decrease in other assets 
the million decrease in accruals  payables and income taxes was partially related to a million income tax payment generated primarily from the approximately million pre tax gain from the sale of our remaining palo alto leasehold interest during our fourth quarter of significant items impacting the difference between loss from continuing operations and cash flows from continuing operations in were million used in working capital  million of recapitalization merger cost and million of net gains on the disposal of property  plant and equipment 
the net gain on the disposal of property  plant and equipment primarily relates to a million gain on the sale of real estate 
the million used in working capital relates to a million increase in inventories and a million increase in receivables which were partially offset by a million increase in accruals  payables and income taxes and a million decrease in other assets 
significant items impacting the difference between net income from continuing operations and cash flows from continuing operations in were million used in working capital  net gains on the disposition of property  plant and equipment of million and million provided by the utilization of deferred tax assets 
the million net gain on property  plant and equipment was primarily related to a million gain on the sale of real estate 
the million used in working capital relates to a million decrease in accruals  payables and income taxes which was partially offset by a million decrease in receivables and a million decrease in other assets 
net cash provided used by investing activities net cash provided used by investing activities was  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  we used million to purchase short term investments and million to invest in property  plant and equipment which were largely offset by million provided by our sale of short term investments 
in  our investing activities provided cash of million from the sale of short term investments  million from the sale of our telecommunications segment and proceeds related to the release of escrow from our previous discontinued operations  and million of proceeds from real estate sales and asset retirements which was partially offset by million used to purchase short term investments and million used to invest in property  plant and equipment 
in  our investing activities provided cash of million from the sale of short term investments  million from the sale of discontinued operations and million from the proceeds on real estate sales and asset retirements which were partially offset by million from the purchase of short term investments and million from the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
during  we expect to invest approximately to million in capital expenditures 
we have funded our capital expenditures from cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and expect to continue to do so throughout net cash provided used by financing activities net cash provided used by financing activities totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  we received net cash of approximately million from the sale of our common stock to employees through our employee stock purchase and option plans 
in  our net cash used in financing activities primarily related to our recapitalization merger where we repurchased million of common stock and incurred million in recapitalization merger cost which was partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock of million including our initial public offering in august  in our net cash used in financing activities primarily related to million in recapitalization merger and other cost and million in dividends paid partially offset by the issuance of common stock for million 
based on our current plans and business conditions  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments together with our expected cash flows from operations and anticipated available borrowings under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital spending requirements for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  we will utilize our cash  cash flows and borrowings to the extent available and  if desirable or necessary  we may seek to raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity 
there can be no assurances  however  that future borrowings and capital resources will be available on favorable terms or at all 
our cash flows are highly dependent on demand for our products  timing of orders and shipments with key customers and our ability to manage our working capital  especially inventory and accounts receivable  as well as controlling our production and operating costs in line with our revenue

recent events related to our independent auditor  arthur andersen on march  our independent certified public accountant  arthur andersen  llp  was indicted on federal charges of obstruction of justice in connection with the us government s investigation of enron 
we are required to file periodic financial statements with the sec which have been audited or reviewed by an independent  certified public accountant 
the sec has issued a release stating that it will continue to accept financial statements audited by arthur andersen  and interim financial statements reviewed by it  so long as arthur andersen is able to make certain representations to us 
while arthur andersen has made the sec required representations to us in connection with our audited financial statements for  there can be no assurance that arthur andersen will be able to do so in the future  that the sec will continue to accept financial statements audited or reviewed by arthur andersen or that arthur andersen will be able to perform the required services for us 
in such case  we will promptly seek to engage new independent certified public accountants to perform audit related services for us 
our ability to timely file our required periodic reports could be impaired if arthur andersen becomes unable to make the required representations to us  the sec ceases accepting financial statements audited or reviewed by arthur andersen or if for any other reason arthur andersen is unable to perform audit related services for us 
if we are unable to timely file our required periodic reports it could have a material adverse effect on us 
risk factors that may affect future results you should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec in evaluating us and our business before making an investment decision 
if any of the following risks  or other risks and uncertainties that we have not yet identified or that we currently think are immaterial  actually occur and are material  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose part or all of your investment 
we have recently incurred substantial operating losses and we anticipate additional future losses 
our sales for were million compared to million for due to sharply reduced end customer demand in many of the communications end markets which our products address 
we incurred a net loss of million for we expect that reduced end customer demand  underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and other factors will continue to adversely affect our operating results in the near term and we anticipate incurring additional losses in in order to return to profitability  we must achieve substantial revenue growth and we currently face an environment of uncertain demand in the markets our products address 
we cannot assure you as to whether or when we will return to profitability or whether we will be able to sustain such profitability  if achieved 
several customers account for a high percentage of our sales and the loss of  or a reduction in orders from  a significant customer could result in a loss of sales 
we depend on a small number of customers for a majority of our sales 
during the year ended december   we had four customers which each accounted for more than of our sales and in aggregate accounted for of our sales 
those customers were lucent technologies  marconi communications  nortel networks and richardson electronics including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors 
during the year ended december   we had two customers which each accounted for more than of our sales and in aggregate accounted for approximately of our sales 
those customers were lucent technologies and nortel networks including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors 
in addition  most of our sales result from purchase orders or from contracts that can be cancelled on short term notice 
we anticipate that we will continue to sell a majority of our products to a relatively small group of customers 
the loss of or a reduction in orders from  a significant customer for any reason could cause our sales to decrease 
during our fourth quarter of we began to experience a sequential reduction in demand for our wireless base station and oc optical products which has continued into the first quarter of also  during  we have experienced a reduction in and push out of demand for our gaas semiconductors 
in addition  since the fourth quarter of and throughout  three of our largest customers  lucent  nortel and marconi issued press releases discussing the slow down in telecom spending which has resulted in reduced demand for their products and major reductions in their work forces 
in march  lucent and nortel issued press releases disclosing reduced customer orders to date in our orders from these major customers fell significantly during and there can be no assurance that orders will increase in or not continue to decline 
while we have seen some limited recovery in orders for our mobile wireless and gaas semiconductor products  we expect this general slow down in telecom spending to continue in the near term based on customer forecasts for the purchase of our products 
the greater the slowdown in demand becomes  the more significant the potential negative impact on our sales  earnings  inventory valuations and cash flow 
our future success depends in significant part on strategic relationships with certain of our customers 
if we cannot maintain these relationships or if these customers develop their own solution or adopt a competitor s solutions instead of buying our products  our operating results would be adversely affected 
in the past  we have relied on our strategic relationships with certain customers who are technology leaders in our target markets 
we intend to pursue and continue to form these strategic relationships in the future but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
these relationships often require us to develop new products that typically involve significant technological challenges 
our partners frequently place considerable pressure on us to meet their tight development schedules 
accordingly  we may have to devote a substantial amount of our limited resources to our strategic relationships  which could detract from or delay our completion of other important development projects 
delays in development could impair our relationships with our strategic partners and negatively impact sales of the products under development 
moreover  it is possible that our customers may develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor s solution for products that they currently buy from us 
if that happens  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly 
as a result  we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
if our operating results do not meet our publicly stated guidance or the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price may decline 
fluctuations in our operating results may be due to a number of factors  including the following continued slow down in capital spending by communications service providers the volume of our product sales and pricing concessions on volume sales  the timing  rescheduling  reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders  the gain or loss of a key customer  the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effect on sales and pricing of our products  our ability to specify  develop  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a timely manner and the acceptance of our new products by our customers  the timing of customer industry qualification and certification of our products and the risks of non qualification or non certification  the rate of which our present and future customers and end users adopt our technologies in our target markets  the rate of adoption and acceptance of new industry standards in our target markets  the effects of new and emerging technologies  intellectual property disputes and customer indemnification claims  the risks inherent in our acquisitions of technologies and businesses  including the timing and successful completion of technology and product development through volume production  integration issues  costs and unanticipated expenditures  change relationships with customers  suppliers and strategic partners  potential contractual  intellectual property or employment issues  accounting treatment and charges  and the risks that the acquisition cannot be completed successfully or that anticipated benefits are not realized  the effectiveness of our product cost reduction efforts  fluctuations in our manufacturing yields and other problems or delays in the fabrication  assembly  testing or delivery of our products  changes in manufacturing capacity and the utilization of this capacity  the risks of producing products with new suppliers and at new fabrication and assembly facilities  our ability to retain and hire key executives  technical personnel and other employees in the numbers  with the capabilities and at the compensation levels that we need to implement our business and product plans  changes in our product mix or customer mix  the extent and duration of the current downturn in the economy and the weakness in demand by our customers  lack of visibility into the finished product inventories of our customers and end users  increased in house production by our customers  continued excessive inventories held by our customers or end users  the quality of our products and any remediation costs  the effects of natural disasters and other events beyond our control  the level of orders received that we can ship in a fiscal quarter  our inability to utilize our line of credit or comply with its terms  the availability and affordability of raw materials  cyclical nature of semiconductor business  continued reduction or loss of customer orders due to economic and business factors affecting our customers  increased warranty claims  recognition of non recurring revenue generated from life time buys of discontinued products or settlements of contract cancellations for orders containing inventory protection clauses  the eventual actual cost of our abandonment of our lease facility  our ability to sub lease the excess space we abandoned in our leased facility  our ability to successfully complete our restructuring program  the impact of international conflicts and acts of terrorism on economic and market conditions  continued poor economic and market conditions in our industry  and general economic and market conditions 
due to all of the foregoing factors  and the other risks discussed in this report  you should not rely on period to period comparisons of our operating results as an indication of future performance 
if we are unable to respond to the rapid technological change taking place in our industry  our existing products could become obsolete and we could face difficulties making future sales 
the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards and frequent improvements in products and services 
if the technologies supported by our products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread acceptance  as a result of a change in industry standards or otherwise  we could face difficulties making future sales 
our future success will depend on factors including our ability to enhance the functionality of existing products in a timely and cost effective manner  establish close working relationships with major customers for the design of their new fiber optic or wireless transmission systems that incorporate our products  identify  develop and achieve market acceptance of new products that address new technologies and meet customer needs in the fiber optic  broadband cable and wireless communications markets  apply expertise and technologies to existing and emerging fiber optic  broadband cable or wireless communications markets  and produce new products cost efficiently 
we must continue to make significant investments in research and development to seek to develop product enhancements  new designs and technologies 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products or enhancements in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  or if our new products do not achieve market acceptance  our sales could decline 
our existing and potential customers operate in an intensely competitive environment and our success will depend on the success of our customers 
the companies in our target markets  communications equipment companies and service providers  face an extremely competitive environment 
most of the fiber optic and wireless products we design and sell are customized to work with specific customer s systems 
if the companies with whom we establish business relations are not successful in building their systems  promoting their products  including new revenue generating services  receiving requisite approvals and accomplishing the many other requirements for the success of their businesses  our growth will be limited 
furthermore  our customers may have difficulty obtaining parts from other suppliers causing these customers to cancel or delay orders for our products 
moreover  our customers success is affected by a number of factors  many of which are out of our control  including product life cycles and new product introductions  success of their products  manufacturing strategy and changes in inventory levels  their accessibility to financing  regulatory approvals  competitive conditions  and contract awards 
in addition  we have limited ability to foresee the competitive success of our customers and to plan accordingly 
if the fiber optic  broadband cable and wireless communications markets fail to grow or they decline  our sales may not grow or may decline 
our future growth depends on the success of the fiber optic  broadband cable and wireless communications markets 
the rate at which these markets will grow is difficult to predict 
these markets may fail to grow or decline for many reasons  including insufficient consumer demand for fiber optic  broadband cable or wireless products or services  the inability of the various communications service providers to access adequate capital to build their networks  the inability of fiber optic or wireless communications service providers to handle growing demands for faster transmission of increasing amounts of data for broadband applications  inefficiency and poor performance of fiber optic  broadband cable or wireless communications services compared to other forms of broadband access  and real or perceived security or health risks associated with wireless communications 
during  the demand for telecom equipment has been very soft and is projected to continue during the first quarter of and potentially beyond 
if the markets for our products in fiber optic  broadband cable or wireless communications fail to grow  or grow more slowly than we anticipate  the use of our products may decline and our sales could suffer 
if the internet does not continue to expand and broadband access technologies are not deployed to satisfy the increased bandwidth requirements as we anticipate  sales of our products may decline 
our future success depends on the continued growth of the internet as a widely used medium for commerce and communications  the continuing increase in the amount of data transmitted over communications networks and the growth of broadband communications networks to meet the increased demand for bandwidth 
if the internet does not continue to expand as a widespread communications medium and commercial marketplace  the need for significantly increased bandwidth across networks and the market for broadband communications equipment may not continue to develop 
future demand for our products is uncertain and will depend to a great degree on the continued growth and deployment of new broadband communications equipment 
if this growth does not continue  sales of our products may decline 
if we fail to accurately forecast component and material requirements for our manufacturing facilities  we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays 
we use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders to determine our component requirements 
it is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and materials 
lead times for components and materials that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as specific supplier requirements  the size of the order  contract terms and current market demand for the components 
for substantial increases in production levels  some suppliers may need six months or more lead time 
as a result  we may be required to make financial commitments in the form of purchase commitments 
we lack visibility into the finished goods inventories of our customers and the end users 
this lack of visibility impacts our ability to accurately forecast our requirements 
if we overestimate our component and material requirements  we may have excess inventory  which would increase our costs 
an additional risk for potential excess inventory results from our volume purchase orders with certain material suppliers  which can only be reduced in certain circumstances 
additionally  if we underestimate our component and material requirements  we may have inadequate inventory  which could interrupt our manufacturing and delay delivery of our products to our customers 
any of these occurrences would negatively impact our sales and profitability 
as we broaden our product lines we must purchase a wider variety of components to utilize in our manufacturing processes 
in addition  new product lines contain a greater degree of uncertainty due to a lack of visibility of customer acceptance and potential competition 
both of these factors will contribute a higher level of inventory risk in our near future 
we depend on single or limited source suppliers for some of the key components and materials in our products  which makes us susceptible to supply shortages or price fluctuations that could adversely affect our operating results 
we typically purchase our components and materials through purchase orders  and we have no guaranteed supply arrangements with any of our suppliers 
we currently purchase several key components and materials used in the manufacture of our products from single or limited source suppliers 
in the event one of our sole source suppliers is unable or unwilling to sell us material components  this could have a significant adverse effect on the company 
additionally  we may fail to obtain required components in a timely manner in the future 
we may also experience difficulty identifying alternative sources of supply for the components used in our products 
we would experience delays if we were required to test and evaluate products of potential alternative suppliers 
furthermore  financial or other difficulties faced by our suppliers or significant changes in demand for the components or materials they supply to us could limit the availability of those components or materials to us 
in addition  the majority of our semiconductor products are packaged in the philippines and hong kong 
political and economic instability and changes in governmental regulations in these areas as well as the united states could affect the ability of our overseas vendors to package our products 
any interruption or delay in the supply of our required components  materials or services  or our inability to obtain these components  materials or services from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time  could impair our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could cause customers to cancel orders 
we face intense competition  and  if we do not compete effectively in our markets  we will lose sales and have lower margins 
the market for fiber optic and wireless communications services is relatively new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive  and we expect competition to intensify further in the future 
many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater technical  financial  marketing  distribution and other resources than we have 
price competition is intense and the market prices and margins of products frequently decline after competitors begin making similar products 
in addition  we compete with the captive manufacturing operations of large communications original equipment manufacturers such as lucent technologies  marconi and nortel networks who are also our customers 
they may decide at any time to satisfy some or all of their product needs through their own in house sources 
a number of our competitors may have greater name recognition and market acceptance of their products and technologies 
furthermore  our competitors  or the competitors of our customers  may develop new technologies  enhancements of existing products or new products that offer superior price or performance features 
these new products or technologies could render obsolete our products or the systems of our customers into which our products are integrated 
we rely on the significant experience and specialized expertise of our senior management in the rf industry and must retain and attract qualified engineers and other highly skilled personnel in a highly competitive job environment to maintain and grow our business 
our performance is substantially dependent on the continued services and on the performance of our senior management and our highly qualified team of engineers  who have many years of experience and specialized expertise in our business 
our performance also depends on our ability to retain and motivate our other executive officers and key employees 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or of a number of our engineers could harm our ability to maintain and build our business 
we have no key man life insurance policies 
our future success also depends on our ability to identify  attract  hire  train  retain and motivate highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing and customer service personnel 
if we fail to attract  integrate and retain the necessary personnel  our ability to maintain and build our business could suffer significantly 
additionally  california state law can create unique difficulties for a california based company attempting to enforce covenants not to compete with employees which could be a factor in our future ability to retain key management and employees in a competitive environment 
we may pursue acquisitions and investments in new businesses  products or technologies that involve numerous risks  including the use of cash and diversion of management s attention 
in the future  we may make acquisitions of and investments in new businesses  products and technologies or we may acquire operations that expand our manufacturing capabilities 
if we identify an acquisition candidate  we may not be able to successfully negotiate or finance the acquisition 
even if we are successful  we may not be able to integrate the acquired businesses  products or technologies into our existing business and products 
as a result of the rapid pace of technological change in the communications industry  we may misgauge the long term potential of the acquired business or technology or the acquisition may not be complementary to our existing business 
furthermore  potential acquisitions and investments  whether or not consummated  may divert our management s attention and require considerable cash outlays at the expense of our existing operations 
in addition  to complete future acquisitions  we may issue equity securities  incur debt  assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write downs of acquired assets  which could affect our profitability 
our business is subject to the risks of product returns  product liability and product defects 
products as complex as ours frequently contain undetected errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
the occurrence of errors could result in product returns from and reduced product shipments to our customers 
in addition  any failure by our products to properly perform could result in claims against us by our customers 
such failure also could result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products or harm our reputation 
due to the recent introduction of some of our products  we have limited experience with the problems that could arise with these products 
our purchase agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
however  the limitation of liability provision contained in these agreements may not be effective as a result of federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions in the united states or other countries 
although we maintain million of insurance to protect against claims associated with the use of our products  our insurance coverage may not adequately cover all claims asserted against us 
in addition  even ultimately unsuccessful claims could result in costly litigation  divert our management s time and resources and damage our customer relationships 
we use a number of specialized technologies  some of which are patented  to design  develop and manufacture our products 
infringement of our intellectual property rights could hurt our competitive position  harm our reputation and cost us money 
we regard the protection of our copyrights  patents  service marks  trademarks  trade dress and trade secrets as critical to our future success and plan to rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret law  as well as on confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions  to protect our proprietary rights 
we seek patent protection for our unique developments in circuit designs  processes and algorithms 
adequate protection of our intellectual property rights may not be available in every country where our products and services are made available 
we intend  as a general policy  to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with all of our employees and contractors  as well as into nondisclosure agreements with parties with which we conduct business  to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information  however  we have not done so on a uniform basis 
as a result  we may not have adequate remedies to preserve our trade secrets or prevent third parties from using our technology without authorization 
we cannot assure you that all future employees  contractors and business partners will agree to these contracts  or that  even if agreed to  these contractual arrangements or the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will prove sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or to deter independent third party development of similar technologies 
if we are unable to execute these agreements or take other steps to prevent misappropriation of our technology or to deter independent development of similar technologies  our competitive position and reputation could suffer and we could be forced to make significant expenditures 
we regularly file patent applications with the us patent and trademark office and in selected foreign countries covering particular aspects of our technology and intend to prosecute such applications to the fullest extent of the law 
based upon our assessment of our current and future technology  we may decide to file additional patent applications in the future  and may decide to abandon current patent applications 
we cannot assure you that any patent application we have filed or will file will result in an issued patent  or  if patents are issued to us  that such patents will provide us with any competitive advantages and will not be challenged by third parties or invalidated by the us patent and trademark office or foreign patent office 
any failure to protect our existing patents or to secure new patents may limit our ability to protect the intellectual property rights that such patents or patent applications were intended to cover 
furthermore  the patents of others may impair our ability to do business 
see business intellectual property for a more complete description of our intellectual property and our efforts to protect it 
we have several registered trademarks and service marks  in the united states and abroad  and are in the process of registering others in the united states 
nevertheless  we cannot assure you that the us patent and trademark office will grant us these registrations 
should we decide to apply to register additional trademarks or service marks in foreign countries  there is no guarantee that we will be able to secure such registrations 
the inability to register or decision not to register in certain foreign countries and adequately protect our trademarks and service marks could harm our competitive position  harm our reputation and negatively impact our future profitability 
for more details  see business intellectual property 
claims that we are infringing third party intellectual property rights may result in costly litigation 
as a provider of technologically advanced products  we are at particular risk of becoming subject to litigation based on claims that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
in the past  we have been subject to claims that some of our products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties 
we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to any such claims in the future 
any future similar claims  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming to defend  damage our reputation  result in substantial and unanticipated costs associated with litigation and require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
the variability of our manufacturing yields may affect our gross margins 
the success of our business depends largely on our ability to produce our products efficiently through a manufacturing process that results in a large number of usable products or yields  from any particular production run 
in the past  we have experienced significant delays in our product shipments due to lower than expected production yields 
due to the rigid technical requirements for our products and manufacturing processes  our production yields may be negatively affected by a variety of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
for instance  yields may be reduced by impurities in materials used  contamination of the manufacturing environment  human error  in part  due to insufficient employee training  and equipment failures 
our manufacturing yields also vary significantly among our products due to product complexity and the depth of our experience in manufacturing a particular product 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience problems with our production yields in the future 
decreases in our yields can result in substantially higher costs for our products 
if we cannot maintain acceptable production yields in the future  our gross margin may suffer 
changes in the regulatory environment of the communications industry may reduce the demand for our products 
the recent deregulation of the telecommunications industry has resulted in an increased number of service providers 
such increase  coupled with the expanding use of the internet and data networking by businesses and consumers  has resulted in the rapid growth of the communications industry 
this has led and will likely continue to lead to intense competition  short product life cycles  and  to some extent  regulatory uncertainty in and outside the united states 
the course of the development of the communications industry is difficult to predict 
for example  the delays in governmental approval processes that our customers are subject to  such as the issuance of site permits and the auction of frequency spectrum  have in the past caused  and may in the future cause  the cancellation  postponement or rescheduling of the installation of communications systems by our customers 
a reduction in network infrastructure expenditures could negatively affect the sale of our products 
moreover  in the short term  deregulation may result in a delay or a reduction in the procurement cycle because of the general uncertainty involved with the transition period of businesses 
our future profitability could suffer from known or unknown liabilities that we retained when we sold parts of our company 
in the recent past  we completed the divestiture of all but our current business 
in the transactions in which we sold our other businesses  we generally retained liability arising from events occurring prior to the sale 
some of these liabilities were or have since become known to us  such as the environmental condition of the production facilities we sold 
we may have underestimated the scope of these liabilities  and we may become aware of additional liabilities associated with the following in the future ownership of the intellectual property we have sold  the potential infringement by our sold businesses of the intellectual property of others  the regulatory compliance of our sold defense business  export control compliance with respect to our defense products purchased by the united states and foreign governments  and product defect claims with respect to products manufactured by our sold businesses before they were sold 
if these and any other unknown liabilities and obligations exceed our expectations and established reserves  our future profitability could suffer and our capital needs could increase 
if we fail to comply with environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines 
two of our current and former production facilities have significant environmental liabilities for which we have entered into and funded fixed price remediation agreements and obtained cost overrun and unknown pollution insurance coverage 
we cannot assure you that this insurance will be sufficient to cover all liabilities related to these sites 
in addition  we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products 
in the past  we have been subject to periodic environmental reviews and audits  which have resulted in minor fines 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  substantial fines could be imposed on us  and we could be required to suspend production  alter manufacturing processes or cease operations 
if rf emissions pose a health risk  the demand for our products may decline 
recent news reports have asserted that some radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to various health concerns  including cancer  and may interfere with various electronic medical devices  including hearing aids and pacemakers 
if it were determined or perceived that rf emissions from wireless communications equipment create a health risk  the market for our wireless customers products and  consequently  the demand for our products could decline significantly 
our manufacturing facilities are concentrated in an area susceptible to earthquakes 
our headquarters and our manufacturing facilities are concentrated in an area where there is a risk of significant earthquake activity 
substantially all of the production equipment that currently accounts for our sales  as well as planned additional production equipment  is or will be located in a known earthquake zone 
we cannot predict the extent of the damage that our facilities and equipment would suffer in the event of an earthquake or how such damage would affect our business 
we do not maintain earthquake insurance 
our stock price is highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
since our initial public offering in august   through january   our common stock has traded at prices as low as and as high as per share 
these fluctuations have occurred and may continue to occur in response to various factors  many of which we cannot control  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors  customers or us  general conditions in the semiconductor industry and telecommunications and data communications equipment markets  changes in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by analysts  changes in investor perceptions  or changes in expectations relating to our products  plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers 
in addition  the market prices of securities on the nasdaq national market and that of our customers and competitors have been especially volatile 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been the subject of securities class action litigation 
if we were the object of a securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial losses and divert management s attention and resources from other matters 
our business experiences seasonality 
it has been our experience that telecommunication equipment spending is typically lower in the first quarter of the calendar year and higher during the fourth quarter of the calendar year 
this apparent seasonality may be even more pronounced in light of the current economic downturn 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future through the issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities or by borrowing money  and additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
we believe that the cash  cash equivalents and investments on hand  the cash we expect to generate from operations and borrowings under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital spending requirements at least through the end of however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to fund our activities during and or beyond that time 
we could raise these funds by selling more stock to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
in addition  even though we many not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations significantly or to obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies or potential markets 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
it is possible that our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including whether the company operates on a positive cash flow basis  the market acceptance of our products  the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace  volume price discounts  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and product and technology roadmaps  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  capital improvements to new and existing facilities  technological advances  our competitors response to our products  and our relationships with suppliers and customers 
in addition  we may require additional capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring  infrastructure and facility needs or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
our business operations may be effected by the california utility outages 
our headquarters and our manufacturing facilities are concentrated in the state of california  which experienced power shortages and outages earlier in substantially all of the production equipment that currently accounts for our sales  as well as planned additional production equipment  is or is currently expected to be located in california 
we cannot predict when these outages will occur and the extent these outages will disrupt our business operations and delay delivery of our products 
any delays in product deliveries could result in a loss of sales and a loss of customers which could impact our profitability 
our controlling stockholder has the ability to take action that may adversely affect our business  our stock price and our ability to raise capital 
as of december   fox paine company  llc fox paine is the indirect beneficial owner of of our outstanding share capital 
as a result  fox paine has and will continue to have control over the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval  including the power to elect all of our directors and the directors of our subsidiaries  amend our charter or by laws  and agree to or prevent mergers  consolidations or the sale of all or substantially all our assets or our subsidiaries assets 
fox paine also will be able to delay  prevent or cause a change in control relating to us 
fox paine s control over us and our subsidiaries  and its ability to delay or prevent a change in control relating to us could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  fox paine receives management fees from us which could influence their decisions regarding us 
fox paine may in the future make significant investments in other communications companies 
some of these companies may be our competitors 
fox paine and its affiliates are not obligated to advise us of any investment or business opportunities of which they are aware  and they are not restricted or prohibited from competing with us 
the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by fox paine or the perception that such sale could occur  could negatively affect the market price of our common stock and could also materially impair our future ability to raise capital through an offering of securities 
there are inherent risks associated with sales to our foreign customers 
we sell a significant portion of our product to customers outside of the united states 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of our sales in  and  respectively 
we expect that sales to customers outside of the united states will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales 
although all of our foreign sales are denominated in us dollars  such sales are subject to certain risks  including  among others  changes in regulatory requirements  the imposition of tariffs and other trade barriers  the existence of political  legal and economic instability in foreign markets  language and cultural barriers  seasonal reductions in business activities  our ability to receive timely payment and collect our accounts receivable  currency fluctuations  and potentially adverse tax consequences  which could adversely affect our business and financial results 
future sales of our common stock could depress its market price 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock by our officers  directors and other stockholders in the public  or the awareness that a large number of shares is available for sale  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition to the adverse effect a price decline would have on holders of our common stock  that decline would impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of common stock or other equity or convertible debt securities 
the amount and timing of revenue from newly designed products is often uncertain 
we have announced a significant number of new products and design wins for new and existing products 
achieving a design win with a customer does not create a binding commitment from that customer to purchase our products 
rather  a design win is solely an expression of interest by potential customers in purchasing our products and is not supported by binding commitments of any nature 
accordingly  a customer may choose at any time to discontinue using our products in their designs or product development efforts 
even if our products are chosen to be incorporated in our customer s products  we still may not realize significant revenues from that customer if their products are not commercially successful 
a design win may not generate revenue if the customer s product is rejected by their end market 
typically  most new products or design wins have very little impact on near term revenue 
it may take well over a year before a new product or design win generates meaningful revenue 
we must develop or otherwise gain access to improved process technologies 
for our semiconductor products  our future success will depend upon our ability to continue to improve existing process technologies  to develop or acquire new process technologies  and to adapt our process technologies to emerging industry standards 
in the future  we may be required to transition one or more of our products to process technologies with smaller geometries  other materials or higher speed in order to reduce costs and or improve product performance 
we may not be able to improve our process technologies and develop or otherwise gain access to new process technologies in a timely or affordable manner 
in addition  products based on these technologies may not achieve market acceptance 
recent events related to our independent auditor  arthur andersen 
on march  our independent certified public accountant  arthur andersen  llp  was indicted on federal charges of obstruction of justice in connection with the us government s investigation of enron 
we are required to file periodic financial statements with the sec which have been audited or reviewed by an independent  certified public accountant 
the sec has issued a release stating that it will continue to accept financial statements audited by arthur andersen  and interim financial statements reviewed by it  so long as arthur andersen is able to make certain representations to us 
while arthur andersen has made the sec required representations to us in connection with our audited financial statements for  there can be no assurance that arthur andersen will be able to do so in the future  that the sec will continue to accept financial statements audited or reviewed by arthur andersen or that arthur andersen will be able to perform the required services for us 
in such case  we will promptly seek to engage new independent certified public accountants to perform audit related services for us 
our ability to timely file our required periodic reports could be impaired if arthur andersen becomes unable to make the required representations to us  the sec ceases accepting financial statements audited or reviewed by arthur andersen or if for any other reason arthur andersen is unable to perform audit related services for us 
if we are unable to timely file our required periodic reports it could have a material adverse effect on us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
cash equivalents and investments cash and equivalents consist of municipal bond funds and commercial paper acquired with remaining maturity periods of days or less and are stated at cost plus accrued interest which approximates market value 
short term investments consist primarily of high grade debt securities a rating or better with maturity greater than days from the date of acquisition and are classified as available for sale 
short term investments classified as available for sale are reported at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of tax  until realized 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will rise or fall in value if market interest rates change 
they are also subject to short term market risk 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
the following table provides information about the company s investment portfolio and constitutes a forward looking statement 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
expected maturity dates expected maturity amounts in thousands weighted average interest rate cash equivalents short term investments fair value at december
