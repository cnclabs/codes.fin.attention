item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
business strengths we believe that the following strengths are critical to our success as a leading provider of security products  vehicle armor systems and security risk management services 
broad portfolio of products and services 
we offer a broad portfolio of security products  armor systems and security services which enables us to provide comprehensive solutions to our customers security needs 
we seek to strengthen our capabilities as a single source provider of global security services to our clients 
our worldwide infrastructure enables us to follow our governmental and multinational corporate clients to new geographical markets and cross sell additional services to these customers 
similarly  through our extensive product distribution network we can provide our customers a broad array of complementary  manufactured law enforcement equipment 
we expect to continue to expand our product and service offerings and further diversify our revenue base 
strong brands with leading market positions 
product lines are marketed under brand names widely recognized in the military and law enforcement communities  such as american body armor  nik r  defense technology  federal laboratories  mace r  safariland  monadnock  breakfree  lightning powder  identicator  o gara hess eisenhardt and others 
due to the life protecting nature of the products in the markets that we serve  end users prefer to purchase premium products with brand names that have solid reputations for quality and that provide high levels of performance 
the strength of our brand names has contributed to our leading market positions in several of the product categories in which we compete 
strong client base and extensive distribution network 
armor holdings products has a broad  full service network of approximately domestic distributors and international agents to sell our portfolio of manufactured law enforcement equipment 
the armor mobile security division s client base includes governmental and private buyers and employs a global sales force to market its commercial products 
armorgroup has a global footprint and currently operates in countries that enables it to serve a client base representing governmental and non governmental agencies and approximately multinational corporations worldwide 
the quality and scope of our products and the strength of our brand names have enabled us to establish one of the largest distribution networks in the industry and engendered the loyalty of our distributors 
we work closely with our distributors and agents to respond to and anticipate the needs of end users  allowing us to maintain our market leadership position 
the diversity of our clients end markets  the continued globalization of our clients and the strength of our distribution relationships minimize our dependence on any particular product  market  or customer 
proven track record of identifying  completing and integrating acquisitions 
since january  we have completed acquisitions 
we employ a disciplined approach to evaluating acquisition opportunities and integrating the operations of acquired businesses 
these acquisitions  in the aggregate  have strengthened our market position  leveraged our distribution network and expanded our product and service offerings 
our performance based compensation plan enables us to retain strong managers of acquired businesses and provides for timely and efficient integration of acquired operations 
sole source provider of up armored hmmwvs 
through our armor mobile security division  we are the sole source provider of up armored hmmwvs to the us military  as well as the armoring of the himars cab  a program currently in development for the us army 
contracted by the department of defense  the armor mobile security division which prior to august  was a division of the kroll o gara company delivered hmmwvs in and hmmwvs in this growth is driven by an increased defense budget for procurement  heightened demand due to recent military deployments and activation of us reserve and national guard units  and the potential of a long term  multi front offensive against terrorism 
aftermarket sales of spare parts and services maintenance are also extremely attractive  as we are the incumbent provider of the armoring on an installed base of over  up armored hmmwvs 
we believe our strength in this product segment is significant and should drive future growth 
growth strategy the demand for security products  vehicle armor systems  and security risk management services will continue to grow 
we will address this growth by offering a comprehensive array of premium security risk management products and services 
we will enhance our leadership position through strategic acquisitions by creating a broad portfolio of products and services to satisfy all of our customers increasingly complex security needs 
by establishing a critical mass of products and services and a broad base of customers  we have developed the capacity to perform multiple aspects of our clients threat analyses and security provisions on a comprehensive basis 
we will continue to execute this growth strategy primarily through internal expansion of our existing businesses and through strategic acquisitions of businesses offering complementary services  markets  and customer bases 
the following elements define our growth strategy capitalize on exposure to military programs 
the events of september   are likely to result in additional spending by the department of defense 
we expect several of our military programs may be positively affected 
these include the concealable body armor program through which we supply concealable body armor to the us army and the special operation forces personal equipment advance requirement spear program  which supplies special ballistic vests and load bearing equipment to us special forces 
we are the sole source provider to the us military for the supply of armor and blast protection to the hmmwvs 
we are well positioned on these programs and have a proven track record and a strong relationship with the us military 
additionally  we expect to participate in other existing and future military programs that require our unique products and services 
expand distribution network and product offerings 
we will continue to leverage our distribution network by expanding our range of branded law enforcement equipment through the acquisition of niche defensive security products manufacturers and by investing in the development of new and enhanced products which complement our existing offerings 
a broader product line will strengthen our relationships with distributors  and allow us to add additional quality distributors  enhancing our brand appeal with military  law enforcement and other end users 
capitalize on increased homeland security requirements 
we are well positioned to provide products  services and specialized training essential to establishing a sustainable homeland security infrastructure 
after the september  terrorist attacks on the united states  the us government has created the office of homeland security 
although this office s mandate is still being finalized  a homeland security infrastructure will be developed 
we believe that our three divisions are well equipped and prepared to help build this infrastructure 
our armor holdings products division is positioned to provide products that additional military  law enforcement  security and corrections personnel require to combat terrorism and threats to our homeland 
our armor mobile security division is prepared for an expected increase in armored commercial vehicles for use by federal  state and local government agencies 
the services provided by our services division are expected to be more sought after as us government agencies and corporations re evaluate their security programs 
for example  we expect to leverage our global experience and reputation into domestic airport security training 
increase global position in high fright areas 
we expect to service the heightened security concerns of governments  agencies and corporations in existing high fright areas and will leverage our global expertise and reputation for providing security products and services in newly developing high fright areas 
we target regions with economic and political instability as well as regions with increased regulation  growth in prison populations and growing national and regional security concerns 
we also grow the scope of our existing product and service offerings by servicing existing customers who expand geographically 
broaden service offerings to existing client base 
we expect to broaden our existing service offerings through strategic acquisitions and develop a comprehensive range of security risk management offerings with a global network of service providers 
we will continue to market expanded offerings  increasing penetration of our existing client base with sales of additional services 
pursue strategic acquisitions 
the security risk management products and services industry is highly fragmented and characterized primarily by smaller  geographically restricted single product or service providers 
we believe many clients in the industry would prefer to deal with a single entity that can provide a broad spectrum of services and or products in the security risk management industry covering their needs across entire regions  or globally 
we selectively pursue acquisitions that complement and expand our product and service offerings and provide access to new geographic markets  additional distribution channels and new client relationships 
acquisitions we have pursued a strategy of growth by acquiring businesses and assets that complement our existing operations 
we use several criteria to evaluate prospective acquisitions  including whether the business to be acquired o broadens the scope of the services or products we offer or the geographic areas we serve  o offers attractive margins  o is accretive to earnings  o offers opportunity to improve profitability by increasing the efficiency of our operations  o is managed in a manner consistent with our existing businesses  and o complements our portfolio of existing businesses by increasing our ability to manage our customers needs 
we exercise a high degree of financial discipline and strictly adhere to these criteria 
as a result  we do not enter into transactions that we believe would be dilutive to our earnings 
since january  we have consummated acquisitions 
the armor holdings products division has acquired companies since the largest acquisition completed by this division was safariland  a producer of law enforcement products such as body armor  duty gear  and automotive accessories in safariland had approximately million in annual revenues at the time of acquisition

commercial products 
we armor a variety of vehicles  including limousines  sedans  sport utility vehicles  commercial trucks and cash in transit vehicles  to protect against varying degrees of ballistic and blast threats 
the armoring process begins with the disassembly of a new base vehicle 
this disassembly normally involves the removal of the interior trim  seats  doors and windows

fully armored vehicles typically sell for  to  exclusive of the cost of the base vehicle 
fully armored vehicles also include parade cars  which are formal limousines used predominantly for official functions by a president or other head of state

magnum

private customers for armored commercial vehicles include corporations and individuals

our armor holdings products division manufactures and sells a broad range of high quality branded law enforcement equipment  such as tactical armor  hard armor  duty gear  less lethal munitions  anti riot products  police batons  forensic products and weapon maintenance products 
our products are marketed under brand names that are well known and respected in the military and law enforcement communities such as american body armor  safariland  defense technology  federal laboratories  mace r  protech  nik r public safety  break free  monadnock lifetime products  identicator and lightning powder 
we sell our manufactured products primarily to law enforcement agencies through a worldwide network of over distributors and sales agents  including approximately in the united states 
our extensive distribution capabilities and commitment to customer service and training have enabled us to become a leading provider of security equipment to law enforcement agencies 
armor mobile security 
our armor mobile security division  created upon the acquisition of o gara hess eisenhardt armoring company  the o gara comopany  and o gara security associates  inc on august   manufactures and installs ballistic and blast protected armoring systems for military vehicles  commercial vehicles  military aircraft and missile components 
under the brand name o gara hess eisenhardt  we are the sole source provider to the us military for the supply of armoring and blast protection systems for the high mobility multi purpose wheeled vehicle the hmmwv 
we have also entered into an agreement to provide the us military with certain maintenance services with respect to its hmmwvs 
there is currently an installed base of approximately  up armored hmmwvs subject to this maintenance arrangement 
we expect that our maintenance services may increase if the us military substantially increases its hmmwv purchases or substantially increases its use of the current installed base 
additionally  the armor mobile security division has been subcontracted to develop a ballistically armored and sealed truck cab for himars  a program currently in development for the us army  and also markets armor sub systems for other tactical wheeled vehicles 
we armor a variety of commercial vehicles  including limousines  sedans  sport utility vehicles  commercial trucks and cash in transit vehicles  to protect against varying degrees of ballistic and blast threats 
armorgroup

we believe that this creates a consistent demand for our premium services at attractive margins 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  the use of estimates  income taxes and impairment 
revenue recognition we record products revenue at the time of shipment 
returns are minimal and do not materially effect the financial statements 
we record revenue from our mobile security division when the vehicle is shipped  except for larger commercial contracts typically longer than four months in length and the contract for the delivery of hmmwvs to the us government which continues through revenue from such contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion  units of work performed method 
hmmwv units sold to the us government are considered complete when the onsite department of defense officer finishes the inspection of the hmmwv and approves it for delivery 
should such contracts be in a loss position  the entire estimated loss would be recognized for the balance of the contract at such time 
current contracts are profitable 
we record service revenue as services are provided on a contract by contract basis 
revenues from service contracts are recognized over the term of the contract 
estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the carrying value of long lived assets  valuation allowances for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  liabilities for potential litigation claims and settlements  and contract contingencies and obligations 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
income taxes we account for income taxes pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method specified thereunder  deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax liabilities are offset by deferred tax assets relating to net operating loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences 
future benefits obtained from utilization of net operating loss carryforwards or from the reduction in the income tax asset valuation allowance existing on september  have been and will be applied to reduce reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets 
at december  and  the company s consolidated foreign subsidiaries have unremitted earnings of approximately million and million  respectively on which the company has not recorded a provision for united states federal income taxes since these earnings are considered to be permanently invested 
such foreign earnings have been taxed according to the regulations existing in the countries in which they were earned 
impairment long lived assets including certain identifiable intangibles  and the goodwill related to those assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset in question may not be recoverable including  but not limited to  a deterioration of profits for a business segment that has long lived assets  and when other changes occur which might impair recovery of long lived assets 
management has reviewed the company s long lived assets and has determined that there are no events requiring impairment loss recognition at december  the method used to determine the existence of an impairment would be undiscounted operating cash flows estimated over the remaining amortization period for the related long lived assets 
impairment is measured as the difference between fair value and unamortized cost at the date impairment is determined

not including these acquisitions  the armor holdings product division revenue decreased during fiscal  due in part to shipping interruptions and order cancellations that resulted from the september terrorist attacks against the world trade center and the pentagon and to a slowdown in purchasing during the first quarter of the company associated the first quarter slowdown with the bulletproof vest partnership act the bvp money that provides federal matching funds to law enforcement agencies purchasing bullet resistant vests

forward looking statements we believe that it is important to communicate our expectations to our investors 
accordingly  this report contains discussion of events or results that have not yet occurred or been realized 
you can identify this type of discussion  which is often termed forward looking statements  by such words and phrases as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates and could be 
execution of acquisition strategies  expansion of product lines and increase of distribution networks or product sales are as  among others  whose future success may be difficult to predict 
you should read forward looking statements carefully because they discuss our future expectations  contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial position  or state other expectations of future performance 
the actions of current and potential new competitors  changes in technology  seasonality  business cycles and new regulatory requirements are factors that impact greatly upon strategies and expectations and are outside our direct control 
there may be events in the future that we are not able accurately to predict or to control 
any cautionary language in this report provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ from the expectations we express in our forward looking statements 
before you invest in our common stock  you should be aware that the occurrence of certain of the events described in this report could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial position 
inflation we believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation in recent years have not had a significant impact on our revenue or profitability 
historically  we have been able to offset any inflationary effects by either increasing prices or improving cost efficiencies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our global operating and financial activities  we are exposed to changes in raw material prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  we manage exposure to changes in raw material prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates through our regular operating and financing activities 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we utilize leveraged financial instruments or other derivatives 
market rate risk the following discussion about our market rate risk involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity security price risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to borrowings under our credit facilities and our short term monetary investments 
at december  we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
to the extent that  from time to time  the company holds short term money market instruments  there is a market rate risk for changes in interest rates on such instruments 
to that extent  there is inherent rollover risk in the short term money market instruments as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
however  there is no risk of loss of principal in the short term money market instruments  only a risk related to a potential reduction in future interest income 
derivative instruments are not presently used to adjust the our interest rate risk profile 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge this interest rate risk 
however  in the future  we may consider the use of financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the majority of our business is denominated in us dollars 
there are costs associated with our operations in foreign countries that require payments in the local currency 
where appropriate and to partially manage our foreign currency risk related to those payments we receive payment from customers in local currencies in amounts sufficient to meet our local currency obligations 
we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge foreign currency risk 
risks associated with international operations we do business in numerous countries  including emerging markets in africa  asia  south america  russia  and cis 
we have invested substantial resources outside of the united states and plan to continue to do so in the future 
our company s international operations are subject to the risk of new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions  tariffs and trade barriers  potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations  potential imposition of restrictions on investments  potentially adverse tax consequences  including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  and local economic  political and social conditions 
governments of many developing countries have exercised and continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector 
government actions in the future could have a significant adverse effect on economic conditions in a developing country or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on us and our operating companies 
we do not have political risk insurance in the countries in which we currently conducts business  but periodically analyze the need for and cost associated with this type of policy 
moreover  applicable agreements relating to the company s interests in our operating companies are frequently governed by foreign law 
as a result  in the event of a dispute  it may be difficult for the us to enforce our rights 
accordingly  we may have little or no recourse upon the occurrence of any of these developments
