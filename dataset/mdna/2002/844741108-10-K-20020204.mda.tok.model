item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year in review in  southwest posted a profit for the th consecutive year in one of the most challenging operating environments the air travel industry has ever faced 
during the year  southwest also increased our domestic market share  made enhancements that will improve our customer service  and ended the year with more employees and aircraft than we had when we began the year 
despite the onset of a recession early in and the september  terrorist attacks against the united states the terrorist attacks  southwest was profitable in each quarter of the year  including the third and fourth quarters after excluding federal grants recognized in these quarters under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act the act 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the terrorist attacks and the act 
although we were unable to match some of the company s record setting performance levels reached in  our business strategy primarily short haul  high frequency  low fare  point to point  high quality customer service continued to serve us well during some difficult times in in  we continued to maintain our cost advantage over our industry while the recession and events of september put downward pressure on revenues 
in response to uncertainties following september and the precipitous drop in demand for air travel  southwest amended its agreement with the boeing company to defer aircraft deliveries see note to the consolidated financial statements but did not ground airplanes  reduce service  or furlough employees 
following the temporary faa shutdown of us air space following the terrorist attacks  load factors have steadily improved to somewhat normal  average historical levels 
however  these load factors have resulted from significant fare discounting  which continues to result in year over year declines in passenger revenue yields per rpm passenger yields and operating revenue yields per asm 
as we begin  in addition to the difficult revenue environment for commercial airlines  the company is faced with increased war risk insurance and passenger security costs resulting from continually evolving security laws and directives 
in response to the terrorist attacks  the airline industry has worked diligently with congress  the dot  the faa  and law enforcement officials to enhance security 
during fourth quarter  the company was able to offset these additional costs because of lower jet fuel prices and through internal cost reduction initiatives implemented following the terrorist attacks 
however  there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to offset future cost increases resulting from the changing commercial airline environment 
the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement that involves uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
some significant factors include  but may not be limited to  additional laws or directives that could increase the company s costs or result in changes to the company s operations  etc 
during  we began service to two new cities  west palm beach  florida  and norfolk  virginia  while also discontinuing service to san francisco international airport due to airport congestion 
we have been pleased with the initial results in both of the new southwest cities 
prior to september  the company also continued to add flights between cities already served 
southwest ended serving cities in states 
immediately following the terrorist attacks  southwest suspended fleet growth 
however  by the end of the year  southwest had announced plans for modest growth to resume in early currently  available seat mile asm capacity is expected to grow approximately percent in with the planned net addition of at least aircraft 
the company will place in service at least new boeing s scheduled for delivery during the year and will retire three of the company s older s 
the immediately preceding sentences are forward looking statements that involve uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
some significant factors include  but may not be limited to  future capacity decisions made by the company  demand for air travel  changes in the company s aircraft retirement schedule  etc 
results of operations compared with the company s consolidated net income for was million 
per share  diluted  as compared to net income  before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  of million 
per share  diluted  a decrease of percent 
the prior years net income per share amounts have been restated for the three for two stock split see note to the consolidated financial statements 
consolidated results for included million in gains that the company recognized from grants under the act and special pre tax charges of approximately million arising from the terrorist attacks see note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the grant and special charges related to the terrorist attacks  net income for was million 
per share  diluted 
the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for was million  net of taxes of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net income and net income per share  diluted  after the cumulative change in accounting principle  for  were million and  respectively 
operating income for was million  a decrease of percent compared to following the terrorist attacks  all us commercial flight operations were suspended for approximately three days 
however  the company continued to incur nearly all of its normal operating expenses with the exception of certain direct trip related expenditures such as fuel  landing fees  etc the company cancelled approximately  flights before resuming flight operations on september  although we did not resume our normal pre september flight schedule until september  once the company did resume operations  load factors and passenger yields were severely impacted  and ticket refund activity increased 
the company estimates that from september through september  it incurred operating losses in excess of million 
the effects of the terrorist attacks continued to be felt throughout fourth quarter the company s operating income during fourth quarter was million  a decrease of percent compared to fourth quarter without consideration of any federal grant under the act the company expects to recognize in first quarter see note to the consolidated financial statements  it is not yet known whether the company will be profitable in first quarter  due to uncertain economic conditions and the difficult airline industry revenue environment 
operating revenues consolidated operating revenues decreased percent due primarily to a percent decrease in passenger revenues 
the decrease in passenger revenues was a direct result of the terrorist attacks 
because of the terrorist attacks  fluctuations in passenger revenue can best be explained by discussing the year in two distinct time periods january through august   and september through december  from january through august   passenger revenues were approximately percent higher than the same period in due primarily to an increase in capacity  as measured by asms  of percent 
the capacity increase was due to the addition of aircraft during all prior to september and was partially offset by a decrease of percent in passenger yield 
passenger yields decreased as a result of fare discounting by the company and the airline industry in general as the united states economy weakened throughout the year 
the company s load factor rpms divided by asms over this time period was percent  compared to percent for the same period in from september through december   passenger revenues were approximately percent lower than the same period of capacity increased percent and the company s load factor fell to percent  compared to percent during the same period of passenger yields were percent lower during this period versus the same period of due to aggressive fare sales following the terrorist attacks 
for the full year  the company experienced a percent increase in revenue passengers carried  a percent increase in revenue passenger miles rpms  and a percent increase in asms 
the company s load factor for was off points to percent and there was a percent decrease in passenger yield 
load factors in january continued to trail those experienced in january additionally  passenger yields remain significantly below prior year levels 
as a result  the company expects first quarter revenue per available seat mile to continue to fall below first quarter levels 
the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement  which involves uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
some significant factors include  but may not be limited to  additional incidents that could cause the public to question the safety and or efficiency of air travel  competitive pressure such as fare sales and capacity changes by other carriers  general economic conditions  operational disruptions as a result of bad weather  the impact of labor issues  and variations in advance booking trends 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company s revenue recognition policy 
as a result of weak economic conditions throughout  consolidated freight revenues decreased percent 
there were decreases in both the number of freight shipments and revenue per shipment 
following the september  terrorist attacks  the united states postal service made the decision to shift a portion of the mail that commercial carriers had previously carried to freight carriers 
as a result of this decision  the company expects to experience a decrease in freight revenues during at least the first half of when compared to the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement  which involves uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
some significant factors include  but may not be limited to  general economic conditions  subsequent shifts in business by the united states postal service  and capacity changes by other carriers 
other revenues increased percent due primarily to an increase in commissions earned from programs the company sponsors with certain business partners  such as the company sponsored first usa visa card 
operating expenses consolidated operating expenses for increased percent  compared to the percent increase in capacity 
operating expenses per asm decreased percent to  compared to 
in  due primarily to a decrease in average jet fuel prices

approximately percent of the increase in salaries  wages  and benefits per asm was due to increases in salaries and wages from higher average wage rates within certain workgroups and increased headcount due in part to the increased security requirements following the september terrorist attacks 
the remaining percent of the increase in salaries  wages  and benefits per asm was due to higher benefits costs  primarily health care costs 
the company s ramp  operations  and provisioning agents are subject to an agreement with the transport workers union of america  twu  which became amendable in december the company reached an agreement with the twu  which was ratified by its membership in june the new contract becomes amendable in june the company s mechanics are subject to an agreement with the international brotherhood of teamsters the teamsters  which became amendable in august southwest is currently in negotiations with the teamsters for a new contract 
the company s flight attendants are subject to an agreement with the twu  which becomes amendable in june the company s customer service and reservations agents are subject to an agreement with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers  which becomes amendable in november employee retirement plans expense per asm decreased percent  due primarily to the decrease in company earnings available for profitsharing 
the decrease in earnings more than offset an increase in expense due to a th quarter amendment made to the company s profitsharing plan 
this amendment enabled the company to take into consideration federal grants under the act and special charges resulting from the terrorist attacks in the calculation of profitsharing 
fuel and oil expense per asm decreased percent  due primarily to a percent decrease in the average jet fuel cost per gallon 
the average cost per gallon of jet fuel in was 
compared to 
in  including the effects of hedging activities 
the company s and average jet fuel prices are net of approximately million and million in gains from hedging activities  respectively 
the company s hedging gains were calculated according to the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 as amended sfas  which the company adopted january  see note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has hedges in place for approximately percent of its anticipated fuel consumption in considering current market prices and the continued effectiveness of the company s fuel hedges  we are forecasting our first quarter average fuel cost per gallon to be below first quarter s average fuel cost per gallon of 
the majority of the company s near term hedge positions are in the form of option contracts  which should enable the company to continue to benefit to a large extent from a decline in jet fuel prices 
the immediately preceding two sentences are forward looking statements  which involve uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
such uncertainties include  but may not be limited to  the largely unpredictable levels of jet fuel prices  the continued effectiveness of the company s fuel hedges  and changes in the company s overall fuel hedging strategy 
maintenance materials and repairs per asm decreased percent 
this decrease was due primarily to the company s capacity growth exceeding the increase in expense 
virtually all of the company s capacity growth versus the prior year was accomplished with new aircraft  most of which have not yet begun to incur any meaningful repair costs 
the decrease in engine expense was partially offset by an increase in expense for airframe inspections and repairs 
in addition to an increase in the number of airframe inspections and repairs  the cost per event increased compared to currently  the company expects an increase in maintenance materials and repairs expense per asm in first quarter versus first quarter the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement involving uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
such uncertainties include  but may not be limited to  any unscheduled required aircraft airframe or engine repairs and regulatory requirements 
agency commissions per asm decreased percent  due primarily to a change in the company s commission rate policy 
effective january   the company reduced the commission rate paid to travel agents from ten percent to eight percent for ticketless bookings  and from ten percent to five percent for paper ticket bookings 
effective october   the company reduced the commission paid to travel agents to five percent with no cap  regardless of the type of ticket sold 
due to this most recent commission policy change in october  we expect agency commissions to show a year over year decrease in first quarter on a per asm basis 
the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement involving uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
such uncertainties include  but may not be limited to  changes in consumer ticket purchasing habits 
aircraft rentals per asm decreased percent due primarily to a lower percentage of the aircraft fleet being leased 
approximately percent of the company s aircraft were under operating lease at december   compared to percent at december  based on the company s current new aircraft delivery schedule and scheduled aircraft retirements for  we expect a decline in aircraft rental expense per asm in the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement involving uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
such uncertainties include  but may not be limited to  changes in the company s current schedule for purchase and or retirement of aircraft 
landing fees and other rentals per asm increased percent primarily as a result of the company s expansion of facilities at several airports  including baltimore washington international airport and chicago midway airport 
as a result of the terrorist attacks  most other major airlines have reduced their flight schedules and or have retired aircraft early due to the decrease in demand for air travel 
since southwest has not reduced the number of flights it offers  the company expects that the airport costs it shares with other airlines on the basis of relative flights landed or passengers carried  such as landing fees and common space rentals  will increase on a per asm basis in future periods 
in fourth quarter  landing fees and other rentals per asm increased percent 
the company currently expects a similar year over year increase in first quarter the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement involving uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
such uncertainties include  but may not be limited to  changes in competitors flight schedules  demand for air travel  etc 
depreciation expense per asm increased percent due primarily to the growth in the company s aircraft fleet prior to the september  terrorist attacks 
the company had received delivery of new aircraft prior to september  bringing the percentage of owned aircraft in the company s fleet to percent by the end of compared to percent at the end of other operating expenses per asm increased percent due primarily to a significant increase in passenger liability  aircraft hull  and third party liability insurance costs following the terrorist attacks 
the company s insurance carriers cancelled their war risk and terrorism insurance policies following the terrorist attacks and reinstated such coverage at significantly higher rates than before 
although the company was reimbursed for a portion of the higher rates by the federal government for one month during fourth quarter  we have assumed no further reimbursements 
as a result  the company currently expects continued year over year increases in insurance costs for the near term future  including first quarter the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement involving uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
such uncertainties include  but may not be limited to  the financial stability of companies offering insurance policies to the airline industry  the level of competition within the insurance industry  etc 
other other expenses income included interest expense  capitalized interest  interest income  and other gains and losses 
interest expense was flat compared to the prior year 
following the terrorist attacks  the company borrowed the full million available under its revolving credit facility and issued million in long term debt in the form of pass through certificates see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in expense caused by these borrowings was offset by a decrease in interest rates on the company s floating rate debt and the july redemption of million of unsecured notes 
based on the company s recent borrowings  we expect interest expense to be higher on a year over year basis in first quarter the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement involving uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
such uncertainties include  but may not be limited to  subsequent financing decisions made by the company 
capitalized interest decreased percent primarily as a result of lower progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries compared to the lower progress payments were due in part to the deferral of boeing aircraft firm orders and options following the terrorist attacks 
interest income increased percent due primarily to higher invested cash balances  partially offset by lower rates of return 
other gains in resulted primarily from million received as the company s share of government grant funds under the act provided to offset the company s direct and incremental losses following the terrorist attacks  through the end of the company expects to receive up to an additional million in  but determined that due to some uncertainties regarding the amount to be received  accrual of any amounts in as a receivable was not proper 
the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement involving uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
such uncertainties include  but may not be limited to  subsequent modifications or amendments to the act  interpretations of the meaning of direct and incremental losses  and changes in the government s expected schedule of distributing grant funds  etc 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the act and grants from the government 
income taxes the provision for income taxes  as a percentage of income before taxes  decreased slightly to percent in from percent in the decrease resulted primarily from lower effective state tax rates in compared with the company s consolidated net income for before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was million 
per share  diluted  an increase of percent 
the cumulative change in accounting principle  related to the adoption of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 was million  net of taxes of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net income  after the cumulative change in accounting principle  was million 
net income per share  diluted  after consideration of the accounting change  was 
compared to 
in operating income was  million  an increase of percent compared to operating revenues consolidated operating revenues increased percent due primarily to a percent increase in passenger revenues 
the increase in passenger revenues primarily resulted from the company s increased capacity  strong demand for commercial air travel  and excellent marketing and revenue management 
the company experienced a percent increase in revenue passengers carried  a percent increase in rpms  and a percent increase in passenger yield 
the increase in passenger yield was due primarily to an percent increase in average passenger fare  partially offset by a percent increase in average length of passenger haul 
the increase in average passenger fare was due primarily to modest fare increases combined with a higher mix of full fare passengers 
the increase in rpms exceeded a percent increase in asms resulting in a load factor of percent  or points above the prior year 
the increase in asms resulted primarily from the net addition of aircraft during the year 
freight revenues increased percent due primarily to an increase in capacity 
other revenues  which consist primarily of charter revenues  increased percent 
this increase was less than the company s increase in capacity due primarily to the company s decision to utilize more of its aircraft to satisfy the strong demand for scheduled service and  therefore  make fewer aircraft available for charters 
operating expenses consolidated operating expenses for increased percent  compared to the percent increase in capacity 
operating expenses per asm increased percent to  compared to 
in  due primarily to an increase in average jet fuel prices 
the average fuel cost per gallon in was  which was the highest annual average fuel cost per gallon experienced by the company since excluding fuel expense  operating expenses per asm decreased percent 
salaries  wages  and benefits per asm increased slightly  as increases in productivity in several of the company s operational areas were more than offset by higher benefits costs  primarily workers compensation expense  and increases in average wage rates within certain workgroups 
employee retirement plans expense per asm increased percent  due primarily to the increase in company earnings available for profitsharing 
fuel and oil expense per asm increased percent  due primarily to a percent increase in the average jet fuel cost per gallon 
the average price per gallon of jet fuel in was 
compared to 
in  including the effects of hedging activities 
the company s and average jet fuel prices are net of approximately million and million in gains from hedging activities  respectively 
maintenance materials and repairs per asm decreased percent primarily because of a decrease in engine maintenance expense for the company s aircraft fleet as was an unusually high period for engine maintenance on these aircraft 
engine repairs for the company s aircraft are expensed on a time and materials basis 
these engine repairs represented approximately percent of the total decrease  while a decrease in airframe inspections and repairs per asm represented the majority of the remaining decrease 
the decrease in airframe inspections and repairs was due primarily to a greater amount of this work being performed internally versus  when a large portion of this type of work was outsourced 
therefore  in  a larger portion of the cost of these repairs was reflected in salaries and wages 
agency commissions per asm decreased percent  due primarily to a decrease in commissionable revenue 
approximately percent of the company s revenues were attributable to direct bookings through the company s internet site compared to approximately percent in the prior year 
the increase in internet revenues contributed to the company s percentage of commissionable revenues decreasing from percent in to percent in aircraft rentals decreased percent due primarily to a lower percentage of the aircraft fleet being leased 
approximately percent of the company s aircraft were under operating lease at december   compared to percent at december  landing fees and other rentals per asm decreased percent primarily as a result of a decrease in landing fees per asm of percent  partially offset by a slight increase in other rentals 
although landing fees declined on a per asm basis  they were basically flat on a per trip basis 
the growth in asms exceeded the trip growth due primarily to a percent increase in stage length the average distance per aircraft trip flown 
other operating expenses per asm decreased percent due primarily to company wide cost reduction efforts 
the company also reduced its advertising expense percent per asm  taking advantage of our national presence  increasing brand awareness  and strong customer demand 
other other expenses income included interest expense  capitalized interest  interest income  and other gains and losses 
interest expense increased percent due primarily to the company s issuance of million of long term debt in fourth quarter capitalized interest decreased percent primarily as a result of lower progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries compared to interest income increased percent due primarily to higher invested cash balances and higher rates of return 
other losses in resulted primarily from a write down associated with the consolidation of certain software development projects 
income taxes the provision for income taxes  as a percentage of income before taxes  decreased slightly to percent in from percent in liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was billion in compared to billion in the increase in operating cash flows was due primarily to the deferral of approximately million in tax payments until january  as provided for in the act  which more than offset the decrease in net income 
net cash provided by financing activities was billion in compared to a net use of million in financing cash flows were generated from borrowings the company made from its million revolving credit facility and the issuance of million in long term debt 
these borrowings were partially offset by the redemption of million unsecured notes in see note and note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these financing activities 
cash generated in was primarily used to finance aircraft related capital expenditures and provide working capital 
during  net capital expenditures were billion  which primarily related to the purchase of new aircraft delivered to the company  new aircraft the company has effectively purchased via a special purpose trust the trust  and progress payments for future aircraft deliveries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the trust 
the company s contractual commitments consist primarily of scheduled aircraft acquisitions 
as a result of the terrorist attacks  the company was able to modify its future aircraft delivery dates through the amendment of our purchase contract with the boeing company and through the creation of the trust 
through the trust  as of december   southwest will take delivery and place in service new aircraft in and eight new aircraft in excluding aircraft scheduled to be delivered from the trust  as of december   the company has no new aircraft deliveries scheduled for  in  in  in  in  in  and in the company also has a total of purchase options for new aircraft for years through and purchase rights for an additional s during in total  southwest s trust deliveries  firm orders  options  and purchase rights through are at aircraft 
the company has the option  which must be exercised two years prior to the contractual delivery date  to substitute s or s for the s 
the following table provides details regarding the company s contractual cash obligations subsequent to december  contractual cash obligations by year in millions beyond years total long term debt  short term borrowings operating lease commitments   aircraft purchase commitments  total contractual cash obligations        includes amounts classified as interest for capital lease obligations includes amounts payable to the trust see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has various options available to meet its capital and operating commitments  including cash on hand at december  of billion and internally generated funds 
in addition  the company will also consider various borrowing or leasing options to maximize earnings and supplement cash requirements 
the company believes it has access to a wide variety of financing arrangements because of its excellent credit ratings and modest leverage 
the company currently has outstanding shelf registrations for the issuance of million of public debt securities  which it may utilize for aircraft financings in and on september   the company announced its board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock 
repurchases are made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to time  depending on market conditions  and may be discontinued at any time 
as of december   in aggregate  million shares had been repurchased at a total cost of million  of which million was completed in no shares were repurchased in item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk southwest has interest rate risk in that it holds floating rate debt instruments and has commodity price risk in that it must purchase jet fuel to operate its aircraft fleet 
the company purchases jet fuel at prevailing market prices  but seeks to minimize its average jet fuel cost through execution of a documented hedging strategy 
southwest has market sensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and derivative instruments used to hedge its exposure to jet fuel price increases 
the company also operates aircraft under operating and capital leases 
however  leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and  therefore  are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below 
commitments related to leases are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information on the company s accounting for its hedging program and note to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the company s financial derivative instruments 
the fair values of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the company s jet fuel market price risk at december  were a net liability of approximately million  which is classified in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the fair values of the derivative instruments  depending on the type of instrument  were determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
an immediate ten percent increase or decrease in underlying fuel related commodity prices from the december  prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the commodity derivative instruments in place by approximately million 
changes in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well as related income tax effects 
this sensitivity analysis uses industry standard valuation models and holds all inputs constant at december  levels  except underlying futures prices 
airline operators are inherently capital intensive  as the vast majority of the company s assets are expensive aircraft  which are long lived 
the company s strategy is to capitalize conservatively and grow capacity steadily and profitably 
while the company uses financial leverage  it has maintained a strong balance sheet and an a credit rating on its senior unsecured fixed rate debt with standard poor s and fitch ratings agencies  and a baa or equivalent credit rating with moody s rating agency 
the company s aircraft secured notes and french credit agreements do not give rise to significant fair value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings are floating rate debt 
although there is interest rate risk associated with these secured borrowings  the risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the company may prepay this debt on any of the semi annual principal and interest payment dates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these borrowings 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company had outstanding senior unsecured notes totaling million at december  also  as disclosed in note  the company issued million in long term debt in november in the form of pass through certificates certificates  which are secured by aircraft the company owns 
the total of the company s long term unsecured notes represented only percent of total noncurrent assets at december  the unsecured long term debt currently has a weighted average maturity of years at fixed rates averaging percent at december   which is comparable to average rates prevailing over the last ten years 
the certificates bear interest at a combined weighted average rate of percent 
the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on its unsecured long term debt or its certificates because the interest rates are fixed and the financial leverage is modest 
the company also has some risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short term nature of its invested cash  which was billion at december  the company invests available cash in certificates of deposit and investment grade commercial paper that generally have maturities of three months or less  therefore  the returns earned on these investments parallel closely with floating interest rates 
the company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other material interest rate market risk management activities 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates as of december  would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt instruments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
a change in market interest rates could  however  have a corresponding effect on the company s earnings and cash flows associated with its aircraft secured notes  french credit agreements  and invested cash because of the floating rate nature of these items 
assuming floating market rates in effect as of december  were held constant throughout a twelve month period  a hypothetical ten percent change in those rates would correspondingly change the company s net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by approximately million 
however  a ten percent change in market rates would not impact the company s earnings or cash flow associated with the company s publicly traded fixed rate debt  or its certificates
