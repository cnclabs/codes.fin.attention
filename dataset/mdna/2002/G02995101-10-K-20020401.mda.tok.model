liquidity and capital resources the company historically has met its cash requirements and financed its growth principally through cash flows generated from operations 
during the past decade  the company has operated in a soft market cycle which was characterized by excess insurance capacity and declining insurance premium rates  however  commencing in fiscal year the company has operated in a hardening market with increased insurance premium rates for workers compensation and excess and surplus lines 
the company s primary sources of cash flow are proceeds from the sale or maturity of invested assets  premiums earned  investment income  income from real estate development sales commission income and management fees 
the company s short term cash requirements are primarily for claims payments  reinsurance premiums  commissions  salaries  employee benefits  real estate development expenses  and other operating expenses  and the purchase of investment securities  which have historically been satisfied from operating cash flows 
due to the uncertainty regarding settlement of unpaid claims  the long term liquidity requirements of the company may vary  and the company has attempted to structure its investment portfolio to take into account the historical payout patterns 
notwithstanding the company s dispute with one of its former reinsurers  berkley insurance company  as disclosed elsewhere in this report  management believes that the company s current cash flows are sufficient for the short term needs of its insurance business and the company s invested assets are sufficient for the long term needs of its insurance business 
the company also purchases reinsurance to mitigate the effect of large claims and to help stabilize demands on its liquidity 
on a consolidated basis  net cash provided from operations was million for  million for and million for the positive cash flows for said periods were primarily attributable to net premiums written  income from real estate development sales and net earnings 
because workers compensation and general liability claims may be reported over an extended period of time  the company has established loss reserves for such lines of business 
the assets supporting the company s reserves continue to earn investment income until claim payments are made

american safety s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders will depend  to a significant degree  on the ability of the company s subsidiaries to generate earnings from which to pay dividends to american safety 
the jurisdictions in which american safety and its insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled place limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance companies in order to protect the solvency of insurers 
harbour village development 
the company announced in march its plans to complete development of the harbour village golf and yacht club harbour village  located in ponce inlet  florida  consisting of residential condominium units  a marina containing boat slips  a par golf course and beach club 
the harbour village property comprising acres was acquired by the company through foreclosure in april  and has been under development by its subsidiary  ponce lighthouse properties  inc and its contracting subsidiary  rivermar contracting company 
the number of residential condominium units planned for the project has been increased from to as of february   the company s marketing efforts had generated approximately million of pre sales of condominium units and boat slips 
management anticipates that harbour village will be developed in three phases through  depending on future sales activities and economic conditions that may impact the marketing of the condominium units 
in july  the company initially closed a million acquisition  development and construction loan facility in order to commence construction of phase i of the project  which loan facility was increased in july through december   the company had outstanding borrowings of approximately million from this loan facility 
the estimated construction and development cost for the entire harbour village project is approximately million 
phase i of the development currently under construction consists of site work including a boat slip marina  residential units  and related amenities 
no assurance can be given  however  as to either future sales activities of the condominium units or the impact of local and national economic conditions on the company s marketing efforts for the development of the harbour village project 
management believes that the bank loan facility  together with anticipated cash flows from marketing and sales operations  will meet the liquidity needs for the construction and development of phase i of the harbour village project during the first months of development 
there can be no assurance  however  that the amounts available from the company s sources of liquidity  exclusive of the bank loan facility for the project  will be sufficient or available to meet the company s future capital needs for the project 
see exhibit for further information regarding harbour village 
critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are those the company considers critical in preparing its financial statements 
these policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made 
however  as described below  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
the descriptions below are summarized and have been simplified for clarity 
a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies used by the company in preparing its financial statements is included in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
reinsurance 
one of the company s former reinsurers  berkley insurance company  has disputed its obligations under several reinsurance treaties entered into during the soft reinsurance market that existed in and as of december   unreimbursed paid claims totaled million and additional ceded case and incurred but not reported reserves totals approximately million 
a reserve for this dispute has not been established since the company does not believe it is probable a loss will occur nor is any potential loss estimatable 
if any of these factors change in the future  the company will establish a reserve at that time  which could be material 
unpaid losses amp  loss adjustment expenses 
the company is required to estimate its liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses 
the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recorded on the company s balance sheet at the end of any given period should be adequate to cover all future payments required to be made on account of insured events that occurred on or before the balance sheet date 
however  because the future cannot be predicted with certainty  the actual future payments are usually different from the previously recorded estimates  and sometimes the differences may be material 
these differences are included in the company s results of operations in the future periods in which they become known 
deferred income taxes 
the company is required to establish a valuation allowance for the portion of any deferred tax asset  which amounted to million at december   that management believes will not be realized 
the company believes that it is more likely than not that the company will realize the full benefit of its deferred tax assets in future periods 
accordingly  no valuation allowance has been established 
construction accounting 
the company recognizes revenue on harbour village  its real estate development project  when title to each condominium unit and boat slip transfers to the purchaser 
when title transfers  the company uses a percentage of completion method based on actual costs to total estimated costs including allocated common costs to recognize revenue 
the estimated future common costs of amenities at december  were million  of which  related to condominium units that were closed in the percentage of completion method is based upon future estimated costs  and actual costs may vary greatly from these estimated costs requiring an adjustment to be recorded in future periods 
income taxes american safety is incorporated under the laws of bermuda and  under current bermuda law  is not obligated to pay any taxes in bermuda based upon income or capital gains 
american safety has received an undertaking from the minister of finance in bermuda pursuant to the provisions of the exempted undertakings tax protection act  which exempts american safety and its shareholders  other than shareholders ordinarily resident in bermuda  from any bermuda taxes computed on profits  income or any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate  duty or inheritance until march  the company  exclusive of its united states subsidiaries  does not consider itself to be engaged in a trade or business in the united states and accordingly does not expect to be subject to direct united states income taxation 
the company s us subsidiaries are subject to taxation in the united states 
impact of inflation property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amounts of losses and loss adjustment expenses are known and therefore before the extent by which inflation may affect such expenses is known 
consequently  the company attempts  in establishing its premiums  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation 
however  for competitive and regulatory reasons  the company may be limited in raising its premiums consistent with anticipated inflation  in which event the company  rather than its insureds  would absorb inflation costs 
inflation also affects the rate of investment return on the combined ratio the combined ratio of an insurance company measures only the underwriting results of insurance operations and not the profitability of the overall company 
the company s reported combined ratio for its insurance operations may not provide an accurate indication of the company s overall profitability from insurance and reinsurance programs due to the exclusion of fee and commission income and expenses generated in related management and agency subsidiaries 
depending on the company s mix of business going forward  the combined ratio may fluctuate from time to time and may not reflect the overall profitability of insurance programs to the company 
reserves certain of the company s insurance policies and reinsurance assumed  including general and pollution liability policies covering environmental remediation  excess and surplus  and workers compensation risks  may be subject to claims brought years after an incident has occurred or the policy period has ended 
the company is required to maintain reserves to cover its estimated liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred 
the company engages an independent internationally recognized actuarial consulting firm to provide reserve studies  rate studies  and opinions 
reserves are estimates at a given time  which are established from actuarial and statistical projections by the company of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims occurring on or prior to such time  including claims that have not yet been reported to the insurer 
the establishment of appropriate loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process  and there can be no assurance that the ultimate payments will not materially exceed the company s reserves
