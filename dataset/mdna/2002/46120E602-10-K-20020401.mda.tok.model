item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
except for historical information  the discussion in this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as applying to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in factors affecting operating results below as well as those discussed elsewhere 
overview we design  manufacture  and market the da vinci surgical system  an advanced surgical system that we believe represents a new generation of surgery 
the da vinci surgical system consists of a surgeon s console  a patient side cart  a high performance vision system and proprietary instruments 
the da vinci surgical system seamlessly translates the surgeon s natural hand movements on instrument controls at a console into corresponding micro movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions  or ports 
we believe that the da vinci surgical system is the only commercially available technology that can provide the surgeon with the intuitive control  range of motion  fine tissue manipulation capability and d visualization characteristic of open surgery  while simultaneously allowing the surgeon to work through the small ports of minimally invasive surgery or mis 
by placing computer enhanced technology between the surgeon and the patient  we believe that the da vinci surgical system enables surgeons to perform better surgery while giving patients the benefits of mis surgery  including decreased trauma and postoperative pain  reduced surgical complications  shorter hospital stays and lower total treatment costs 
in  we obtained permission from the european union to affix the ce mark to the da vinci surgical system and endowrist instruments for general surgical and cardiac surgical use 
based on this approval  we recognized revenue for the first time in the second quarter of for the sale of our products 
in july  we received clearance from the us food and drug administration  the fda  to begin commercialization of our da vinci surgical system in the united states for use in laparoscopic surgical procedures 
in march  we received clearance from the fda for use of our da vinci surgical system in non cardiac thoracoscopic surgical procedures 
in may  we received market clearance from the fda to promote use of the da vinci surgical system for performance of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy procedures 
to date  the majority of our revenues have come from the sales of the da vinci surgical system  which are high revenue dollar items 
a smaller percentage of revenues have come from sales of endowrist instruments and accessories  which are lower revenue dollar items 
a small percentage of revenue also comes from ongoing service of installed da vinci surgical systems 
although we expect the majority of our revenues to continue to come from the sale of da vinci surgical systems over the next few years  the percentage of revenue from our endowrist instruments and service should continue to increase 
due to the high dollar revenue per system sold  small variations in system unit sales may cause revenue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
during the useful life of each installed da vinci surgical system  we expect to generate recurring revenue through sales of the endowrist instruments and accessories and ongoing service 
results of operations sales 
sales for the fiscal year ended december  were million  up from million for the fiscal year ended december  the sales increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of da vinci surgical systems sold to in from in fiscal year sales were up million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended december  the sales increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of da vinci surgical systems sold to in from in gross profit 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended december  was million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales in the previous fiscal year 
the improvement in gross profit compared to the prior year resulted from sales growth and increased manufacturing efficiencies 
fiscal year and gross profit were both negatively impacted by a million non routine royalty charge that became due to ibm when intuitive surgical exceeded million in annual revenue in and million in excluding the impact of this charge  fiscal year gross profit would have been million  or of sales  and fiscal year gross profit would have been million or of sales 
the royalty payment represents the final royalty obligation under our agreement with ibm 
fiscal year gross profit was  or 
fiscal year was the first year in which revenue was recognized 
research and development expenses 
fiscal year research and development costs were million  up from million in fiscal year the increase was due to headcount increases and higher prototype material costs 
fiscal year research and development expenses of million were up from million in the increase was primarily due to headcount increases  offset by a decrease caused by classifying manufacturing costs as cost of sales instead of research and development beginning in the second quarter of  as sales were recorded for the first time  and lower fiscal year prototype materials costs 
research and development expenses include costs associated with the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
these enhancements represent significant improvements to our products 
research and development expenses also include expenditures for clinical trials and purchases of laboratory supplies 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the future 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year were million  up from million for fiscal year the year over year increase was due in large part to increases in headcount in the field service and sales functions to support increased revenue and a larger installed base of da vinci surgical systems 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year were million higher than fiscal expenses of million 
this increase was primarily due to headcount increases resulting from growing sales and marketing activities as the da vinci surgical system received us fda clearance in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for sales  marketing and administrative personnel  tradeshow expenses  legal expenses  regulatory fees and general corporate expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in the future to support our expanding business 
deferred compensation 
we record deferred compensation as the difference between the exercise price of options granted and the fair value of our common stock at the time of grant for financial reporting purposes 
deferred compensation is amortized to research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses 
for the years ended december   and  the company recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of million  million and  respectively 
for fiscal years  and non cash deferred compensation expense included in research and development expenses was million  million and  respectively 
for fiscal years  and non cash deferred compensation expense included in selling  general and administrative expenses was   and  respectively 
deferred compensation recorded through december  was million with accumulated amortization of million 
the remaining  will be amortized over the remaining vesting periods of the options  generally four years from the date of grant  using a graded vesting method 
future amortization of deferred compensation at december  is as follows  and  the amount of deferred compensation expense to be recorded in future periods may decrease if unvested options for which deferred compensation has been recorded are subsequently canceled 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million in fiscal the decrease resulted primarily from lower interest rates earned on cash and short term investment balances in fiscal year interest income was higher than fiscal year resulting from higher cash and short term investment balances  driven by the exercise of warrants to purchase preferred stock in march  yielding approximately million in net proceeds  and our initial public offering in june and july  which raised net proceeds of approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources prior to our initial public offering  operations were financed primarily through sales of our preferred stock  yielding net proceeds of approximately million  and equipment financing arrangements yielding approximately million 
in june and july  we completed the initial public offering of  shares of our common stock and realized net proceeds of approximately million 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  compared to million at december  and million at december  working capital at december  was million  compared to million at december  and million at december  the fiscal year decrease in cash and investments and working capital was primarily attributable to cash used to fund operating losses and to acquire fixed assets 
the fiscal year increase in cash and investments and working capital was primarily due to proceeds from issuance of preferred stock of million and initial public offering proceeds of million  offset by cash used to fund operating losses 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended december   compared to million for the fiscal year ended december  and for the fiscal year ended december  the increase in cash used in operations during compared to reflects higher working capital requirements in  primarily caused by the growth in the company s receivable balances 
the accounts payable and other accrued liabilities remained relatively flat 
the decrease in cash used in operations in compared to resulted primarily from a lower net loss for after adjusting for non cash charges for depreciation and deferred compensation 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended december   compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in and million used in fiscal year cash provided resulted from the net conversion of short term investments into cash to support operations 
the increase in cash used in investing activities between and is related to the purchase of short term investments with the net proceeds from our initial public offering in june and july and from the exercise of warrants to purchase preferred stock in march net cash provided by financing activities was  for the fiscal year ended december   compared to million for and million for fiscal year cash provided by financing resulted from proceeds from the issuance of common stock resulting mainly from the employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options for million  offset by the net repayment of long term equipment financing debt of million 
cash provided by investing activities in fiscal related primarily to our initial public offering in june and july  yielding net proceeds of million 
proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock were million and million in and  respectively 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products and other factors 
we expect to devote substantial capital resources to continue our research and development efforts  to expand our customer support and product development activities and for other general corporate activities 
we believe that our current cash and short term investment balances  together with revenue to be derived from the sale of our products  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements at least through during or after this period  if cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit arrangements 
additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the following table summarizes all significant contractual payment obligations by payment due date payments by period millions contractual obligation total under year years over years long term debt non routine royalty building lease total critical accounting policies the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
in certain cases  revenue from direct system sales is generated from multiple element arrangements which require judgement in the areas of delivery  customer acceptance  installation and collectibility 
revenue is recognized as specific elements indicated in sales contracts are executed 
if an element is essential to the functionality of the system  revenue is deferred until that essential element is delivered 
the fair value of each undelivered element that is not essential to the functionality of the system is deferred until performance occurs 
the fair value of an undelivered element is based upon an estimate made by management 
amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet 
warranties 
we provide for the estimated costs of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the company s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based upon historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
should warranty claim activity and the costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon management estimates 
factors underlying these estimates include analysis of days outstanding  customer payment history and management judgement 
the allowance is adjusted regularly to reflect current data and activity 
inventory reserves 
we write our inventory down for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
intangible assets 
we have intangible assets on our balance sheet related to the acquisition of patents 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful amortization lives involves judgments and the use of estimates 
the testing of these intangibles for impairment under established accounting guidelines is required on an ongoing basis 
changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to asset valuations 
contingencies 
we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to our products  patents and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
a complete description of all significant accounting policies is included in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  in item of this annual report on form k 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
we adopted sfas effective january  this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the adoption of sfas  as amended  has not had a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   and that the use of the pooling of interest method is no longer allowed 
under sfas no 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to an annual impairment test in accordance with the new standards 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their respective useful lives 
the company will adopt sfas no 
and sfas no 
as of january  the company does not currently believe that the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
will have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas the company will adopt sfas no 
as of january  the company does not currently believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations 
factors affecting operating results our future operating results may be below securities analysts or investors expectations  which could cause our stock price to decline 
because of our limited operating history  we have limited insight into trends that may emerge in our market and affect our business 
the revenue and income potential of our market are unproven  and we may be unable to generate significant commercial revenues 
in addition  our costs may be higher than we  securities analysts or investors expect 
if we fail to generate sufficient revenues or our costs are higher than we expect  our results of operations will suffer  which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 
further  future revenue from sales of our products  if any  will be difficult to forecast because the market for new surgical technologies is still evolving 
our results of operations will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress and results of clinical trials  actions relating to regulatory matters  the extent to which our products gain market acceptance  our timing and ability to develop our manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities  demand for our products  the progress of surgical training in the use of our products  our ability to develop  introduce and market new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis  product quality problems  our ability to protect our proprietary rights  our ability to license additional intellectual property rights  and third party payor reimbursement policies 
our operating results in any particular period will not be a reliable indication of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarters  our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock  and the value of your investment  will likely decline 
we have a large accumulated deficit  we expect future losses  and we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we have incurred substantial losses since inception and we expect to incur substantial additional operating losses for at least the next two years  primarily as a result of expected increases in expenses for our manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities  research and development activities  clinical trials and regulatory approval applications 
the extent of our future losses and the timing of profitability are highly uncertain  and we may never achieve profitable operations 
if the time required to generate significant revenues and achieve profitability is longer than anticipated  we may not be able to continue our operations 
our net loss for the year ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we experience long and variable sales cycles  which could have a negative impact on our results of operations for any given quarter 
our da vinci surgical system has a lengthy sales and purchase order cycle because it is a major capital item and generally requires the approval of senior management at purchasing institutions 
these factors may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  particularly during the periods in which our sales volume is low 
because of these fluctuations  it is likely that in some future quarters  our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if that happens  the market price of our stock would likely decrease 
these fluctuations also mean that you will not be able to rely upon our operating results in any particular period as an indication of future performance 
because a small number of customers have and are likely to continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues  our revenues could decline due to the loss or delay of a single customer order 
a relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of our total revenues 
in   and  the majority of our revenues came from the sales of da vinci surgical systems  which are high revenue dollar items 
due to the high dollar revenue per system sold  small variations in system unit sales may cause revenue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
for the year ended december   two customers  ab medica srl  located in italy  and marubeni america corporation  located in new york  each accounted for of our total sales 
ab medica srl and marubeni america corporation are our italian and japanese distributors  respectively 
for the year ended december   none of our customers accounted for or greater of total sales 
for the year ended december  ab medica srl accounted for of total sales 
we expect that revenues from a limited number of new customers will account for a large percentage of total revenues in future quarters 
our ability to attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors  including the capability  safety  efficacy  ease of use  price  quality and reliability of our products and effective sales  support  training and service 
the loss or delay of individual orders could have a significant impact on revenues and operating results 
our failure to add new customers that make significant purchases of our products would reduce our future revenues 
if our products do not achieve market acceptance  we will not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business 
our products represent a fundamentally new way of performing surgery 
achieving physician  patient and third party payor acceptance of intuitive surgery as a preferred method of performing surgery will be crucial to our success 
if our products fail to achieve market acceptance  hospitals will not purchase our products and we will not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business 
we believe that physicians and third party payors acceptance of the benefits of procedures performed using our products will be essential for acceptance of our products by patients 
physicians will not recommend the use of our products unless we can demonstrate that they produce results comparable or superior to existing surgical techniques 
even if we can prove the effectiveness of our products through clinical trials  surgeons may elect not to use our products for any number of other reasons 
for example  cardiologists may continue to recommend conventional open heart surgery simply because such surgery is already so widely accepted 
in addition  surgeons may be slow to adopt our products because of the perceived liability risks arising from the use of new products and the uncertainty of reimbursement from third party payors 
we expect that there will be a learning process involved for surgical teams to become proficient in the use of our products 
broad use of our products will require training of surgical teams 
market acceptance could be delayed by the time required to complete this training 
we may not be able to rapidly train surgical teams in numbers sufficient to generate adequate demand for our products 
although we are in the process of developing training programs for surgical teams  we cannot be certain that our training programs will be cost effective or sufficient to meet our customers needs 
we are involved in intellectual property litigation with computer motion and brookhill wilk  llc that may hurt our competitive position  may be costly to us and may prevent us from selling our products 
on may   computer motion  inc filed a lawsuit in united states district court for the central district of california case no 
cv cbm alleging that by making  using  selling or offering for sale our da vinci surgical system  we are infringing united states patent numbers       and  in willful disregard of computer motion s patent rights 
on june   computer motion amended its lawsuit to allege that we also infringe us patent number  on october   computer motion filed a motion seeking to add us patent number  to the litigation 
these patents concern methods and devices for conducting various aspects of robotic surgery 
on december and   the us patent and trademark office pto declared three interferences between a single sri patent application exclusively licensed to us and three of computer motion s patents  numbers   and  in light of those declarations of interference  the district court in february stayed put on hold all proceedings in the litigation for one year while the pto conducts the interference proceedings 
in february  the district court extended the stay through a late march status conference  at which time the parties and the court will discuss the propriety of further extending the stay in light of the ongoing interferences 
in connection with our joint litigation with ibm corporation against computer motion in delaware  computer motion has alleged infringement of its us patent no 
 although the delaware court refused to allow computer motion to sue us on this patent in delaware  computer motion may attempt to assert this patent against us in california if the california litigation continues 
if the california litigation proceeds notwithstanding the interferences  and if we ultimately lose computer motion s suit against us  it will hurt our competitive position  may be costly to us and may prevent us from selling our products 
in addition  if we lose the patent suit  we will need to obtain from computer motion a license to this technology if we are to continue to market our products that have been found to infringe computer motion s patents 
this license could be expensive  or could require us to license to computer motion some of our technology which would result in a partial loss of our competitive advantage in the marketplace  each of which could seriously harm our business 
if computer motion is successful in its suit against us and is unwilling to grant us a license  we will be required to stop selling our products that are found to infringe computer motion s patents unless we can redesign them so they do not infringe computer motion s patents  which we may be unable to do 
in addition  if we lose the patent suit  we could be required to pay computer motion damages  including treble damages  which could be substantial and harm our financial position 
on september   brookhill wilk  llc wilk filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york case no 
civ 
nrb alleging that by making  using  selling or offering for sale our da vinci surgical system  we are infringing us patent nos 
 and  in willful disregard of wilk s patent rights 
these patents concern methods and devices for remote surgery 
in march  wilk withdrew its assertion of the patent against intuitive 
on november   the district court granted summary judgment of noninfringement of the patent in our favor and dismissed wilk s complaint in its entirety without prejudice 
wilk has since filed a notice with the us court of appeals for the federal circuit to appeal the summary judgment ruling 
briefing on the appeal should conclude in mid  with a hearing date possible towards the end of or in early if we lose on appeal and ultimately also lose wilk s suit against us  it will hurt our competitive position  may be costly to us and may prevent us from selling our products 
if we lose the patent suit  we may need to obtain from wilk a license to this technology if we are to continue to market our products that have been found to infringe wilk s patents 
this license could be expensive  which could seriously harm our business 
if wilk is successful in its suit against us and is unwilling to grant us a license  we may be required to stop selling our products that are found to infringe wilk s patents unless we can redesign them so they do not infringe wilk s patents  which we may be unable to do 
in addition  if we lose the patent suit  we could be required to pay wilk damages  including treble damages  which could be substantial and harm our financial position 
the foregoing proceedings  will be expensive to litigate  may be protracted and our confidential information may be compromised 
whether or not we are successful in this lawsuit  these proceedings could consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources 
at any time computer motion or wilk may file additional claims against intuitive surgical  or we may file claims against computer motion or wilk  which could increase the risk  expense and duration of the litigations 
further  because of the substantial amount of discovery often involved in connection with this type of litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure 
for more information on our litigation with computer motion  see item business legal proceedings 
if we are unable to protect the intellectual property contained in our products from use by third parties  our ability to compete in the market will be harmed 
our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining patent and other intellectual property protection for the technologies contained in our products  and on successfully defending our patents and other intellectual property against third party challenges 
we will incur substantial costs in obtaining patents and  if necessary  defending our proprietary rights 
the patent positions of medical device companies  including ours  can be highly uncertain and involve complex and evolving legal and factual questions 
we cannot assure you that we will obtain the patent protection we seek  or that the protection we do obtain will be found valid and enforceable if challenged 
we also cannot assure you that we will be able to develop additional patentable proprietary technologies 
if we fail to obtain adequate protection of our intellectual property  or if any protection we obtain is reduced or eliminated  others could use our intellectual property without compensating us  resulting in harm to our business 
we may also determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily challenge a third party s products or patents in litigation or administrative proceedings  including patent interferences or reexaminations 
given the early priority dates of some of our licensed patents  we believe one or more patent proceedings may be in our best interests 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
others may assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights  which may cause us to engage in costly disputes and  if we are not successful in defending ourselves  could also cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products 
we are aware of both united states and foreign patents issued to third parties that relate to computer assisted surgery and minimally invasive surgery 
some of these patents on their face appear broad enough to cover one or more aspects of our present technology  and may cover aspects of our future technology 
we do not know whether any of these patents  if challenged  would be held valid  enforceable and infringed 
from time to time  we receive  and likely will continue to receive  letters from third parties inviting us to license their patents 
we may be sued by  or become involved in an administrative proceeding because of one or more of these third parties  regardless of the merits or likely outcome of such suit or proceeding 
we cannot assure you that a court or administrative body would agree with any arguments or defenses we have concerning invalidity  unenforceability or noninfringement of any third party patent 
in addition to the issued patents of which we are aware  other parties may have filed  and in the future are likely to file  patent applications covering surgical products that are similar or identical to ours 
we cannot assure you that any patents issuing from applications filed by a third party will not cover our products or will not have priority over our patent applications 
the medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation and administrative proceedings regarding patents and other intellectual property rights  and companies have employed such actions to gain a competitive advantage 
if third parties assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us as computer motion and brookhill wilk  llc have done  our technical and management personnel will experience a significant diversion of time and effort and we will incur large expenses defending ourselves 
if third parties in any patent action are successful  our patent portfolio may be damaged  we may have to pay substantial damages  including treble damages  and we may be required to stop selling our products or obtain a license which  if available at all  may require us to pay substantial royalties 
we cannot be certain that we will have the financial resources or the substantive arguments to defend our patents from infringement or claims of invalidity or unenforceability  or to defend against allegations of infringement of third party patents 
in addition  any public announcements related to litigation or administrative proceedings initiated by us  or initiated or threatened against us  could cause our stock price to decline 
the rights and measures we rely on to protect the intellectual property underlying our products may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our technology which could harm our ability to compete in the market 
in addition to patents  we typically rely on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical security measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
nevertheless  these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products 
if they do not protect our rights adequately  third parties could use our technology  and our ability to compete in the market would be reduced 
in addition  employees  consultants and others who participate in developing our products may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property  and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach 
we also may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries 
for a variety of reasons  we may decide not to file for patent  copyright or trademark protection outside the united states 
we also realize that our trade secrets may become known through other means not currently foreseen by us 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property  our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal or superior to our technology and products without infringing any of our intellectual property rights  or may design around our proprietary technologies 
for further information on our intellectual property and the difficulties in protecting it  see item business intellectual property 
our products rely on licenses from third parties  and if we lose access to these technologies  our revenues could decline 
we rely on technology that we license from others  including technology that is integral to our products 
we have entered into license agreements with sri international  ibm corporation  mit  olympus optical co  ltd  and heartport  inc  now part of johnson johnson 
any of these agreements may be terminated for breach 
if any of these agreements is terminated  we may be unable to reacquire the necessary license on satisfactory terms  or at all 
the loss or failure to maintain these licenses could prevent or delay further development or commercialization of our products 
see item business intellectual property 
public announcements of litigation events may cause our stock price to decline 
during the course of our administrative proceedings and or lawsuits with computer motion and brookhill wilk  llc  there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions  and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could have a substantial negative effect on the trading price of our stock 
our products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain domestic regulatory process 
if we do not obtain and maintain the necessary domestic regulatory approvals  we will not be able to market and sell our products in the united states 
our products and operations are subject to extensive regulation in the united states by the us food and drug administration  or fda 
the fda regulates the research  testing  manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  recordkeeping  promotion  distribution  and production of medical devices in the united states to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses 
in order for us to market certain products for use in the united states  we generally must first obtain clearance from the fda  pursuant to section k of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act ffdca 
clearance under section k requires demonstration that a new device is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed device 
if we modify our products after they receive fda clearance  the fda may require us to submit a separate k or pma for the modified product before we are permitted to market the products in the us in addition  if we develop products in the future that are not considered to be substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device  we will be required to obtain fda approval by submitting a premarket approval application pma 
the fda may not act favorably or quickly in its review of our k or pma submissions  or we may encounter significant difficulties and costs in our efforts to obtain fda clearance or approval  all of which could delay or preclude sale of new products in the united states 
furthermore  the fda may request additional data  require us to conduct further testing  or compile more data  including clinical data  in support of a k submission 
the fda may also  instead of accepting a k submission  require us to submit a pma  which is typically a much more complex application than a k 
to support a pma  the fda would likely require that we conduct one or more clinical studies to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective  rather than substantially equivalent to another legally marketed device 
we may not be able to meet the requirements to obtain k clearance or pma approval  or the fda may not grant any necessary clearances or approvals 
in addition  the fda may place significant limitations upon the intended use of our products as a condition to a k clearance or pma approval 
product applications can also be denied or withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following approval 
any delays or failure to obtain fda clearance or approvals of new products we develop  any limitations imposed by the fda on new product use or the costs of obtaining fda clearance or approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in order to conduct a clinical investigation involving human subjects for the purpose of demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a device  a company must  among other things  apply for and obtain institutional review board irb approval of the proposed investigation 
in addition  if the clinical study involves a significant risk as defined by the fda to human health  the sponsor of the investigation must also submit and obtain fda approval of an investigational device exemption ide application 
we may not be able to obtain fda and or irb approval to undertake clinical trials in the us for any new devices we intend to market in the united states in the future 
if we obtain such approvals  we may not be able to comply with the ide and other regulations governing clinical investigations or the data from any such trials may not support clearance or approval of the investigational device 
failure to obtain such approvals or to comply with such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for additional information concerning regulatory approvals of our products  see item business government regulation 
our products are subject to various international regulatory processes and approval requirements 
if we do not obtain and maintain the necessary international regulatory approvals  we will not be able to market and sell our products in foreign countries 
to be able to market and sell our products in other countries  we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with the regulations of those countries 
these regulations  including the requirements for approvals  and the time required for regulatory review vary from country to country 
obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals are expensive  and we cannot be certain that we will receive regulatory approvals in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products 
if we fail to obtain regulatory approval in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products  our ability to generate revenue will be harmed 
the european union requires that manufacturers of medical products obtain the right to affix the ce mark to their products before selling them in member countries of the european union 
the ce mark is an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable european medical device directives 
in order to obtain the right to affix the ce mark to products  a manufacturer must obtain certification that its processes meet certain european quality standards 
in january  we received permission to affix the ce mark to our da vinci surgical system and endowrist instruments for general surgical use 
we received additional ce approvals for use of our da vinci surgical system and endowrist instruments in cardiac surgery in september and february if we modify existing products or develop new products in the future  including new instruments  we will need to apply for permission to affix the ce mark to such products 
in addition  we will be subject to annual regulatory audits in order to maintain the ce mark permissions we have already obtained 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain permission to affix the ce mark for new or modified products or that we will continue to meet the quality and safety standards required to maintain the permissions we have already received 
if we are unable to maintain permission to affix the ce mark to our products  we will no longer be able to sell our products in member countries of the european union 
if institutions or surgeons are unable to obtain reimbursement from third party payors for procedures using our products  or if reimbursement is insufficient to cover the costs of purchasing our products  we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to support our business 
domestic institutions will typically bill the services performed with our products to various third party payors  such as medicare  medicaid and other government programs and private insurance plans 
if hospitals do not obtain sufficient reimbursement from third party payors for procedures performed with our products  or if government and private payors policies do not permit reimbursement for surgical procedures performed using our products  we may not be able to generate the revenues necessary to support our business 
in such circumstances  we may have to apply to the american medical association for a unique current procedural terminology code covering computer enhanced surgery 
if an application for a unique code is required  reimbursement for any use of our products may be unavailable until an appropriate code is granted 
the application process  from filing until adoption of a new code  can take two or more years 
our success in international markets also depends upon the eligibility of our products for reimbursement through government sponsored health care payment systems and third party payors 
reimbursement practices vary significantly by country 
many international markets have government managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new products and procedures 
other foreign markets have both private insurance systems and government managed systems that control reimbursement for new products and procedures 
market acceptance of our products may depend on the availability and level of reimbursement in any country within a particular time 
in addition  health care cost containment efforts similar to those we face in the united states are prevalent in many of the other countries in which we intend to sell our products and these efforts are expected to continue 
for further information on third party reimbursement policies  see item business third party reimbursement 
because our markets are highly competitive  customers may choose to purchase our competitors products or may not accept intuitive surgery  which would result in reduced revenue and loss of market share 
intuitive surgery is a new technology that must compete with established minimally invasive surgery and open surgery 
these procedures are widely accepted in the medical community and in many cases have a long history of use 
we also face competition from several companies that are developing new approaches and products for the minimally invasive surgery market 
in addition  we presently face increasing competition from companies who are developing robotic and computer assisted surgical systems 
our revenues may be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and market products that are more effective or less expensive than our products 
if we are unable to compete successfully  our revenues will suffer 
we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against current or potential competitors  especially those with greater resources 
in many cases  the medical conditions that can be treated using our products can also be treated by pharmaceuticals or other medical devices and procedures 
many of these alternative treatments are also widely accepted in the medical community and have a long history of use 
in addition  technological advances could make such treatments more effective or less expensive than using our products  which could render our products obsolete or unmarketable 
we cannot be certain that physicians will use our products to replace or supplement established treatments or that our products will be competitive with current or future technologies 
if software defects are discovered in our products  we may incur additional unforeseen costs  hospitals may not purchase our products and our reputation may suffer 
our products do incorporate computer software 
software can contains errors or failures  especially when first introduced 
in addition  new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or performance problems that  despite testing  are discovered only after commercial shipment 
because our products are designed to be used to perform complex surgical procedures  we expect that our customers will have an increased sensitivity to software defects 
we cannot assure you that our software will not experience errors or performance problems in the future 
if we experience software errors or performance problems  any of the following could occur delays in product shipments  loss of revenue  delay in market acceptance  diversion of our resources  damage to our reputation  increased service or warranty costs  or product liability claims 
we have limited experience in manufacturing our products and may encounter manufacturing problems or delays that could result in lost revenue 
we have manufactured a limited number of our products for sales to customers 
we may be unable to establish or maintain reliable  high volume manufacturing capacity 
even if this capacity can be established and maintained  the cost of doing so may increase the cost of our products and reduce our ability to compete 
we may encounter difficulties in scaling up production of our products  including problems involving production yields  quality control and assurance  component supply shortages  shortages of qualified personnel  and compliance with state  federal and foreign regulations 
manufacturing our products is a complex process 
if demand for our products exceeds our manufacturing capacity  we could develop a substantial backlog of customer orders 
if we are unable to establish and maintain larger scale manufacturing capabilities  our ability to generate revenues will be limited and our reputation in the marketplace would be damaged 
if our manufacturing facilities do not continue to meet federal  state or european manufacturing standards  we may be required to temporarily cease all or part of our manufacturing operations  which would result in product delivery delays and lost revenue 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities and our operations will continue to be regulated by the fda for compliance with good manufacturing practice requirements contained in the fda s quality system regulations qsr 
we are also required to comply with the iso series standards in order to produce products for sale in europe 
if we fail to continue to comply with good manufacturing practice requirements or iso series standards  we may be required to cease all or part of our operations until we comply with these regulations 
we are currently in compliance with iso series standards 
in march  the fda inspected our mountain view facility and the good manufacturing practice issues raised during the inspection have been satisfactorily resolved with the fda 
maintaining such compliance is difficult and costly 
we cannot be certain that our facilities will be found to comply with good manufacturing practice requirements or the iso series standards in future audits by regulatory authorities 
the state of california also requires that we maintain a license to manufacture medical devices 
our facilities and manufacturing processes were inspected in february in march  we passed the inspection and received a device manufacturing license from the california department of health services 
in march  our facilities and manufacturing processes in our sunnyvale facility were re inspected by the fdb 
we passed this audit and are awaiting issuance of our device manufacturing license renewal 
we will be subject to periodic inspections by the california department of health services and if we are unable to maintain this license following any future inspections  we will be unable to manufacture or ship any products 
our reliance on sole and single source suppliers could harm our ability to meet demand for our products in a timely manner or within budget 
some of the components necessary for the assembly of our products are currently provided to us by sole source suppliers or single source suppliers 
we purchase components through purchase orders rather than long term supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of inventory 
the disruption or termination of the supply of components could cause a significant increase in the costs of these components  which could affect our profitability 
a disruption or termination in the supply of components could also result in our inability to meet demand for our products  which could harm our ability to generate revenues  lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage our reputation 
furthermore  if we are required to change the manufacturer of a key component of our products  we may be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines 
the delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could delay our ability to manufacture our products in a timely manner or within budget 
the use of our products could result in product liability claims that could be expensive  divert management s attention and harm our business 
our business exposes us to significant risks of product liability claims 
the medical device industry has historically been litigious  and we face financial exposure to product liability claims if the use of our products were to cause injury or death 
there is also the possibility that defects in the design or manufacture of our products might necessitate a product recall 
although we maintain product liability insurance  the coverage limits of these policies may not be adequate to cover future claims 
particularly as sales of our products increase  we may be unable to maintain product liability insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or adequate amounts 
a product liability claim  regardless of its merit or eventual outcome  could result in significant legal defense costs 
a product liability claim or any product recalls could also harm our reputation or result in a decline in revenues 
our growth will place a significant strain on our management systems and resources and  if we fail to manage our growth  our ability to market  sell and develop our products may be harmed 
in order to complete clinical trials  scale up manufacturing  expand marketing and distribution capabilities and develop future products  we must expand our operations 
we expect that future expansion will occur particularly in the areas of sales and marketing  manufacturing and research and development 
this expansion will likely result in new and increased responsibilities for management personnel and place significant strain upon our management  operating and financial systems and resources 
we plan to sell our products primarily through direct sales  and we currently have a small sales organization 
our products require a complex marketing and sales effort targeted at several levels within a prospective customer s organization 
we will continue to expand our sales team over the next months to achieve our sales growth goals 
we will face significant challenges and risks in building and managing our sales team  including managing geographically dispersed sales efforts and adequately training our sales people in the use and benefits of our products 
to accommodate our growth and compete effectively  we will be required to improve our information systems  create additional procedures and controls and expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
our future success will depend in part on the ability of current and future management personnel to operate effectively  both independently and as a group 
we cannot be certain that our personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future operations 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel  our ability to compete will be harmed 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff 
in order to pursue our product development  marketing and commercialization plans  we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in research and development  clinical testing  government regulation  manufacturing  sales and marketing  and finance 
our product development plans depend in part on our ability to attract and retain engineers with experience in mechanics  software and optics 
attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success  and competition for qualified personnel is intense  particularly in silicon valley 
we may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition for such personnel among technology and healthcare companies  and universities 
the loss of any of these persons or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business and our ability to compete 
international sales of our products account for a significant portion of our revenues  which exposes us to risks inherent in international operations 
our growth may be limited if we are unable to successfully manage our international activities 
our business currently depends in large part on our activities in europe  and a component of our growth strategy is to expand our presence into additional foreign markets 
sales to markets outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of our sales for the year ended december    and  respectively 
we will be subject to a number of challenges that specifically relate to our international business activities 
these challenges include failure of local laws to provide the same degree of protection against infringement of our intellectual property  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors  which could slow our growth in international markets  the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation  the expense of establishing facilities and operations in new foreign markets  and building an organization capable of supporting geographically dispersed operations 
currently  a majority of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
if we are unable to meet and overcome these challenges  our international operations may not be successful  which would limit the growth of our business 
failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete  result in lower revenues and may prevent us from taking advantage of market opportunities 
we expect that our existing capital resources and the revenue to be derived from the sale of our products will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs at least through after that  we may need to raise additional funds and we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms  we may not be able to  among other things develop or enhance our products and services  acquire technologies  products or businesses  expand operations in the united states or internationally  hire  train and retain employees  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements 
our failure to do any of these things could result in lower revenues and could harm our business 
sales by current stockholders could cause our common stock price to decline 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares in the market 
these sales may also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate to raise funds through future offerings of common stock 
as of december   several entities beneficially owned more than of the outstanding shares of our common stock  including allan g 
lozier  investor guernsey ltd 
and patmark company  inc on may   june   and october   mayfield fund distributed   and  shares of intuitive common stock to its partners  respectively 
on december   morgan stanley venture investors iii  lp distributed  shares of intuitive common stock to its partners and morgan stanley venture partners iii  lp distributed  shares of intuitive common stock to its partners 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are not subject to any meaningful market risks related to currency  commodity prices or similar matters 
we are sensitive to short term interest rate fluctuations to the extent that such fluctuations impact the interest income we receive on the investment of the remaining proceeds from our june initial public offering 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities 
we classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities as fixed rate if the rate of return on such instruments remains fixed over their term 
these fixed rate investments include commercial paper and government and non government debt securities 
we classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities as variable rate if the rate of return on such investments varies based on the change in a predetermined index or set of indices during their term 
these variable rate investments primarily included money market accounts 
the average duration of all of our investments as of december was approximately years 
at december   approximately of our investment portfolio was composed of investments with original maturities of one year of less 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments that may be subject to interest rate risk and the weighted average interest rates by year of maturity in thousands weighted average fair interest rate value cash equivalents variable rate  marketable securities fixed rate mature in
