item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview for the year ended december   the company earned a net profit of  compared to a net loss of  in this increased profitability was the result of various factors  each of which is more fully described below 
the more significant factors include decreased cost of sales resulting from a reduction in the individual inventory cost components material  labor and overhead  combined with lower production scrap costs resulting from the on going refinement of the lean manufacturing process  a decrease in operating expenses resulting from the cost containment measures implemented by the company during the first quarter of  and an increase in other income resulting from a gain on the sale of the company s non business related real property 
on february   the company announced that it had instituted a series of cost containment measures in an effort to reduce its operating expenses and improve its profitability and cash position 
these measures are discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
results of these measures realized in are discussed throughout the remainder of this discussion and analysis 
results of operations net sales compared to net sales for decreased  or  from  in to  this slight decrease reflects sales declines in the domestic and canadian aftermarket and the private brand and original equipment markets  partially offset by an increase in the export volume 
the sales decreases in the domestic and canadian aftermarket reflect a continued industry wide softness in the automotive replacement parts industry that began in the third quarter of the decrease in the private brand volume reflects reduced sales to a specific customer  while the decrease in the original equipment volume is consistent with the decreased year to date production volume of the domestic automotive and light duty truck manufacturers 
the increase in the export volume reflects the broadening of the company s customer base into new export markets 
net sales in the fourth quarter of decreased  in comparison to the fourth quarter of this decrease reflects a decline in the domestic piston ring aftermarket volume  slightly offset by an increase in the original equipment volume 
net sales in the canadian aftermarket  private brand and export markets  were relatively flat during the fourth quarter of  in comparison to the fourth quarter of the decrease in the domestic aftermarket volume reflects the continued industry wide softness in that market 
the increase in the original equipment volume reflects the improved production volume experienced by the domestic automotive and light duty manufacturers in the fourth quarter of the company is continuing to see an improvement in the original equipment volume during the first few months of the company anticipates  however  that the industry wide softness in the domestic aftermarket may continue into and  as such  has incorpo rated this expected softness into its future net sales and earnings estimates 
during  the company s canadian subsidiary  hastings  inc  began to distribute and administer products for other us based suppliers into the canadian market  on a commission basis 
in march  the company signed an agreement with karl schmidt unisia to market and distribute zollner brand pistons into the domestic and mexican aftermarkets 
in early november  the company signed an agreement with automotive components limited acl to market and distribute acl brand engine bearings  gaskets and import pistons into those same markets 
the company began marketing and distributing the acl products during the first quarter of  therefore  there was no sales impact from this agreement during under the terms of the various distribution agreements  the company retains a portion of the net product revenues  in the form of commissions  in exchange for providing marketing and distribution services 
commission revenues  included in net sales  from these r elatively new distribution arrangements amounted to   and  in  and  respectively 
the company anticipates that these  and possibly additional  distribution arrangements will increasingly contribute to its future sales and profitability 
compared to net sales for decreased  or  from the decrease reflected sales declines in the domestic and canadian aftermarkets  and the private brand and original equipment markets  partially offset by an increase in the company s export volume 
the sales decreases in the domestic and canadian aftermarkets reflected the initial effects of the industry wide softness in the automotive replacement parts industry 
the decreases in the private brand and original equipment markets reflected the loss of certain customers through market consolidation and a sustained downturn in the original equipment market 
the increase in the export volume reflected the results of the company s focus on increasing sales in the export market 
the total sales decrease in also reflected a reduction of approximately  in casite additives sales 
prior to  casite sales were included in the company s financial statements 
in october  the company entered into a owned joint venture for the purpose of expanding its additives offerings through both increased global market penetration and an expansion of the product offerings under the casite name 
as a result  casite sales  in  were recorded in the unconsolidated financial statements of the joint venture rather than through net sales within the company s financial statements 
net sales in the fourth quarter of decreased  or  from the total 
this decrease was the result of the same factors noted in the above discussion 
cost of sales and gross profit compared to cost of sales for decreased  or  from  in to  the company s gross profit margin on net sales increased from in to in a slight reduction in cost of sales would be expected  in  as a result of the decrease in net sales 
however  there were several factors that contributed to the more significant reduction in cost of sales  and the corresponding increase in the gross profit margin for export volume  as noted above  increased in this export volume has traditionally carried a lower gross profit margin than domestic sales due to the lower level of operating expenses not included in cost of sales that are required to service that volume 
domestic aftermarket sales  on the other hand  decreased during sales in this market have traditionally carried a higher gross profit margin in order to support the higher level of operating expenses associated with that volume 
while t his sales mix change did have a negative effect on the gross profit margin  it was slightly offset by the positive gross profit impact generated from the marketing and distribution of zollner brand pistons 
additionally  as discussed above  the company experienced reductions in its individual inventory cost factors material  labor and overhead in the material cost reduction is the result of lower raw material costs obtained from the company s rolled steel vendors  combined with lower cast iron costs incurred by the company in processing its own foundry castings 
the labor cost reduction reflects efficiencies gained through lean manufacturing and decreased costs resulting from the work force reduction implemented in the first quarter of overhead costs also decreased  reflecting an increased effort by the company to control the non fixed portion of these costs 
the company also incurred lower production scrap costs in  resulting from the on going refinement of its lean manufacturin g processes  which further contributed to the reduction in cost of sales  and the corresponding increase in the gross profit margin 
along with these two factors that occurred in  there were several cost of sales items in that resulted in the large reduction in cost of sales when comparing the two periods 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed adjustments to its labor cost standards to reflect efficiencies obtained in its transition to a lean manufacturing environment 
while this new manufacturing environment is expected to result in lower labor costs in future years  the related adjustments resulted in additional cost of sales for as year end inventory was adjusted downward to reflect the application of these lower labor standards 
also during  and primarily in the fourth quarter  overhead costs increased relating to on going maintenance of plant equipment and tooling expense necessary to support the lean manufacturing environment 
cost of sales for the fourth quarter of decreased  or  from the fourth quarter of while the gross profit margin increased to from during these periods 
these improvements primarily reflect the adjustments  in  to the labor cost standards applied to inventory  combined with the increased overhead costs incurred in the fourth quarter of  as discussed above 
the gross profit margin generated in the fourth quarter of was lower than the gross profit margin generated during the first three quarters of  primarily reflecting a fourth quarter adjustment of the rolled steel perpetual inventory quantities to lower physical inventory levels 
compared to cost of sales for decreased  or  from the company s gross profit margin on net sales decreased slightly to in from in while the overall decrease in cost of sales is consistent with the decrease in net sales  several factors negatively affected the gross profit margin in as noted above  the company experienced a change in its sales mix in this sales mix change saw a shift in sales from the domestic aftermarket which generates a higher gross profit on net sales to the export market which generates a lower gross profit on net sales 
domestic aftermarket sales were down in due to an overall softness in the replacement parts market 
export volume increased in as a result of the company s focus on this market 
the company s gross profit margin was also negatively affected by changes to the labor cost standards applied to inventory in the fourth quarter  as noted above 
material costs remain ed relatively unchanged from the prior year average  with increases in cast iron costs offset by reductions in rolled steel costs 
labor costs increased slightly from the prior year average  with a labor cost increase resulting from the collective bargaining agreement  partially offset by the effects of the labor efficiencies noted above 
specific overhead costs  noted above  also increased during cost of sales for the fourth quarter of increased by  or  over the fourth quarter of this increase was primarily the result of the changes to the labor cost standards applied to inventory  as noted above 
the gross profit margin generated in the fourth quarter of was lower than the gross profit margin generated during the first three quarters of  reflecting the negative effect of the labor cost changes noted above  combined with the sales mix change noted above  the increase in overhead expenses noted above  an increase in group health insurance costs and the absence of gross profit from casite sales in operating expenses compared to total operating expenses for decreased  or  from  in to  advertising expenses increased  or  from the total 
this increase primarily reflects an increase in printed material costs relating to a one time charge for the start up of the marketing and distribution of zollner brand pistons  combined with the costs associated with the production of several piston ring brochures 
selling expenses decreased  or  from the total 
this decrease reflects decreases in various selling support costs  partially offset by increases in sales personnel costs  agents commissions and salesmen s travel costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or  from the total 
this decrease reflects decreases in legal and professional fees  the provision for doubtful accounts receivable  other general personnel support costs and property insurance costs  partially offset by a slight incre ase in general personnel costs 
the decrease in legal and professional fees reflects reduced activity relating to the company s retirees class action lawsuit described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts receivable reflects write offs  in  of specific customer accounts  offset slightly by an increase in the provision for several of the company s customers who sought chapter reorganization bankruptcy protection 
the current allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  at december  is considered adequate to cover any potential losses resulting from these bankruptcy proceedings 
the decrease in other general personnel support costs reflects the success of the cost containment measures implemented by the company during the first quarter of the decrease in property insurance costs reflects the deductible portion of an insured fire loss  in  that took place within the finished goods storage area of the company s us production facility 
fourth quarter operating expenses decreased  or  from the fourth quarter of total 
this decrease was the result of the same factors noted in the above discussion 
compared to total operating expenses for increased  or  from advertising expenses decreased  or  from the total 
this decrease reflected decreases in printed material and trade advertising costs  partially offset by an increase in advertising support salaries 
selling expenses increased  or  from the total 
this increase reflected increases in salesmen s travel and various sales personnel and support costs  partially offset by a decrease in volume driven agents commissions 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  from the total 
this increase reflected increases in the provision for doubtful accounts receivable  group health insurance  legal and professional fees  and property insurance costs  largely offset by decreases in general personnel support costs 
fourth quarter operating expenses decreased  or  from the total 
this decrease primarily resulted from a reduction in volume driven agents commissions  legal and professional fees and general support costs  partially offset by increases in salesmen s travel  the provision for doubtful accounts receivable and group health insurance costs 
other expenses compared to other expenses  net for decreased  from the total 
this decrease primarily reflects a combination of decreased interest expense and the fourth quarter gain on sale of property and equipment 
the decreased interest expense is due to a reduced reliance on the company s short term lines of credit  due to cash flow improvements in  combined with the favorable impact of declining short term interest rates throughout the gain on sale of property and equipment  amounting to  relates to the gain on sale of the company s non business related real property  as discussed below under liquidity and capital resources 
other  net income for decreased from primarily due to reduced net income recognized by the company relating to its investment in the casite joint venture 
fourth quarter other expenses  net decreased by  from the net total 
this decrease was the result of the same factors noted in the above discussion 
compared to other expenses  net for increased by  over the net total 
this increase reflected the increased interest expense arising from the added reliance on the company s short term lines of credit throughout  offset slightly by the income recognized from the company s investment in the casite joint venture  which is recorded as other  net income 
there was no income recognized from the joint venture in fourth quarter other expenses  net increased  from the total 
this increase was the result of the same factors noted in the above discussion 
taxes on income the impact of income taxes on the reported results of the company is detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the effective tax rate of is slightly higher than the statutory federal tax rate of due primarily to the impact of state income taxes and certain nondeductible expenses 
the recording of  of tax expense on a pre tax loss of  for primarily results from an increase in the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance of approximately  this increase related to foreign tax credits that management anticipated  based on recent financial results  were likely to expire unutilized in future years 
during   of foreign tax credits expired 
the tax amount was also impacted by the effect of state income taxes and certain nondeductible expenses 
the effective tax rate of is higher than the statutory federal tax rate of due primarily to the impact of state income taxes an d certain nondeductible expenses 
the effective tax rate was also affected by the increase in the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits that were expected to expire unutilized in as of december   the company recorded net deferred income tax assets of  the major components include the tax effect of net operating loss carryforwards of  and net accrued retirement and postretirement benefit obligations totaling  the realization of these recorded benefits is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income 
the net operating loss carryforwards expire in  and  if not previously utilized 
during  the company utilized net operating loss carryforwards of  resulting in a  reduction in the related deferred income tax asset 
management believes that the cumulative net operating loss carryforward will be fully utilized by late the company further expects to be able to realize the deferred tax assets related to the retirement and postretirement benefit obligations as it pays these benefits 
such payments will constitute an expense that is deductible for tax reporting purposes over many future years 
during each of the ten years prior to when the recent net operating loss carryforwards arose  the company has been able to deduct these benefit payments for tax reporting purposes and reduce its tax liability accordingly 
as a result of the plan amendment to the retiree medical plan as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  current tax deductible payments are expected to exceed the annual expense recognition for financial reporting purposes  thus accelerating the absorption of the future periods tax benefit 
management believes that it is more likely than not that adequate levels of future income will be generated to absorb the net operating loss carryforwards  the deductible amounts related to the retirement and postretirement benefit obligations and the remaining net deductible temporary differences 
however  based on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards at december  which must be utilized before foreign tax credit carryforwards can be utilized  management believes that it is more likely than not that the foreign tax credits will go unutilized prior to their expiration 
as a result  a valuation allowance has been recorded for the total foreign tax credits of  at december  liquidity and capital resources on february   the company announced that it had instituted a series of cost containment measures in an effort to reduce its operating expenses and improve its profitability and cash position 
the cost containment measures were in response to a continued softness in the domestic piston ring aftermarket and a downturn in the original equipment market 
the cost containment measures consisted of reductions in the salaried and hourly workforces and identification of reductions in various non payroll related expenses 
the workforce reductions resulted in  in severance payments 
the company also announced an indefinite suspension of its regular quarterly cash dividend and identified certain assets for possible future sale in an effort to further improve its cash position 
in early november  the company sold its non business related real property 
the gain on the sale of this property  amounting to  is included in other expenses  net in the consolidated statements of income included in item below 
the company s primary cash requirements continue to be for operating expenses such as labor costs  and for funding accounts receivable  capital expenditures and long term debt service 
historically  the company s primary sources of cash have been from operations and from bank borrowings 
these sources of cash depend on attaining future positive financial results 
the company believes that the cost containment measures implemented in  combined with the expected positive financial impact from the marketing and distribution agreements with zollner and acl  should allow it to generate sufficient cash from operations to assist in satisfying the company s cash requirements 
the future ability to utilize bank borrowings to satisfy the company s cash requirements is contingent upon the successful renewal of the company s short term line of credit and the refinancing of its long term debt with its primary lender 
the current  line of credit and term loan agree ment both mature on may  based on recent and anticipated future positive financial results  and preliminary discussions with its primary lender  the company expects to renew its short term line of credit and refinance its long term debt in may the company s short and long term debt represents its primary contractual obligations as of december  it has no significant lease or other commercial commitments and has no off balance sheet arrangements 
in late march  the company s loan agreement with its primary lender relating to its short term and long term borrowing was amended 
the primary terms of this amended loan agreement are detailed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item below 
the company maintains two additional lines of credit with banks aggregating  total short term lines available to the company as of december  totaled  of which  was unused 
in an effort to minimize its floating interest rate exposure relating to its long term borrowings  the company is a party to an interest rate swap agreement essentially fixing the interest rate on a portion of that debt within a small range 
the rate will fluctuate within to depending upon certain company performance parameters 
as of december  the fixed rate on those borrowings was and the notional amount of the swap agreement amounted to  during  the company generated  of net cash from operating activities 
the realized net income  depreciation and decreases in deferred income taxes and inventories were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable  a gain on the sale of property and equipment  and decreases in accounts payable and accruals and the postretirement benefit obligation 
the decrease in deferred income taxes primarily reflects the utilization of a portion of the net operating loss carryforward based on earnings for the year 
the decrease in inventories reflects a planned reduction in the company s inventory to certain levels  combined with the shortfall of production output versus customer demand during the first half of production output aligned with customer demand throughout the second half of the increase in accounts receivable reflects the timing of customer sales and the related payment terms associated with those sales 
the gain on the sale of p roperty and equipment reflects the sale of the company s non business related real property described earlier in this discussion 
while this sale resulted in additional cash to the company  it is not considered an operating cash flow item for purposes of determining cash flows provided by operating activities 
the decrease in accounts payable and accruals is due to a decrease in accruals for general accounts payable and interest  partially offset by increases in accruals for salesmen s bonuses and workers compensation 
the decrease in the postretirement benefit obligation reflects the excess of actual postretirement benefit claims paid over the actuarially determined annual expense 
the investing activities for reflect the company s continued support of its lean manufacturing environment  as well as the initial capital expenditures for the modernization of the company s main distribution center  now being utilized to distribute acl related products 
the investing activities also reflect the proceeds from the sale of the company s non business related real property discussed above 
the financing activities for reflect the working capital requirements that were primarily needed to fund the operating activity items noted above 
due primarily to the improved operating results  and the proceeds from the sale of the non business related real property  principal payments on the company s short term credit facility exceeded related borrowings by  the financing activities also reflect the principal payments under the amended loan agreement  as well as the restriction of paying dividends and repurchasing the company s common stock  as detailed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item below 
during  the company generated  of net cash from operating activities 
the realized depreciation  combined with decreases in accounts receivable  inventories  deferred income taxes and an increase in accounts payable and accruals  were partially offset by the net loss and a decrease in the postretirement benefit obligation 
the decrease in accounts receivable reflected the timing of customer sales and the related payment terms associated with those sales 
the decrease in inventories reflected a reduction in inventory requirements in relation to customer demand 
the decrease in deferred income taxes primarily reflected the increase in the valuation allowance for foreign tax credits that management anticipated were likely to expire unutilized in future years 
the increase in accounts payable and accruals reflected an increase in general accounts payable  taxes and compensation  offset slightly by a decrease in miscellaneous payables 
the decrease in the postretirement benefit obligation reflected the excess of actual postretirement benefit claims paid over the actuarially determined annual expense 
the investing activities for reflected the company s continued support of its lean manufacturing environment 
the investing activities also reflected the investment in a joint venture  in february  related to the casite brand additives products 
the financing activities reflected the working capital requirements that were primarily needed to fund the operating activity items noted above 
the financing activities also reflected the amortization of the company s long term obligation that was amended in march  and the purchase and retirement of  shares of the company s common stock 
this stock repurchase was part of the common stock repurchase program that the company announced in february this program is described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  the company generated  of net cash from operating activities 
the realized net income and depreciation  combined with decreases in accounts receivable  prepaid pension cost and deferred income taxes  were partially offset by increases in inventories and decreases in accounts payable and accruals and the postretirement benefit obligation 
the decrease in accounts receivable reflected the timing of customer sales and related payment terms associated with those sales 
the decrease in the prepaid pension cost reflected the recognition of the pension expense for the decrease in the net deferred income tax asset reflected the reduction of several deferred tax items  partially offset by the deferred tax effect of the net operating loss for tax purposes 
the increase in inventories reflected the company s continued efforts toward having sufficient product on hand in order to maintain adequate order fill for its customers 
the decrease in a ccounts payable and accruals primarily reflected the reduction in the compensation accrual  offset by slight increases in general accounts payable and miscellaneous payables 
the decrease in the postretirement benefit obligation reflected the excess of actual postretirement benefits paid over the actuarially determined annual expense 
the investing activities for reflected a decreased requirement for new capital equipment  as the company moved to finalize its transition into a lean manufacturing environment 
the investing activities also reflected the proceeds from the sale of obsolete plant equipment 
the financing activities for reflected the working capital requirements that were primarily needed to fund the operating activity items noted above 
the financing activities also reflected the amortization of the company s long term debt obligation 
as noted earlier in this discussion  in february  the company instituted a series of cost containment measures in an effort to reduce its operating expenses and improve its profitability and cash position 
initial results indicate that these cost containment measures have had a positive impact on earnings and cash flow  and are expected to continue to have a positive impact on future periods  although the company cannot be assured that this will happen 
these cost containment measures  combined with the expected positive earnings impact from the zollner and acl marketing and distribution agreements  should help to further improve the company s future financial outlook 
litigation contingency as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  on january   the company s retirees filed a class action lawsuit against the company as a result of the april amendment of the company s postretirement benefit plans 
the plans were amended principally to adjust the cost sharing provisions 
the suit alleges that the company denied class retirees and their dependents certain health insurance benefits to which the retirees had a vested right pursuant to the terms of the company s collective bargaining agreements 
the company has denied any wrongdoing in this suit  and intends to defend it and any related class certification vigorously 
minimal discovery has taken place in this lawsuit because the parties have been attempting to reach a settlement 
as of the date of this report  the company believes that it is making progress toward a settlement of this lawsuit  but there are still a number of contingencies to be satisfied before any settleme nt can be finalized  and ultimately any settlement must be approved by the court 
therefore  although the company is hopeful that a settlement will be reached  there is still the possibility that the case will not be settled  and that this lawsuit will be tried 
if this case is tried  the company s ultimate chances of success are uncertain 
if the retirees prevail  the company anticipates that a requirement to provide postretirement benefits at the pre amendment level would have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires that we adopt and follow certain accounting policies 
certain amounts presented in the financial statements have been determined based upon estimates and assumptions 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results could differ 
we have included below a discussion of our critical accounting policies that we believe are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements  how we apply such policies and how results differing from our estimates and assumptions would affect the amounts presented in our financial statements 
other accounting policies also have a significant effect on our financial statements  and some of these policies also require the use of estimates and assumptions 
note to the consolidated financial statements discusses our significant accounting policies 
allowance for possible losses on receivables we maintain an allowance for possible losses on receivables for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance is estimated based on historical experience of write offs  the level of past due amounts  information known about specific customers with respect to their ability to make payments and future expectations of conditions that might impact the collectibility of accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories we record inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon the age of specific inventory on hand and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
pension and postretirement obligations each year we calculate the costs of providing retiree benefits under the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
the key assumptions used in making these calculations are disclosed in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
the most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate used to value the future obligation and the expected return on plan assets 
we select discount rates commensurate with current market interest rates on high quality  fixed rate securities 
the expected return on assets is based on our current view of long term returns on assets held by the plans  which is influenced by historical averages 
if actual interest rates and returns on plan assets materially differ from our assumptions  future adjustments to our financial statements would be required 
net deferred income tax assets our estimates of deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred income tax assets and liabilities are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements  giving consideration to both timing and probability of realization 
as discussed earlier in this discussion and analysis  the recorded net deferred income tax assets are significant and our realization of these recorded benefits is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income 
if future levels of taxable income are not consistent with our expectations  we may be required to record an additional valuation allowance  which could reduce our net income by a material amount 
contingencies and litigation our determination of the treatment of contingent liabilities in the financial statements  including that related to litigation  is based on our view of the expected outcome of the applicable contingency 
we consult with legal counsel and other experts on matters related to litigation with respect to specific matters and matters in the ordinary course of business 
we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable of occurrence and the amount can be estimated 
a significant class action lawsuit  filed by the company s retirees  is discussed above under litigation contingency and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
to the extent additional information arises or the company s strategies change  it is possible that the company s best estimate of its probable liability in this and other matters may change 
new accounting standards emerging issues task force eitf  vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products  issued during  requires vendors to reduce their revenues by the costs reimbursed to their customers in connection with the customers purchase or promotion of the vendor s products 
this pronouncement specifically addresses co op advertising costs that are incurred by the vendor 
in accordance with eitf  co op advertising costs incurred by the company are required to be reflected as a reduction of net sales 
in previous years  co op advertising expenditures were included in advertising costs 
all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  issued in june  requires companies to recognize all derivative contracts as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and to measure them at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge  the objective of which is to match the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging derivative with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction 
for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument  the gain or loss is recognized in income in the period of change 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas nos 
and  was effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  historically  the company has not entered into derivatives contracts for speculative purposes 
the company does periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its floating rate borrowings 
however  the fair value of such derivatives is not significant 
accordingly  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item below  the adoption of the new standard on january  did not materially affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for the long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principal board s opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  related to the disposal of a segment of a business 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
forward looking statements with the exception of historical matters  the matters discussed in this commentary and elsewhere in this form k include forward looking statements that describe the company s plans  objectives  goals  expectations or projections 
these forward looking statements are identifiable by words or phrases indicating that the company or management expects  anticipates  projects  plans or believes that a particular event may occur  should occur or will likely occur in the future  or similar statements 
in addition to other risks and uncertainties described in connection with the forward looking statements contained in this commentary  there are many important factors that could cause actual results to be materially different from the company s current expectations 
anticipated future sales are subject to competitive pressures from many sources 
as an example  future sales could be affected by consolidation within the automotive replacement parts industry  whereby the company could lose sales due to a competitor purchasing all of the assets of a current customer of the company 
future sales could also be affected by current and future political and economic factors in the foreign markets where the company conducts business 
cost of sales and operating expenses may be adversely affected by unexpected costs associated with various issues 
for example  future cost of sales could be affected by unexpected expenses related to the future maintenance of a lean manufacturing environment 
future operating expenses could also be affected  for example  by such items as unexpected large claims within the company s self funded group health insurance plan  increased retiree health insurance claim exposure as a result of an adverse court ruling on the current retiree health issue  or bad debt expenses related to deterioration in the credit worthiness of a customer or customers 
furthermore  the company s cost containment measures described above under the heading liquidity and capital resources may not be as effective as the company anticipates 
the company may also be adversely affected by events relating to the terrorist attacks of september  these events and their repercussions create considerable economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect consumer buying behavior  automobile production  shipping and transportation costs  and other factors affecting the company and the automotive industry generally 
the foregoing is intended to provide meaningful cautionary statements of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the foregoing should not be construed as an exhaustive list of all economic  competitive  governmental and technological factors that could adversely affect the company s expected consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the company disclaims any obligation to update its forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks  which include changes in interest rates and changes in the foreign currency exchange rate as measured against the us dollar 
the company s interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its variable rate lines of credit used to finance its short term working capital needs and for general corporate purposes 
of the  total short term lines available to the company at december    was outstanding 
management believes that the fluctuation in interest rates in the near future will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements taken as a whole 
with respect to its variable rate long term borrowings  the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement essentially to fix the interest rate on  of the total  outstanding borrowings at december  the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company has a manufacturing distribution facility in canada 
the facility s sales are denominated in canadian dollars  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the canadian us exchange rate may positively or negatively affect the company sales  gross margins and retained earnings 
the company attempts to minimize currency exposure through working capital management 
the company does not hedge its exposure to translation gains and losses relating to foreign currency net asset exposures
