item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies matrix s financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
highlighted below are the accounting policies that management considers significant to the understanding and operations of matrix s business 
revenue recognition matrix records profits on long term contracts on a percentage of completion basis on the cost to cost method 
contracts in process are valued at cost plus accrued profits less billings on uncompleted contracts 
contracts are generally considered substantially complete when field construction is completed 
matrix includes pass through revenue and costs on cost plus contracts  which are customer reimbursable materials  equipment and subcontractor costs  when matrix determines that it is responsible for the procurement and management of such cost components on behalf of the customer 
matrix has numerous contracts that are in various stages of completion 
such contracts require estimates to determine the appropriate cost and revenue recognition 
at may   a sensitivity analysis of these estimates indicated that a change in total estimated contract revenues would result in a change in gross profits on these jobs 
matrix has a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contracts costs  and accordingly  does not believe these significant fluctuations would ever materialize 
however  current estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available 
if estimates of costs to complete long term contracts indicate a loss  provision is made through a contract write down for the total loss anticipated 
the elapsed time from award of a contract to completion of performance may be in excess of one year 
claims recognition claims are amounts in excess of the agreed contract price or amounts not included in the original contract price that a contractor seeks to collect from customers or others for delays  errors in specifications and designs  contract terminations  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price or other causes of unanticipated additional costs 
matrix records claims in accordance with paragraph of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
this statement of position states that recognition of amounts as additional contract revenue related to claims is appropriate only if it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and if the amount can be reliably estimated 
those two requirements are satisfied by management s determination of the existence of all of the following conditions the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim  additional costs are caused by circumstances that were unforeseen at the contract date and are not the result of deficiencies in the contractor s performance  costs associated with the claim are identifiable or otherwise determinable and are reasonable in view of the work performed  and the evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable 
if such requirements are met  revenue from a claim is recorded to the extent that contract costs relating to the claim have been incurred 
the amounts recorded  if material  are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements 
costs attributable to claims are treated as costs of contract performance as incurred

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk matrix s interest rate risk exposure primarily results from its debt portfolio which is influenced by short term rates  primarily prime rate and libor based borrowings under its credit agreement 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  matrix utilizes interest rate swaps to change the ratio of its fixed and variable rate debt portfolio based on management s assessment of future interest rates  volatility of the yield curve and matrix s ability to access the capital markets as necessary 
the following table provides information about matrix s term debt and interest rate swap that is subject to interest rate risk 
for term debt  the table presents principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for the interest rate swap  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the interest rate swap 
amounts in s fair value may  interest rate swap notional amount     pay rate receive rate day libor london interbank offer rate plus basis points matrix also utilizes a million revolving credit facility for which interest rate swaps are not utilized 
therefore  short term interest rate changes could have an impact on future interest expense on amounts outstanding on the credit facility 
at may   million was outstanding on the revolver at an interest rate of based on libor 
foreign currency risk matrix has a subsidiary company whose operations are located in canada  whose functional currency is the local currency 
historically  results have not been significantly impacted by movements in the foreign currency exchange rate 
however  these investments do have the potential to impact matrix s financial position  due to fluctuations in the local currencies arising from the process of translating the local functional currency into the us dollar 
management has not entered into derivative instruments to hedge the foreign currency risk 
a change in the respective functional currency against the us dollar would not have had a material impact on the financial results of the company for the year ended may
