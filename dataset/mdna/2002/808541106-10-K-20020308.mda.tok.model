these business segments manufacture and sell cigarette  plug wrap and tipping papers used to wrap various parts of a cigarette  reconstituted tobacco products and paper products used in cigarette packaging 
while the products are similar in each segment  they vary based on customer requirements and the manufacturing capabilities of each of the operations 
sales by a segment into markets primarily served by a different segment occur where specific product needs cannot be cost effectively met by the manufacturing operations domiciled in that segment 
for purposes of the segment disclosure in the following tables  the term united states includes operations in the united states and canada 
the canadian operations only produce flax fiber used as raw material in the us operations

sales volumes of the french businesses increased by six percent 
sales volumes of the us business unit were essentially unchanged

operating profit for the french businesses increased by million as a result of higher sales volumes  higher average selling prices and lower per ton wood pulp costs partially offset by increased costs of energy and other materials  as well as increased nonmanufacturing expenses 
excluding the million restructuring charge  operating profit in brazil increased by million primarily as a result of lower per ton wood pulp costs  higher average selling prices and the benefits of increased tobacco related paper sales volumes 
operating profit in the united states declined by million as a result of increased operating expenses at the spotswood mill  which were unfavorable by million for compared with the prior year  and higher purchased energy and nonmanufacturing expenses 
these unfavorable factors were partially offset by the effects of lower per ton wood pulp costs  higher average selling prices and improved mill operations other than at the spotswood mill 
total nonmanufacturing expenses increased by million as a result of higher general  research and selling expenses 
higher general expense was caused primarily by increased compensation and benefit costs 
research expense increased in the united states and brazil in support of new product development activities 
higher selling expense was incurred in france as a result of increased employee and agent compensation 
brazilian restructuring the brazilian printing and writing uncoated papers market experienced weakness in late and through the first half of  resulting in pressure on the company s operating margins for these products 
beginning in january  the company also reduced its sales of certain grades of these papers that had been negatively impacted by icms  a form of value added business tax 
in addition  in may  the brazilian government enacted an electricity rationing program which had an overall objective of a percent reduction in electricity consumption in brazil and mandated a percent reduction in electricity consumption by the paper industry in the most populated and industrialized regions of brazil 
in response to the brazilian government s electricity reduction directive  the company s brazilian business implemented an electricity reduction program  however  to achieve the required percent reduction  it was necessary to institute production curtailments 
machine downtime was taken to reduce production of the company s least profitable products 
the printing and writing uncoated papers business had been the company s least profitable product line in brazil while also being its largest electricity user 
the duration of the government s electricity reduction directive was uncertain  although it was expected to initially last at least six months through the traditional dry period in brazil 
the brazilian government s forced electricity reduction program was in response to unusually low water levels in the lakes and reservoirs supplying brazil s hydroelectric facilities that provide percent of that country s electricity 
as a result of these business conditions  the company decided during the second quarter of to exit the printing and writing uncoated papers business in brazil  which permitted the company s brazilian operations to comply with the government s electricity rationing program and to better focus on and service its other more profitable product lines 
this plan to restructure its brazilian operations resulted in the company recording a pre tax charge in of million  primarily for the non cash write down of assets related to the printing and writing uncoated papers business and employee termination and severance costs

worldwide sales volumes increased by three percent  which favorably affected net sales by million 
sales volumes of the brazilian business increased by percent  primarily as a result of increased sales of nontobacco related papers and sales outside brazil 
sales volumes of the french businesses increased by one percent 
sales volumes of the us business unit declined by three percent 
operating profit operating profit decreased by million  with lower operating profit in all three business segments  primarily as a result of higher wood pulp and energy costs  which in total increased operating expenses by million 
changes in the average per ton wood pulp costs compared with the prior year unfavorably impacted operating expenses by million  with energy costs increasing by million 
partially offsetting these higher operating expenses were the favorable effects of increased sales volumes  improved mill operations and lower nonmanufacturing expenses 
in france  operating profit declined by million primarily as a result of higher wood pulp and energy costs and lower average selling prices 
these negative effects were partially offset by the benefits of the french business unit s increased sales volumes  cost reduction activities and improved mill operations 
the us business unit s operating profit declined by million primarily due to the higher wood pulp and energy costs and additional expenses associated with implementation of the banded cigarette paper project at the spotswood mill 
the effects of the decline in sales volumes were offset by cost reduction activities and lower nonmanufacturing expenses 
in brazil  operating profit declined by million for the year as a result of higher wood pulp  energy and other material costs and increased business taxes 
these negative factors were partially offset by the effects of increased sales volumes  higher average selling prices  cost reduction activities and improved mill operations 
nonmanufacturing expenses decreased by million  primarily due to a reduction in selling expenses of the french business unit and lower general expenses  in part from personnel reductions implemented during non operating expenses the decline in interest expense in compared with was primarily due to a larger amount of interest capitalized to capital projects as well as lower average interest rates 
the increase in interest expense in compared with was primarily due to higher average interest rates  partially offset by a lower average amount of debt outstanding and the effects of changes in currency exchange rates 
the weighted average effective interest rate on the company s term loans was approximately percent in  percent in and percent in other income  net consisted primarily of interest income  royalty income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses in each of the years presented  as well as a favorable settlement related to a prior period claim in and recovery of prior period business taxes in income taxes the effective income tax rates for the years ended december   and were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
the effective income tax rate in compared with was impacted by a decrease in the french corporate income tax rate from percent for to percent for  which had been enacted in december the lower effective income tax rate in was due to several items  including a million favorable adjustment to reduce spanish deferred income tax valuation allowances  a favorable million tax benefit related to settlement of a prior period claim  a favorable million tax benefit related to an equity related payment from brazil and million of income tax benefits associated with treatment of certain repatriations during the year 
excluding the effects of these four items  the effective income tax rate for would have been percent

the company s cash flow from operations has been relatively stable historically  reflecting typically consistent demand for its products 
since the distribution  the company s cash flow from operations has exceeded the company s requirements for capital spending and dividends to stockholders by at least million each year 
impacting the cash flow from operations are changes in operating working capital 
in  changes in operating working capital contributed unfavorably to cash flow by million due primarily to lower accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts payable and accrued expenses were lower in compared with as a result of decreased liabilities at year end associated with capital projects and maintenance costs 
in  changes in operating working capital contributed favorably to cash flow by million due primarily to higher accounts payable and accrued expenses  partially offset by higher accounts receivable 
accounts payable and accrued expenses were higher in compared with as a result of recorded liabilities associated with capital projects and maintenance costs at december  accounts receivable was higher in compared with primarily because of increased french business unit export sales having longer payment terms 
in  changes in operating working capital contributed unfavorably to cash flow by million due primarily to lower accounts payable 
accounts payable was lower in compared with as a result of payments in early for capital projects included in accounts payable at december  during  the company and philip morris reached agreement to proceed with the modification of paper machines and related manufacturing equipment at the company s spotswood mill to produce commercial quantities of a new proprietary banded cigarette paper for philip morris 
capital spending to implement the banded cigarette paper project was million in and million in the construction phase of this project has been completed 
pursuant to the terms of the company s agreement with philip morris related to the modification of paper machines and related equipment at the spotswood mill  the company was solely responsible for obtaining any financing necessary to support this project 
funding for the spotswood mill conversion and increased working capital requirements came from internal sources and from advance payments by philip morris against future product purchases 
capital spending in included i million toward the banded cigarette paper project  ii million to bring back into service a cigarette paper machine that had previously been shut down at the spotswood mill and iii million toward a wastewater treatment facility upgrade at the spay  france mill 
capital spending in included i million toward the banded cigarette paper project  ii million toward a high speed slitter at the spotswood mill  and iii million toward improvement of a reconstituted tobacco leaf machine in the spay mill 
capital spending in included i million toward the speed up of two machines in the french mills  ii million toward the expansion of converted tipping paper capacity at the malaucene mill  and iii million toward replacement of a yankee dryer in the spay mill 
in december  the company announced that the board of directors had authorized the repurchase of shares of the company s common stock during the period january  through december  in an amount not to exceed million

through december   no repurchases had been made by the company under this authorization 
the company s ongoing requirements for cash are expected to consist principally of amounts required for capital expenditures  stockholder dividends  purchases of the company s common stock and working capital 
the company incurs spending necessary to meet legal requirements and otherwise relating to the protection of the environment at the company s facilities in the united states  france  brazil and canada 
for these purposes  the company incurred total capital expenditures of million in  and anticipates that it will incur approximately to million in and to million in  none of which is the result of environmental violations 
the major projects included in these estimates are million toward upgrading wastewater treatment facilities and million for installation of ink solvent treatment equipment in france 
including expenditures associated with environmental matters  as of december  the company had unrecorded outstanding commitments for capital expenditures of approximately million 
the company s mills in quimperle  france and in brazil each have minimum annual commitments for calcium carbonate purchases  a raw material used in the manufacturing of some paper products  which together total approximately million per year 
the company s prior and expected future purchases at these mills are at levels that exceed such minimum levels 
the current calcium carbonate contracts expire in for the operations in france and in for the operations in brazil 
in addition  the company s total future minimum obligations under non cancelable operating leases having an initial or remaining term in excess of one year as of december  are less than million annually over the next five years 
the company has declared and paid quarterly dividends of fifteen cents per share since the second quarter of management currently expects to continue this level of quarterly dividend 
the company has credit agreement covenants that require the company to maintain certain financial ratios  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  none of which under normal business conditions materially limit the company s ability to pay such dividends  and the company does not currently anticipate any change in business conditions of a nature that would cause future restrictions on dividend payments as a result of its need to maintain these financial ratios 
on january   the company announced that the board of directors had declared a quarterly cash dividend of fifteen cents per share of common stock 
the dividend will be payable on march  to stockholders of record on february  as of december   the company had approximately million available under its short term revolving credit facilities in the united states and france  and on january   the company renewed these short term facilities to january  coincident with renewal of these short term facilities  the company entered into new five year revolving credit facilities which do not require any principal payments until their maturity on january   unless the company were to violate its covenants under the new credit agreement 
the company does not currently anticipate any change in business conditions of a nature that would cause the company to violate its covenants under the new credit agreement 
interest rates under these short term and long term credit facilities are at market rates 
the company also has other bank credit facilities available in the united states  france and brazil 
the company s credit facilities are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the first quarter of  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix the variable rate component of certain of its variable rate long term debt 
the combination of these interest rate swap agreements began with a notional amount of million  declining to million effective january   and declining again to million effective july  through the remainder of the contract terms ending january  these interest rate swap agreements fix the london interbank offered rate for us dollar deposits at percent 
this had the effect of fixing the company s interest rate including margin at percent on million of its debt through january   the effective date of new credit facilities  percent on million of its debt from february  through july   and percent on million of its debt from august  through january  these interest rate swap contracts were designated as cash flow hedges and the company applied the short cut method treatment under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
as such  the company assumed there was no ineffectiveness of these hedge contracts  and accordingly  no gain or loss was recorded in the income statement relative to the changes in fair value of these interest rate swap contracts  but instead the changes in fair value of the contracts were reflected in other comprehensive income loss 
there were no other interest rate related derivative contract agreements entered into by the company during the company believes its cash flow from operations  together with borrowings still available under its revolving and other credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund its ongoing cash requirements 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting 
sfas no 
changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
thus  amortization of goodwill  including goodwill recorded in past business combinations  will cease upon adoption of sfas no 
 which will be effective for the company beginning january  the company expects no material effect on its financial statements as a result of these new accounting standards 
also in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the statement is effective for the company s financial statements for the period beginning january   with earlier application encouraged 
the company expects no material effect on its financial statements as a result of this new accounting standard 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
although sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains most of the concepts of that standard  except that it eliminates the requirement to allocate goodwill to long lived assets for impairment testing purposes and it requires that a long lived asset to be abandoned or exchanged for a similar asset be considered held and used until it is disposed  ie the depreciable life should be revised until the asset is actually abandoned or exchanged 
also  the new standard includes the basic provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for presentation of discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business  where that component can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the entity 
this statement is effective for the company s financial statements for the period beginning january   with earlier application encouraged 
the provisions of this new statement generally are to be applied prospectively 
the company expects no material effect on its financial statements as a result of this new accounting standard 
outlook the markets for the company s products are expected to be relatively stable during cigarette production in the united states continues to decline as a result of declines in domestic cigarette consumption and exports of cigarettes manufactured in the united states  however the declines in and were at a lower rate than in and sales volumes of tobacco related papers of the company s us business segment appear to have stabilized 
the negative impact of lower us cigarette production is being partially offset by the company s increased market share within the north american market 
outside the united states  trends of improvement are expected to continue in tobacco related paper sales in eastern europe and russia 
sales of tobacco related papers within the brazilian market appear to have stabilized  and the company s brazilian business continues to benefit from increased sales to latin american countries outside of brazil 
the company s brazilian business is expected to experience a decline in its net sales in the first half of compared with the comparable period of as a result of a decision in the second quarter of to exit the brazilian printing and writing uncoated papers market see brazilian restructuring above 
the company s brazilian business segment s net sales of printing and writing uncoated papers totaled approximately million during  with most of those sales occurring in the first half of without the sale of the marginally profitable printing and writing uncoated papers  an improved mix of products sold and better operating results are expected in as a result of the restructuring of the brazilian operations 
selling prices for the company s tobacco related products are expected to be fairly stable during  although the current level of wood pulp costs and the strong us dollar versus the euro and other foreign currencies continue to exert some pressure on the company s selling prices  limiting the company s ability to implement price increases since several competitors have cost structures that are based upon those weaker currencies 
the per ton cost of wood pulp appears to be near the bottom of the pulp price cycle 
cost of products sold for the first half of is expected to benefit from lower per ton wood pulp costs compared with comparable periods of the prior year 
during the second half of  per ton wood pulp costs are expected to be approximately the same as or slightly above the level of the comparable period of the prior year 
the company expects its energy costs to be lower in than in  although this benefit is expected to be largely offset by higher insurance expenses  primarily property insurance  and increased compensation and benefit costs  mainly due to medical and pension expenses 
during  the company and philip morris reached agreement to proceed with the modification of paper machines and related manufacturing equipment at the company s spotswood mill to produce commercial quantities of a new proprietary banded cigarette paper for philip morris 
the construction phase of the banded cigarette paper project was completed during the fourth quarter of the banded cigarette paper project had a negative impact on financial results because of additional expenses associated with its implementation 
additional expenses will be incurred during related to additional process checkouts  machine trials and product qualification  however spotswood mill operating costs are expected to improve in compared with the banded cigarette paper project is expected to benefit future periods although it is not expected to result in a significant increase in the production and sale of banded cigarette paper during cigarette manufacturers have not finalized their plans for the use of this new product 
the company expects its consolidated effective income tax rate to be approximately percent for primarily as a result of a decline in the french corporate income tax rate from percent for to percent for the company currently expects its capital spending to be in the range of to million for  focused primarily on product quality improvements and cost reduction opportunities 
during  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of the company s common stock during the period january  through december  in an amount not to exceed million 
the company did not repurchase any of its common stock during under this program 
common stock repurchases in will be dependent upon various factors  including cash availability  the stock price and strategic opportunities 
critical accounting policies the company s accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported and disclosure of contingencies 
following are four critical accounting matters which are both very important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and required management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgements 
the accounting for these matters was based on current facts and circumstances which  in management s judgement  hold potential for change which could affect management s future estimates such that future financial results could differ materially from financial results based on management s current estimates 
income tax valuation allowances the company records and maintains income tax valuation allowances as necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount which is estimated more likely than not to be realizable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the company has available net operating loss carryforwards  excess foreign tax credit carryforwards  alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and other various tax credits in the jurisdictions in which it operates 
certain of these potential future benefits are not expected to be utilized in a favorable manner prior to their expiration 
as a result  the company has valuation allowances against certain of the above mentioned assets which totaled million as of december   reducing the related net deferred tax asset to an amount which is estimated to be realizable 
although realization of reserved amounts is possible  management currently believes it is more likely than not that the reserved amounts will not be realized in a favorable way prior to their expiration or review by taxing authorities 
however  the company continues to evaluate possible methods to favorably utilize those assets that are reserved  and the facts and circumstances on which the company s estimates and judgements are based could change 
therefore  it is possible the company could benefit in the future by some or all of the million of deferred tax assets reserved as of december  for additional information regarding income taxes and valuation allowances  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
icms litigation the company evaluates contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
accordingly  when a material loss contingency exists  the company accrues an estimated loss when the likelihood that the future event or events will confirm the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
if no accrual is made for a material loss contingency because both of the above conditions are not met  or if an exposure to loss exists materially in excess of an accrual that is made  disclosure regarding the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or additional loss may have been incurred 
as described in detail under litigation in part i  item  legal proceedings  swm b received assessments from the taxing authorities of the state of rio de janeiro  brazil related to icms taxes 
as of december   the assessment totaled approximately million  of which approximately million is covered by an indemnification agreement with the former owner of the predecessor of swm b  for a net exposure to the company of approximately million 
the courts granted swm b relief from having to bond the potential tax liability while it challenges the assessment 
this matter is not currently expected to be resolved for several years 
swm b continues to vigorously contest the assessment and believes the matter will ultimately be resolved in its favor 
the company s current evaluation of the matter is that swm b is more likely than not to prevail in its challenge of the assessment under the facts and law as presently understood 
however  there is a reasonable possibility that swm b will ultimately be required to pay all or a portion of this contingent liability  which would adversely impact the company s future financial statements 
property  plant and equipment valuation paper manufacturing  which is the company s primary manufacturing process  is a mature and capital intensive process 
as a result  the company makes substantial investments in property  plant and equipment which are recorded at cost 
the cost of depreciable property  plant and equipment is depreciated on the straight line method for accounting purposes over the depreciable lives of the assets 
depreciable lives are based on the company s estimates of the useful lives of the assets  that is the period over which the company expects to benefit from the use of the asset 
paper machines and related equipment are not readily obsoleted and are generally depreciated over estimated useful lives of years 
banded cigarette paper production assets are generally depreciated over estimated useful lives of years 
the company periodically assesses the likelihood of recovering the cost of long lived assets based on its expectation of future profitability and undiscounted cash flow of the related operations 
these factors  along with management s plans with respect to the operations  are considered in assessing the recoverability of property  plant and equipment 
facts and circumstances upon which management s estimates and plans are based could change  thus the possibility exists of a material adjustment to the company s financial statements in the future 
pension accounting estimates the company recognizes the estimated compensation cost of employees pension benefits over their approximate period of service to the company in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits 
the company s earnings are impacted by amounts of expense recorded related to pension benefits  which primarily consist of us and french pension benefits 
each year s recorded expense is an estimate based on actuarial calculations of the company s accumulated and projected benefit obligations for its various plans 
these actuarial calculations utilize several key actuarial assumptions which require management judgement  the most significant of which are the discount rate  used to determine the present value of estimated future retirement benefit payments  and the long term rate of return on plan assets  which is the expected average rate of return on plan assets which are expected to pay future benefits 
the company believes that its selections for these key actuarial assumptions are reasonable estimates for its plans and experience 
the discount rates used for the company s determination of projected benefit obligations and accumulated benefit obligations for its us employee pension plans were percent and percent at december  and  respectively 
the discount rate fluctuates from year to year based on current market interest rates for high quality fixed income investments 
the company s assumed annual long term rate of return on plan assets for its us employee pension plan was percent in both and and was lowered to percent for although the investment performance experience of the company s plans during the last two years has been negative  directionally the same as a similarly weighted composite of the major us equity and fixed income market indices  the plan achieved strong positive investment returns the three years prior to that such that the average rate of return on the company s plan assets over the last five years has approximated the estimated long term rate 
despite how reasonable the company believes its estimates are for these key actuarial assumptions  future actual results will likely differ from the company s estimates  and these differences could materially affect the company s future financial statements either unfavorably or favorably 
additionally  it is possible that assets of the company s plans could decline as a result of negative investment returns  which combined with increasing amounts of accumulated benefit obligations  could result in the company being required to make significant cash contributions to its plans in future periods 
for additional information regarding pension plan assets  benefit obligations and accounting assumptions  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
summary while a material impact to its future financial results or financial condition related to one or more of the above matters is possible  the company does not currently believe it is likely 
the company continually updates and assesses the facts and circumstances regarding these critical accounting matters and other significant accounting matters affecting estimates in its financial statements 
in addition to these accounting matters  other factors may affect the company s results  as described below 
factors that may affect future results many factors outside the control of the company could impact the company s results 
while not an exhaustive list  the following important factors could cause the company s actual results for and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
international business risks in addition to its us operations  the company has manufacturing facilities in france  brazil and canada 
the company  principally through its french and brazilian subsidiaries  markets and sells products in over countries  many of which are third world markets which are subject to international business risks  including unsettled political and economic conditions  expropriation  import and export tariffs  controls and restrictions  monetary exchange controls  inflationary economies  changes in currency value  changes in business and income tax regulations and risks related to restrictions on repatriation of earnings or proceeds from liquidated assets of foreign subsidiaries 
euro currency conversion on january   of the member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legal currencies and one common currency the euro 
the euro now trades on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions 
beginning in january  new euro denominated bills and coins were issued  and legal currencies are being withdrawn from circulation 
the company established a committee to identify and implement changes necessary to address the systems and business issues raised by the euro currency conversion 
these issues included the need to adapt computer and other business systems and equipment to accommodate euro denominated transactions  competitive implications of increased price transparency within european union countries  changes in currency exchange costs and rate exposures  continuity of contracts that required payment in a legal currency and tax implications of the conversion 
the company s french subsidiaries utilize multi currency software that was capable of euro denominated sales and purchase transactions on january  consideration was also given to other potential issues in connection with the conversion  including those mentioned above 
the company s french subsidiaries purchased software for translating current and historical data into euro currency data  which was fully implemented by mid january the company did not experience any significant negative consequences of these issues  the euro has become the functional currency of the company s european subsidiaries and the euro conversion had no material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
tax and repatriation matters the company and its subsidiaries are subject to various business and income tax laws in each of the countries in which it does business through wholly owned subsidiaries and through affiliates 
although the company believes it complies with the many business and income tax requirements of each of its operations  the company is exposed to the possibility of changes in enacted laws and interpretations of laws which could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
also  the company evaluates its overall financing plans in the various jurisdictions in which it operates and manages international movements of cash from and amongst its foreign subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner  however  an unanticipated international movement of funds due to unexpected changes in the company s business or in needs of the business could result in a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
market risk as a multinational entity  the company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
the company utilizes a variety of practices to manage these market risks  including operating and financing activities and  where considered appropriate  utilizing derivative instruments 
the company uses derivative instruments only for risk management purposes and not for trading or speculation 
all derivative instruments used by the company are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions in order to reduce credit risk and risk of nonperformance by third parties 
foreign currency risk the company has subsidiaries located in france  brazil  canada and spain 
the company  together with its subsidiaries  conducts business in over countries worldwide transacting some of its business in foreign currencies 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have an impact on the company s operating profit 
since the company and its subsidiaries transact business in many other countries  some of those sale and purchase transactions are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the company s operations 
as a result  changes in exchange rates between the currency in which the transaction is denominated versus the local currency of the company s operations into which the transaction is being recorded can impact the amount of local currency recorded for such transaction 
this can result in more or less local currency revenue or cost related to such transaction  and thus have an effect on operating profit of the company 
additionally  changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have an impact on the amount reported in other income expense  net 
once the above indicated receivables and payables from the sale and purchase transactions have been recorded  to the extent currency exchange rates change prior to settlement of the balance  a gain or loss on the non local currency denominated asset or liability balance may be experienced  in which case such gain or loss is included in other income expense  net 
the company utilizes forward and swap contracts and  to a lesser extent  option contracts to selectively hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk when it is practical and economical to do so 
the use of these contracts minimizes transactional exposure to exchange rate changes because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instrument will offset  in whole or in part  the loss or gain on the underlying foreign currency exposure 
these instruments are entered into with well known money center banks  insurance companies or government agencies counterparties 
usually these contracts extend for no more than months 
the company believes that the foreign currency risks that would not be hedged were the counterparties to fail to fulfill their obligations under the contracts are minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties 
management of foreign currency transactional exposures was not changed during  and the company does not expect any significant change in such exposures or in the strategies it uses to manage such exposures in the near future 
as of december   a ten percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the functional currencies of the company and its subsidiaries against the prevailing market rates of non local currencies involving the company s transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pre tax loss of approximately million 
these hypothetical gains or losses on foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are defined as the difference between the contract rates and the hypothetical exchange rates 
while the company believes the above loss resulting from the hypothetical unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be material to the company s results of operations  the company reduces this risk by selectively hedging its exposure when it is practical and economical to do so 
interest rate risk the company holds a combination of variable and fixed rate debt consisting of short and long term instruments 
the company selectively hedges its exposure to interest rate increases on its variable rate long term debt when it is practical and economical to do so 
the company utilizes various forms of interest rate hedge agreements  including interest rate swap agreements and forward rate agreements 
most often the company utilizes variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements  typically with contractual terms no longer than months 
the company s strategy to manage exposure to interest rate changes did not change during  and management does not expect any significant changes in its exposure to interest rate changes or in how such exposure is managed in the near future 
various outstanding interest bearing instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in fair market value of fixed rate debt due to differences between current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments 
with respect to the company s fixed rate debt outstanding at december   a ten percent change in interest rates would not result in a material change in the fair market value of such debt 
with respect to the company s variable rate debt  a ten percent change in interest rates would impact the company s future annual pre tax earnings by approximately million 
commodity price risk the company is subject to commodity price risk  the most significant of which relates to the price of wood pulp  which is the company s largest single component of cost 
the per ton cost of wood pulp is cyclical in nature and more volatile than general inflation 
the company consumed approximately   and  metric tons of wood pulp in  and  respectively 
during the period from january through december  the us list price of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp  a representative pulp grade used by the company  ranged from a low of per metric ton in september to a high of per metric ton in the latter half of and in january selling prices of the company s paper products are influenced  in part  by the market price for wood pulp  which is determined by worldwide industry supply and demand 
generally  over time  the company has been able to increase its selling prices in response to increased per ton wood pulp costs and has generally reduced its selling prices when wood pulp costs have significantly declined 
increases in prices of wood pulp could adversely impact the company s earnings if selling prices are not increased or if such increases do not fully compensate for or trail the increases in wood pulp prices 
derivative instruments have not been utilized by the company to manage this risk 
with respect to the company s commodity price risk  a hypothetical ten percent change in per ton wood pulp prices would impact the company s future annual pre tax earnings by approximately million  assuming no compensating change in the company s selling prices 
the company believes that  while its exposure to commodity price risk is material to its results of operations  such risk is understood by its customers and over time changes in the price of wood pulp are typically reflected in selling prices 
general inflation due to competitive pressures  the company is not always able to pass along its cost increases through increased selling prices 
the company s main costs impacted by general inflation are wages and salaries  energy  chemicals  employee benefit costs  primarily medical and pension expenses  and costs of insurance  particularly property insurance 
seasonality sales of the company s products are not subject to seasonal fluctuations  except in the united states and brazil 
in the united states  customer shutdowns typically occur in july and december and typically have resulted in reduced net sales and operating profit during those two months 
additionally  the us mills shut down equipment to perform additional maintenance during these months  resulting in higher product costs and reduced operating profit 
in brazil  customer orders are typically lower in december due to a holiday season through much of january and february 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state  local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to the environmental impact of air  water and other emissions from its mills as well as its disposal of solid waste generated by its operations 
the company believes it is operating in compliance with  or is taking action aimed at ensuring compliance with  such laws and regulations 
while the company has incurred in the past several years  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures in order to comply with these laws and regulations  these costs are not expected to materially affect the company s business or results of operations 
the company  or its predecessor  is currently named as a potentially responsible party at one hazardous waste disposal site  the liability for which was previously recorded and the remainder of which is not material 
however  there can be no assurance that a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements will not occur at some future time as a result of environmental matters 
additional information concerning environmental matters is disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in part i  item legal proceedings herein 
legal proceedings information concerning legal proceedings is disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in part i  item legal proceedings herein 
in addition  the company and its subsidiaries are involved in legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties and  while it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against the company and its subsidiaries  management believes that such actions and claims will be resolved without a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements 
reliance on significant customers most of the company s customers are manufacturers of tobacco products located in more than countries around the world 
two such customers have accounted for a significant portion of the company s net sales in each of the last several years  and the loss of one or both such customers  or a significant reduction in one or both of these customers purchases  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
tobacco products and governmental actions in recent years  governmental entities around the world  particularly in the united states  have taken or have proposed actions that may have the effect of reducing consumption of tobacco products 
reports and speculation with respect to the alleged harmful physical effects of cigarette smoking and use of tobacco products have been publicized for many years and  together with actions to restrict or prohibit advertising and promotion of cigarettes or other tobacco products and to increase taxes on such products  are intended to discourage the consumption of cigarettes and other such products 
in the fourth quarter of  the major us cigarette manufacturers reached agreement with all us states and several commonwealths and territories to settle health care cost recovery and other claims 
in anticipation of these settlements and as a direct result of these settlements  most of the us cigarette manufacturers increased prices of cigarettes significantly 
domestic cigarette consumption has declined  in part due to these price increases which  in turn  decreases demand for the company s products 
during  the us department of justice filed a multi billion dollar civil suit against the tobacco industry 
in addition  litigation is pending against the major manufacturers of consumer tobacco products seeking damages for health problems allegedly resulting from the use of tobacco in various forms and for alleged violations of antitrust laws 
it is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation or what effect adverse developments in pending or future litigation may have on the tobacco industry  its financial liquidity or relationships with its suppliers 
also in recent years  certain governmental entities  particularly in the united states  have considered or proposed actions that would require cigarettes to meet specifications aimed at reducing their likelihood of igniting fires when the cigarettes are not actively being smoked 
the state of new york has enacted a law directing that such a set of requirements be implemented and scheduled to take effect beginning in mid cigarette manufacturers are in varying stages of development of cigarettes with such characteristics 
philip morris and the company previously announced the joint development of a banded cigarette paper that may make a cigarette less likely to ignite certain fabrics and have entered into a licensing and royalty agreement covering future commercialization of this new paper 
while the joint development effort with philip morris was undertaken in advance of legislative initiatives in certain states to make cigarettes less likely to ignite certain fabrics when left unattended  the banded cigarette paper product that resulted from the joint development program  marketed under the name paper select by philip morris  is directed toward the same objective as the legislation 
this joint development effort is also discussed in part i  item herein under the caption philip morris supply agreement 
the company also has patents related to alternative means for addressing ignition control and continues to work on other possible innovations with other customers and on its own as the cigarette industry faces these evolving requirements 
it is not possible to predict what additional legislation or regulations relating to tobacco products will be enacted  or to what extent  if any  such legislation or regulations might affect the consumer tobacco products industry in general 
during  percent of the company s net sales were from products used by the tobacco industry in the making and packaging of cigarettes or other tobacco products 
management is unable to predict the effects that the above described legal and governmental actions might have on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
forward looking statements certain matters discussed in this report  particularly in the foregoing discussion regarding the outlook of the company  critical accounting policies and factors that may affect future results  constitute forward looking statements  generally identified by  but not limited to  phrases such as the company expects or the company anticipates  as well as by use of words of similar effect  such as appears  could  should  may and typically
