item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data and our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including but not limited to those described in exhibit to this annual report 
overview we are a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of single patient use airway management products 
our products address the anesthesia and respiratory critical care markets as well as the sleep personal ventilation markets and the pharmaceutical technology services 
see note to the financial statements for segment information 
we have classified our vital pharma business as a discontinued operation 
accordingly  the results of vital pharma are not reflected in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our net revenue from continuing operations was derived from four product lines as follows during the periods indicated fiscal years ended september  products and services in thousands anesthesia    respiratory critical care    sleep    pharmaceutical technology services    total    the percentage of our net revenue derived from each of our product lines was as follows during the periods indicated fiscal years ended september  products and services anesthesia respiratory critical care sleep pharmaceutical technology services total we sell our products in over countries worldwide 
in the us  we sell most of our anesthesia and respiratory critical care products primarily to hospitals using our direct sales force and certain major health care distributors 
outside of the us  most of our anesthesia and respiratory critical care sales have been made through distributors  however  we recently entered into a strategic alliance agreement with a medical device manufacturer rusch gmbh that should govern a substantial portion of our international sales of anesthesia and respiratory critical care products in the future 
our sleep ventilation products are sold primarily outside of the us through our direct sales force and country specific distributors 
we compensate our direct sales force principally though salary and commission payments  included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
sales to distributors are made at our list price 
when the distributor provides us with documentation verifying that the product has been shipped to an end user that is entitled to a price lower than our list price  we owe the distributor a rebate equal to the difference between our list price and the lower price to which that end user is entitled 
we record these sales upon shipment of the product in accordance with our sales policy and in the same period record an estimated sales allowance for the expected sales rebate to the distributor 
we record this sales rebate allowance as a reduction of gross revenue 
recent acquisitions as part of our strategic plan to expand significantly into the obstructive sleep apnea field  we acquired our interests in our breas medical ab and sleep services of america subsidiaries through a series of transactions over a period of several years breas medical ab o during the period from november through may   we acquired a ownership stake in breas for million 
o on may   we purchased an additional of breas from two minority shareholders  for an initial payment of million  with an earn out based on a formula of sales and profits 
o the final earnout payment to the two minority shareholders for the additional  totaling million  was made in april o our final purchase  amounting to million  for the remaining of the minority interest in breas was completed in april o the total purchase price for breas was approximately million 
o we accounted for our equity ownership in breas under the equity accounting method for the fiscal year ended september  and for the first eight months of the following fiscal year 
we reported our proportionate share of breas net income of  in fiscal and  in fiscal in other income expense 
once we acquired a controlling position  we included all of breas results in our consolidated financial statements for the four months ended september   consisting of net revenue of million and net income before minority interest of  and for all subsequent periods 
the portion of breas that we did not own was recorded as a minority interest  reducing our net income for each reporting period 
o as part of the settlement of the earnout agreement with one of the minority shareholders  who was also the former chief executive officer of breas medical ab  breas medical acquired the former chief executive officer s ownership interest in sprl percussionaire 
the purchase price for that interest is included in the million payment 
additional payments to the founder of sprl percussionaire may be due based upon an earnout agreement for units sold 
sleep services of america o in june and may  we purchased million of common stock and convertible preferred stock of national sleep technologies  a company engaged in the operation of diagnostic sleep centers 
o in june  we converted our preferred stock into common stock of national sleep technologies  at that point  we owned of the common stock 
o on january   our national sleep technologies business was merged with hsi medical services corporation  a subsidiary of the johns hopkins health system corporation  to form sleep services of america 
no cash was contributed at that time 
instead  we received a equity interest in sleep services of america  an affiliate of johns hopkins health system corporation received a equity interest in sleep services of america and the other minority shareholders of national sleep technologies received a interest in sleep services of america 
o subsequent to the merger  we paid  to certain of the minority shareholders to increase our ownership to  and reduce the minority ownership to 
o initially  we reported our interest in national sleep technologies under the equity accounting method 
as a result  our share of national sleep technologies losses of  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal was included in our other income expenses for our fiscal years and and for the first eight months of fiscal when we converted our preferred stock investment into common stock  we began consolidating the results of national sleep technologies in our consolidated financial statements 
for the four months ended september   and the fiscal years ended september  and  this business produced million  million  and million in net revenue  respectively  and   and  of net income  respectively  all of which was included in our results of operations 
the portion of sleep services of america not owned by us is recorded as a minority interest 
stelex tvg on march   we acquired stelex  inc for million in cash 
stelex was a private company which  like our subsidiary  the validation group  inc  was engaged in regulatory compliance counseling 
we structured the transaction as a merger of stelex into the validation group  renamed the surviving corporation stelex the validation group  inc and accounted for the transaction as a purchase 
critical accounting principles and estimates we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to asset impairment  revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  and contingencies and litigation 
we state these accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and at relevant places in this discussion and analysis 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements o through september   we amortized goodwill and intangibles on a straight line basis over their estimated lives 
upon our adoption of sfas no 
on october   we ceased amortizing goodwill and will perform an annual impairment analysis based upon discounted cash flows to assess the recoverability of the goodwill  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
for the year ended september  we completed this impairment test 
see note to the financial results that details impairments and other charges credits recorded in  and if we are required to record impairment charges in the future  it would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
o we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in bad debt expense 
as of september   the allowance for doubtful accounts was  we determine the adequacy of this allowance by evaluating individual customer receivables  considering the customer s financial condition and credit history and analyzing current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
o sales to distributors are made at our list price 
when the distributor provides us with documentation verifying that the product has been shipped to an end user that is entitled to a price lower than our list price  we owe the distributor a rebate equal to the difference between our list price and the lower price to which that end user is entitled 
we record these sales upon shipment of the product in accordance with our sales policy and in the same period record an estimated sales allowance for the expected sales rebate to the distributor 
we record this sales rebate allowance as a reduction of gross revenue 
we utilize a moving average based on prior history to make these estimates 
o we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
these matters frequently arise in disputes regarding the rights to intellectual property  where it is difficult to assess the likelihood of success and even more difficult to assess the probable ranges of recovery 
although we currently are not aware of any legal proceeding that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us  if we become aware of any such claims against us  we will evaluate the probability of an adverse outcome and provide accruals for such contingencies as necessary 
o we have established an allowance for inventory obsolescence 
the allowance was determined by performing an aging analysis of the inventory  based upon this review  inventory is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or its net realizable value 
as of september   our inventory allowance for obsolescence was  results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statement of income data as a percentage of our revenue

impairment and other charges credits 
during the year ended september   we reversed million in litigation accruals as a result of the successful conclusion of a patent infringement suit 
this litigation predated our acquisition of marquest 
at the time of this acquisition  we were advised that marquest had potential liability as the indemnitor of a distributor which was being sued for patent infringement in japan 
we recorded a sizable liability at the time of the marquest acquisition and increased that liability during the pendency of the litigation as a result of a lower court decision against us 
the accruals were reversed during the quarter ended march  when the tokyo supreme court ruled in favor of our distributor  thereby ending the legal proceeding 
offsetting this benefit was an impairment charge of million related principally to our chinese subsidiary  based on an evaluation of its business

in fiscal  our primary capital expenditures were million for the buy out of an operating lease for the fair market value of our colorado plant equipment and  for the purchase of a packaging line for our colorado facility 
we expect that our capital expenditures in the future will depend in part upon the capital requirements of any businesses that we acquire 
our current policy is to retain working capital and earnings for use in our business  subject to the payment of certain cash dividends 
such funds may be used for product development  product acquisitions and business acquisitions  among other things 
we regularly evaluate and negotiate with domestic and foreign medical device companies regarding potential business or product line acquisitions or licensing arrangements 
we believe that the funds generated from operations  along with our current working capital position and available bank credit  will be sufficient to satisfy our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
this statement constitutes a forward looking statement 
our liquidity could be adversely impacted and our need for capital could materially change if costs are substantially greater than anticipated  we were to undertake acquisitions demanding significant capital  operating results were to differ significantly from recent experience or adverse events were to affect our operations 
at september   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties other than what is disclosed in note of notes to year end consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  including the impact of material price changes and changes in the market value of our investments and  to a lesser extent  interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business as described below  we employ policies and procedures with the objective of limiting the impact of market risks on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations is not material to our financial condition 
we do not enter into interest rate and foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes 
to the maximum extent feasible  we price products from vendors and to customers in us dollars and to receive payment in us dollars 
historically  the international portion of our sales has been relatively small and the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our earnings generally has been small relative to other factors that also affect earnings  such as unit sales and operating margins 
however  the international segment is expected to grow both in terms of actual sales and as a percentage of our total sales and we may in the future need to revise or change our approach to managing interest rate and foreign currency transactions 
our risks involving price changes relate to raw materials used in our operations 
we are exposed to changes in the prices of resins and latex for the manufacture of some of our products 
we do not enter into commodity futures or derivative instrument transactions 
except with respect to our single source of supply for face masks discussed above in item  it is our policy to maintain commercial relations with multiple suppliers and when prices for raw materials rise to attempt to source alternative suppliers
