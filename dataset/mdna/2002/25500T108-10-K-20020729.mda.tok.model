item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
see future growth and operating results subject to risk at the end of this item for factors that could cause future results to differ materially 
overview we design  develop and market equipment used in building and expanding telecommunications networks 
our products fall into two categories  echo cancellation equipment and equipment that enables and facilitates communications over fiber optic networks 
to date  the majority of our revenue has been derived from sales of our echo cancellation products 
since entering the echo cancellation market  we have continued to refine our echo cancellation product to meet the needs of the ever changing telecommunications marketplace 
we are currently selling our fifth generation echo cancellation product  which began production shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal we began sales of our first optical communications product in september since that time our optical communications products have also evolved to meet the changing needs of our customers 
the current optical amplifier technology began shipment in fiscal our optical business is also in the process of taking a major step forward from being a subsystem provider to offering a complete optical switching and transport system  known as titanium 
since completing our initial public offering in june  we have completed three acquisitions see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
all of these acquisitions were done to bring needed technical skills into our research and development groups to aid in new product introductions 
on february   we completed our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of telinnovation in exchange for a total of  shares of common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
the total value of the acquisition of approximately million was accounted for in three discrete components 
the first  approximately million related to purchased research and development  was written off in the fourth quarter of fiscal next  approximately million related to developed technology and goodwill was capitalized and is being amortized to expense over its estimated life of years 
the remaining million relates to restricted shares  the cost of which was recorded as deferred stock compensation and was being charged to compensation expense in our research and development operations over the three year vesting period of the shares  assuming the holders of the restricted shares remain in our employ during the vesting period 
in april  we sold the echo cancellation software technology and related assets  previously acquired from telinnovation  to ti for a nominal gain see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
on july   we completed our acquisition of atmosphere networks inc in exchange for a total of  shares of common stock and assumption of outstanding options with a collective aggregate value of million  and million of cash 
acquisition costs totaled approximately  the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
the total value of the acquisition of approximately million comprises approximately million in net assets  million associated with the value of the established workforce and million of goodwill 
the goodwill and established workforce costs were capitalized and are being amortized over their estimated lives of four years 
effective may   we will begin applying sfas  which replaces the amortization of goodwill with a regular evaluation of the remaining unamortized balance of goodwill for impairment see recent accounting pronouncements  below 
we generally recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of a definitive agreement exists  shipment to the customer has occurred  title and all risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  acceptance terms  if any have been fulfilled  no significant contractual obligations remain outstanding  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
if any of these conditions are not satisfactorily met  revenue from that transaction is deferred until all conditions are met 
we offer a warranty  ranging from one year to five years  on all of our products 
the warranty generally provides that we will repair or replace any defective product within one year to five years from the invoice date 
we accrue for warranty costs at the time we recognize product revenue  based on our experience 
to date  the majority of our revenue has been derived from sales of our echo cancellation products 
we derived approximately  and of our revenue from the sale of our echo cancellation products in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect that a majority of our revenue will continue to come from sales of our echo cancellation products for the foreseeable future 
historically the majority of our sales have been to customers in the us these customers accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in fiscal   and respectively 
however  sales to some of our customers in the us may result in our products eventually being deployed internationally  especially in the case of any original equipment manufacturer that distributes overseas 
to date  substantially all of our international sales have been export sales and denominated in us dollars 
our revenue historically has come from a small number of customers 
our five largest customers accounted for over  and in fiscal   and respectively 
qwest  our largest customer for the past few years  accounted for only of our sales in fiscal  a time period in which revenues were substantially less than in recent prior periods  as compared to and of our revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated years ended april  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative purchased research and development amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss fiscal years ended april  and revenue 
revenue decreased to in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary reason for this decrease was the decline in sales of our echo cancellation products as we continued to experience the slowdown in infrastructure spending by our telecommunications customers  which began in the second half of fiscal and continued throughout fiscal despite this slowdown in spending  our echo cancellation products remained the primary source of revenue in fiscal  representing of fiscal revenue 
our series of fourth generation echo cancellation products remained the main contributors to the echo cancellation revenue stream in fiscal our fifth generation  oc echo cancellation system  which began production shipment in the fourth quarter of fiscal  saw limited activity in fiscal as the primary customer  qwest  substantially decreased its spending to expand and or upgrade its network 
revenue from echo cancellation products was million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal revenue from licenses of our echo cancellation software  prior to the sale of that technology to ti  represented less than of total revenue in both fiscal and although our optical products were also impacted by the slowdown in infrastructure spending  they experienced a much more modest decline from fiscal as one of our new oem relationships has begun to generate meaningful sales levels 
revenue from optical products was million in down from million in fiscal geographically  our fiscal revenue remained primarily domestic  at of total worldwide revenue a slight decreased from in fiscal this decrease was due in large part to the domestic telecommunications market being softer than the rest of the world in fiscal the slowdown in capital spending in the telecommunications industry we first experienced in the latter half of fiscal has continued throughout  and we anticipate will continue to have a substantial effect on our revenues for the foreseeable future 
we expect that sales of our echo cancellation products will remain the source of the majority of our revenue for most of fiscal  at least until our titanium optical system begins shipping for revenue  which is currently scheduled for near the end of fiscal however  if shipments of titanium are delayed due to technical difficulties or adverse market conditions  then it would be unlikely that we would receive any revenue from this product in fiscal cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists of direct material costs  personnel costs for test and quality assurance  costs of licensed technology incorporated into our products  provisions for inventory and warranty expenses and other indirect costs 
cost of goods sold decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal is primarily due to the decline in product sales in fiscal this decline in product costs was partially offset by a shift in the sales mix towards higher cost optical products and to a lesser extent increases in operations department costs  primarily salary and related and facilities costs 
also partially offsetting this decline in overall cost of sales was a million provision for excess inventory related to our oc echo cancellation system  due to our largest customer for that product making a sudden and significant reduction in its projected demand 
while we currently do not expect near term demand for this product to substantially improve  should demand from this customer or others for our oc product increase over current expectations  it is possible that some or all of this inventory could be used 
gross profit 
gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the primary factors causing this decrease are changes in the sales mix from our historically high margin echo cancellation products toward lower margin optical products  increased provisions for inventory as discussed above and the relatively fixed manufacturing organization s costs being spread over a smaller revenue base 
gross margins on our echo cancellation products were down to in fiscal from in fiscal  due in large part to the provision taken for excess inventory of the oc product and to a lesser extent due to continued pressures on selling prices and the relatively fixed nature of our manufacturing costs 
gross margins on our optical products dropped to in fiscal from in fiscal  due in larger part to our optical sales being more heavily concentrated in lower margin oem products in fiscal and the relatively fixed nature of our manufacturing costs 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily driven by across the board increases in personnel and related costs as we expanded all facets of our operations to prepare for the introduction and sale of our new titanium optical system and materials and consulting expenses related to development of our titanium optical system 
however  at the end of the first half of fiscal  we implemented a hiring freeze and subsequently completed a reduction in force to ensure we had the proper employees in the proper positions 
the reduction in workforce resulted in a charge of approximately  which has been included in cost of goods sold and operating expenses based on the capacities in which the terminated employees worked 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs including commissions and costs associated with customer service  travel  trade shows  communications and outside consulting services 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary causes for the increase were increases in personnel and related costs and promotion and trade show costs as we introduced and began to position ourselves for production shipment of our new titanium product 
partially offsetting these increases were reduced commission costs due to the lower sales levels in fiscal we expect to experience a modest increase in our level of sales and marketing spending in fiscal  as we continue to put the infrastructure in place for our introduction of titanium and attempt to further penetrate the domestic and international markets with our echo cancellation and optical subsystem products 
research and development 
research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  contract consultants  equipment and supplies used in the development of echo cancellation and optical communications products  as well as amortization of deferred stock compensation associated with our acquisitions of telinnovation and atmosphere networks 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is primarily related to increased personnel and related costs and increased materials and consulting costs primarily associated with our optical communications products  principally our titanium optical system 
personnel and related costs were up million due mostly to hiring  including the former ilotron engineers who were hired independent from our acquisition of ilotron s technology 
we increased spending on materials  product development and test  and consulting services by million in fiscal primarily related to our titanium optical product 
amortization of deferred stock compensation associated with our acquisitions of telinnovation and atmosphere was million and million in fiscal  respectively  and million and million in fiscal  respectively 
as a result of our sale of our echo software technology and the transfer of employees to ti  at the end of fiscal  we will no longer have amortization charges with respect to the acquisition of telinnovation 
we expect research and development expenses  exclusive of amortization of stock compensation  in fiscal to remain relatively flat with fiscal levels as we move closer to the first production shipments of our titanium product and we continue to refine our echo cancellation and optical subsystem product offerings 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for corporate officers and finance and human resources personnel  and legal  accounting and consulting costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to decreased personnel and related costs  as the level of executive compensation declined year over year and the level of recruiting was cut in the second half of the fiscal year after our hiring freeze was implemented 
amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets 
in fiscal  we recorded expense of million  an increase of million from fiscal  for amortization of acquisition related intangible assets  including goodwill  purchased technology and established workforce 
these assets were acquired as part of the acquisitions of telinnovation  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and of atmosphere networks  in the first quarter of fiscal the basis for the allocation and expected amortization periods are detailed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
due to the sale  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  of our echo cancellation software technology and related assets  which were acquired as part of our telinnovation acquisition  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements and the adoption of sfas effective may  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  we expect that amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles will be substantially eliminated beginning in the first quarter of fiscal however  the million in net goodwill that exists at april  will have to be reviewed on a regular basis for impairment consistent with the guidance in sfas based on the analysis done as part of our adoption of sfas  we believe that an impairment loss has occurred 
we are finalizing the amount of the impairment loss but expect that a write down of a substantial amount  if not all  of the goodwill balance of approximately million will be recorded upon adoption of the new standard in the first quarter of fiscal this loss is due to the continuing soft telecommunications market and the depressed values of telecommunications equipment provider stocks 
other income expense 
other income expense consists of interest income on our invested cash and cash equivalent balances  offset by interest expense attributable to our capital leases 
other income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decline was primarily attributable to the decreased interest income on funds invested due to lower average interest rates earned on invested balances and to a lesser extent lower average invested cash balances during fiscal the decline in interest earned was partially offset by a million gain realized on the sale of our echo cancellation software technology and related assets see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
income taxes consist of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
our effective tax rate in fiscal was as compared to in fiscal the principal reasons for the existence of a tax provision in fiscal despite the operating loss for the year are certain non deductible costs associated with our acquisitions  the amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets  and the establishment of a million valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  due to our continued operating losses and the fact that recovery of these assets is now dependent on future operating profits 
the factors that contributed to a higher effective tax rate in fiscal were primarily related to the amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets combined with the relatively small pretax profit for fiscal these adverse impacts on the tax rate were partially offset by the effect of having earned greater tax exempt interest income in fiscal we will not recognize a tax benefit on our future net operating losses until we establish a consistent pattern of profitability 
this will result in our having a near zero effective tax rate international earnings  which have been insignificant  will continue to be subject to taxation until such time as we can demonstrate a proven history of profits to justify reestablishing our deferred tax assets 
fiscal years ended april  and revenue 
revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary reason for this increase was the growth in sales of our optical amplifiers and subsystems products as we continued to win new customers and introduce new products in fiscal our echo cancellation products remained the primary source of revenue  representing of fiscal revenue  however  we experienced significant decreases in echo product revenues in the second half of fiscal as we were impacted by the slowdown in capital spending in the telecommunications industry 
our series of fourth generation echo cancellation products were the main contributors to the echo cancellation revenue stream in fiscal we also introduced in fiscal  and shipped in volume in the fourth quarter  our fifth generation and highest density echo cancellation product  the oc echo cancellation system 
geographically  our fiscal revenue remained primarily domestic  at of total worldwide revenue  however  domestic revenue decreased from in fiscal as we experienced significant growth in export sales to china increase and latin america over increase in fiscal cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists of direct material costs  personnel costs for test and quality assurance  costs of licensed technology incorporated into our products  provisions for inventory and warranty expenses and other indirect costs 
cost of goods sold increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal is primarily due to hiring in operations  higher levels of sales  a change in the shipment mix toward higher cost optical products  and indirect cost increases such as rent expenses and inventory charges 
those increases more than offset our ongoing trend of reducing the cost of purchased inventory 
gross profit 
gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the primary factors causing this decrease  in addition to the increases in cost of goods sold  are changes in the sales mix from echo cancellation to lower margin optical products 
also  within the optical product family  sales were more concentrated in lower margin products in fiscal average selling prices also declined in fiscal  in particular for our echo cancellation products  putting additional pressure on margins 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs including commissions and costs associated with customer service  travel  trade shows  communications and outside consulting services 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary causes for the increase were increases in personnel and related costs  including travel  to support expansion of our customer service functions and marketing efforts for products both domestically and internationally  including the formation of new direct and oem channels partnerships 
research and development 
research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  contract consultants  equipment and supplies used in the development of echo cancellation and optical communications products  as well as amortization of deferred stock compensation associated with our acquisitions of telinnovation and atmosphere networks 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is primarily related to increased personnel and related costs and increased materials and consulting costs associated with both our echo cancellation products and optical communications products 
personnel and related costs were up million due mostly to hiring  including the engineers who had been part of atmosphere networks 
we increased spending on materials  product development and test  and consulting services by million in fiscal for our echo cancellation efforts  primarily on oc and stm products  as well as in the optical communications and networking products labs 
in addition  amortization of deferred stock compensation increased by million to million in fiscal related to the acquisitions of telinnovation million in fiscal  million in fiscal and atmosphere networks million in fiscal  since being acquired on july  
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for corporate officers and finance and human resources personnel  and legal  accounting and consulting costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased costs  including costs of personnel  to support the continuing development of the company 
amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets 
in fiscal  we recorded expense of million  an increase of million from fiscal  for amortization of acquisition related intangible assets  including goodwill  purchased technology and established workforce 
these assets were acquired as part of the acquisitions of telinnovation  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and of atmosphere networks  in the first quarter of fiscal the basis for the allocation and expected amortization periods are detailed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
other income expense 
other income expense consists of interest income on our invested cash and cash equivalent balances  offset by interest expense attributable to our capital leases 
other income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the improvement was primarily attributable to increased interest income on funds invested from our initial and follow on public offerings completed in fiscal  and cash from operations 
despite a lower interest rate environment in fiscal  our larger average balances invested in fiscal contributed to an increase in interest income earned over that earned in fiscal income taxes 
income taxes consist of federal  state  and foreign income taxes 
our effective tax rate in fiscal was as compared to in fiscal the principal reason for the higher tax rate in fiscal is due to certain non deductible costs associated with our acquisitions  including purchased technology and the amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets 
those factors  which contributed to a higher effective tax rate in fiscal  were partially offset by the effect of having earned greater tax exempt interest income in fiscal stock based compensation we recorded deferred compensation of million as of april   as a result of stock options granted in fiscal we are amortizing the deferred compensation over the corresponding vesting period of the stock options 
we amortized approximately   and  of the deferred compensation to general and administrative expense in fiscal  and  respectively 
due to normal amortization and turnover in the workforce since the establishment of this deferred compensation in fiscal  the net remaining balance as of april  of  will be fully amortized to expense by the end of the third quarter of fiscal associated with the acquisition of telinnovation in february  we recorded million of deferred compensation related to  restricted shares granted to the telinnovation employees 
these restricted shares were tied to the employees continuing employment with ditech 
the deferred compensation was being amortized as research and development expense over the three year vesting period of the restricted shares 
we amortized approximately million  million and million of this deferred compensation in fiscal  and  respectively 
as part of the disposition of our echo software technology to ti  ti became the custodian of these restricted shares and will release them to the telinnovation employees  who now work for ti  as they are earned 
should a former telinnovation employee leave their employment prior to earning their restricted shares  the shares would be forfeited to ti 
since all former telinnovation employees have left our employment and are now working for ti  the net deferred stock compensation of million remaining on april  was eliminated as part of the sale transaction 
therefore  there will be no future amortization related to deferred stock compensation associated with our acquisition of telinnovation 
associated with the acquisition of atmosphere on july   we recorded million of deferred compensation related to unvested options assumed in the acquisition 
this amount has been reduced from time to time due to option cancellations associated with employee terminations 
this deferred compensation is being amortized to research and development expense over the remaining terms of the original twenty four month vesting period of the options 
in connection with the acquisition of atmosphere  we issued nonqualified stock options for approximately  shares of our common stock at a price equal to a discount from the market value of the stock on its grant date of august  the discount was recorded as deferred compensation of million in august subsequent to recording this deferred compensation in august  the gross amount of deferred compensation has been reduced from time to time for the impact of option cancellations due to employee terminations 
the net deferred compensation is being amortized to research and development expense over the remaining term of the original forty eight month vesting period of the options 
the atmosphere related deferred compensation expense totaled approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal the net remaining balance related to the assumed options of  will be fully amortized in the first quarter of fiscal and the net remaining balance related to the august option grant of million will be amortized over the remaining months of the original option term 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
and changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
upon adoption of sfas  amortization of goodwill  including goodwill recorded in past business combinations  will cease 
instead  goodwill will be tested annually or whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
we adopted sfas on may  based on the analysis done as part of our adoption of sfas  we believe that an impairment loss has occurred 
we are finalizing the amount of the impairment loss but expect that a write down of a substantial amount  if not all  of the goodwill balance of approximately million will be recorded upon adoption of the new standard in the first quarter of fiscal this loss is due to the continuing soft telecommunications market and the depressed values of telecommunications equipment provider stocks 
in addition  operating results will no longer include amortization of goodwill  which amounted to million in fiscal in august  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for periods beginning after december  sfas supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions relating to the disposal of a segment of a business of accounting principles board opinion no 
this statement retains many of the fundamental provisions of sfas and expands the scope of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on its financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources since march  we have satisfied the majority of our liquidity requirements through cash flow generated from operations  funds received upon exercise of stock options and the proceeds from our initial and follow on public offerings in fiscal in fiscal  we used million of cash in operations  primarily due to the operating loss for the year  net of non cash items including depreciation  amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles  amortization of stock compensation and the establishment of the million deferred income tax valuation allowance 
the other key cause for the use of cash was the increase of million in income taxes receivable  which was due to our expected recovery of over million of prior taxes paid  through the carryback of our current year losses 
these uses of cash were partially offset by reductions in accounts receivable and inventory and increases in accrued expenses and deferred revenue 
in fiscal  we generated million in cash from operations  primarily due to operating profits  after including the impact of non cash items  and to a lesser extent due to a reduction in accounts receivable 
these net sources of cash were partially offset by net uses of cash for increases in inventory and other current assets and reductions in accounts payable and deferred revenue balances 
in fiscal we generated million in cash from operations  primarily due to increased operating profits  increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenue  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable  inventories and other current assets 
in fiscal  investing activities generated million of cash due to million of net cash received from the sale of our echo cancellation software technology and related assets 
the sale was partially offset by increased purchases of property and equipment to support the growth in staff and the development and introduction of titanium 
in fiscal  investing activities used million  mostly for the purchase of property and equipment  offset somewhat by a net source of cash of  resulting from our purchase the net assets of atmosphere networks in july investing activities used million in fiscal  with million used to purchase our echo technology from telinnovation  and the balance primarily relating to purchases of equipment 
in fiscal  we generated million in financing activities  primarily due to the proceeds from shares issued under employee stock plans 
in fiscal we used million in financing activities  primarily due to the retirement in the second quarter of fiscal of approximately million in notes payable and capital lease obligations assumed in the atmosphere acquisition  partially offset by approximately million from issuance of stock under our stock option plans and employee stock purchase plans 
in fiscal we generated million of cash from financing  primarily from the net proceeds from our initial public offering in june and our secondary offering in october  partially offset by the redemption of series a preferred stock  retirement of long term debt  and principal payments on our capital leases 
as of april   we had cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to million at april  we have no material commitments other than obligations under operating leases  particularly our facility leases see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements and normal purchases of inventory  capital equipment and operating expenses  such as materials for research and development and consulting 
we currently occupy approximately  square feet in the two buildings that form our mountain view headquarters 
this facility lease expires in june we also lease a research and development facility in australia and on in the united kingdom  each of which contains approximately  square feet with lease terms that expire in april and october  respectively 
we believe that the space under the combined leases is adequate to meet our needs for at least the next twelve months 
the annual rental payments for these lease commitments are approximately million per year for each of the next four fiscal years and approximately million in total  thereafter 
we had less than million of open purchase orders related to purchases of inventory  capital equipment and operating expenses substantially all of which will be received over the next to months 
we believe that we will be able to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months from our existing cash and recovery of income taxes receivable 
we are also in preliminary discussions with a bank to provide a line of credit and equipment line to provide an alternative source of funds  if needed 
our ability to fund our operations beyond the next twelve months will be dependent on the acceptance of our new titanium product and the overall demand of the telecommunications providers for new capital equipment 
should our customers capital spending patterns not recover by the end of fiscal  we could need to find additional sources of cash during fiscal or look to reductions in spending to protect our cash reserves 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to our allowance for bad debts  provisions for inventories  warranties  valuation and impairment of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets and recovery of deferred income taxes receivable 
estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual future results may differ from these estimates in the event that facts and circumstances vary from our expectations 
to the extent there are material differences between our ongoing estimates and the ultimate actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we generally recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of a definitive agreement exists  shipment to the customer has occurred  title and all risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  acceptance terms  if any have been fulfilled  no significant contractual obligations remain outstanding  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
if any of these conditions are not satisfactorily met  revenue from that transaction is deferred until all conditions are met 
we offer a warranty  ranging from one year to five years  on all of our products 
the warranty generally provides that we will repair or replace any defective product within one year to five years from the invoice date 
we accrue for warranty costs at the time we recognize product revenue  based on our historical experience and expectations of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual will increase resulting in a decrease in gross profits 
allowance for bad debts 
we maintain allowances for bad debts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate suddenly  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
provision for inventory valuation 
we provide valuation allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on our ongoing assessment of inventory levels as compared to our estimates of future market demand and market conditions 
to the extent that a severe  unexpected decline in forecasted demand occurs  significant charges for excess inventory could occur  such as the million charge recorded in the third quarter of fiscal valuation and impairment of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets 
the purchase combinations carried out by us require management to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the combinations 
these estimates of fair value are based on our business plan for the entities acquired including planned redundancies  use of assets acquired and assumptions as to ultimate resolution of obligations assumed for which no future benefit will be received 
for example  with the atmosphere acquisition  we identified vacated or redundant facilities that we eliminated 
should actual use of assets or resolution of obligations differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimates would be required 
if a change in estimate were to occur beyond one year from the date of the acquisition  the change would be recorded in our statement of operations rather than as an adjustment to goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we determine that the carrying amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles may not be recoverable  based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
as previously discussed  the review and measurement of any future impairment of goodwill will be done in compliance with sfas no 
adoption of this new standard will result in elimination of goodwill amortization  which totaled million in fiscal accounting for income taxes 
we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as valuation allowances for bad debts and inventory  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences along with net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is no longer more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
at april   we determined that a valuation allowance against our then existing deferred tax asset position was necessary 
we based this decision on the fact that in the fourth quarter of  we generated sufficient operating losses on a tax basis to fully recover all taxes paid in prior years 
in addition  the sale of our echo canceller software technology and software generated such large loss carry forwards for tax purposes  that we could not conclude that the recovery of our deferred tax assets was still more likely than not 
should we be able to demonstrate a track record of sustained profitability in the future  some or all of the valuation allowance established in april could be reversed which would have a favorable impact on our tax rates in the quarter of adjustment 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and the liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
future growth and operating results subject to risk our business and the value of our stock are subject to a number of risks  which are set out below 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected  which would likely have a corresponding impact on the value of our common stock 
these risk factors should be carefully reviewed 
we depend on a limited number of customers for our products  the loss of any one of which could cause our revenue to decrease 
our revenue historically has come from a small number of customers 
a customer may stop buying our products or significantly reduce its orders for our products for a number of reasons  including the acquisition of a customer by another company or a delay in a scheduled product introduction 
if this happens  our revenue could be greatly reduced  which would materially and adversely affect our business 
our five largest customers accounted for over  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
for example  qwest  our largest customer for the past few years  accounted for only of our sales in fiscal  a time period in which revenues were substantially less than in recent prior periods  as compared to and of our revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
as another example of this risk  in the third quarter of fiscal  delays in scheduled shipments of our new oc echo cancellation products to qwest resulted in our revenues from qwest declining to of total revenue in that fiscal quarter 
additionally  due to continuing difficult economic conditions  many operators in the telecommunications industry have experienced financial difficulties  dramatically reducing their capital expenditures and  in some cases  resulting in their filing for bankruptcy or becoming acquired by other operators 
we expect this trend to continue  which may result in our dependence on an even smaller customer base 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past  and we anticipate that they may continue to do so in the future  which could adversely affect our stock price 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate in the future as a result of several factors  some of which are outside of our control 
if revenue declines in a quarter  as we experienced in the second half of fiscal and again in the second quarter of fiscal  our operating results will be adversely affected because many of our expenses are relatively fixed 
in particular  sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses do not change significantly with variations in revenue in a quarter 
adverse changes in our operating results could adversely affect our stock price 
our revenue may vary from period to period 
factors that could cause our revenue to fluctuate from period to period include changes in capital spending in the telecommunications industry and larger macroeconomic trends  the timing or cancellation of orders from  or shipments to  existing and new customers  delays outside of our control in obtaining necessary components from our suppliers  delays outside of our control in the installation of products for our customers  the timing of new product and service introductions by us  our customers  our partners or our competitors  competitive pressures  variations in the mix of products offered by us  and variations in our sales or distribution channels 
in particular  sales of our echo cancellation products  which historically have accounted for the vast majority of our revenue  have typically come from our major customers ordering large quantities when they deploy a switching center 
consequently  we may get one or more large orders in one quarter from a customer and then no orders in the next quarter 
as a result  our revenue may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our customers may delay orders for our existing products in anticipation of the release of our or our competitors new products 
further  if our or our competitors new products substantially replace the functionality of our existing products  our existing products may become obsolete  and we could be forced to sell them at reduced prices or even at a loss 
revenue can vary period to period if planned dates of new product introductions are missed and the product release occurs in a later quarter 
as an example of this risk  we had initially planned to begin production shipment of the international version of our oc echo canceller  the stm  in the second quarter of calendar however due to our schedule delays and prolonged customer testing of this new product  we did not ship any units for revenue in fiscal we expect our first production shipment will now occur in the first half of fiscal in addition  the sales cycle for our products are typically lengthy 
before ordering our products  our customers perform significant technical evaluations  which typically last up to days in the case of our echo cancellation products and up to days in the case of our optical communications products 
once an order is made  delivery times can vary depending on the product ordered  with delivery times for optical communications products exceeding those for our echo cancellation products 
as a result  revenue forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter may not occur in that quarter 
because of the potential large size of our customers orders  this would adversely affect our revenue for the quarter 
our expenses may vary from period to period 
many of our expenses do not vary with our revenue 
factors that could cause our expenses to fluctuate from period to period include the extent of marketing and sales efforts necessary to promote and sell our products  the timing and extent of our research and development efforts  the availability and cost of key components for our products  and the timing of personnel hiring 
if we incur such additional expenses in a quarter in which we do not experience increased revenue  our profitability would be adversely affected and we may even incur losses for that quarter  as we have continued to experience since the third quarter of fiscal we anticipate that average selling prices for our products will decline in the future  which could adversely affect our profitability 
we expect that the price we can charge our customers for our products will decline as new technologies become available and as competitors lower prices either as a result of reduced manufacturing costs or a strategy of cutting margins to achieve or maintain market share 
as a result  we may face reduced profitability and perhaps losses in future periods 
we expect price reductions to be more pronounced in the market for our echo cancellation products  at least in the near term  due to more established competition for these products 
while we intend to reduce our manufacturing costs in an attempt to maintain our margins and to introduce enhanced products with higher selling prices  we may not execute these programs on schedule 
in addition  our competitors may drive down prices faster or lower than our planned cost reduction programs 
even if we can reduce our manufacturing costs  many of our operating costs will not decline immediately if revenue decreases due to price competition 
if we do not successfully develop and introduce our new products  our products may become obsolete 
we operate in an industry that experiences rapid technological change  and if we do not successfully develop and introduce our new products and our existing products become obsolete due to product introductions by competitors  our revenues will decline 
our ability to maintain and increase revenue in the future will depend primarily on continued acceptance of our broadband and oc echo cancellation systems and of our quasar and orion optical subsystems  our successful introduction of stm and a next generation echo cancellation system  and our successful introduction of titanium  our new optical system product 
however  we may not be able to successfully produce or market our new products in commercial quantities  complete product development when anticipated  or increase sales 
these risks are of particular concern when a new generation product is introduced 
as a result  while we believe we will achieve our product introduction dates  they may be delayed 
for example  we originally expected our international version of our fifth generation echo cancellation system  the stm  to be available in the second quarter of calendar we now expect production shipments of the stm to occur in the first half of fiscal additionally  in fiscal  sales of our fourth generation echo cancellers and our broadband system have generated the majority of our echo revenue while sales of our fifth generation  oc  echo cancellation system fell short of our expectations due to a sudden decline in projected demand in the second quarter of fiscal from our primary targeted customer for this product  qwest 
additionally  we have invested heavily in the development of our titanium product and  if we are unable to introduce it or introduction is delayed due to technical or other difficulties  including the inability to obtain components on a timely basis  or it does not achieve market acceptance due to the weak economic conditions and capital spending in the telecommunications industry  then we would not be able to recover our costs in developing this product 
we do not anticipate any revenue from our new titanium system prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  depending on telecommunications carrier spending  timing of trials and acceptance criteria  which could affect revenue recognition 
delays in shipping titanium would adversely affect revenues in fiscal we have in the past experienced  and in the future may experience  similar unforeseen delays in the development of our new products 
we must devote a substantial amount of resources in order to develop and achieve commercial acceptance of our new echo cancellation and optical communications and optical systems products 
we may not be able to address evolving demands in these markets in a timely or effective way 
even if we do  customers in these markets may purchase or otherwise implement competing products 
if we are not able to develop substantial revenue from sales of our optical communications products  our ability to grow our business may be substantially impaired 
to date  the majority of our revenue has been derived from sales of our echo cancellation products 
if we are not able to develop substantial revenue from sales of our optical communications products  our ability to grow our business may be substantially impaired due to the relatively small size of the overall echo cancellation market as compared to the optical market 
we derived approximately  and of our revenue from the sale of our echo cancellation products in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect that a majority of our revenue will continue to come from sales of our echo cancellation products for the foreseeable future 
to date  the vast majority of our optical revenue has come from a few customers  one of whom is located in the far east 
due to our dependence on such a small number of optical customers at this time and the political and economic volatility in certain parts of the far east  our optical revenue could be subject to abrupt and unanticipated changes in demand 
until we can diversify our optical revenue stream  both in terms of customer and geographic mix  we may experience unexpected adverse swings in optical revenue from quarter to quarter 
we face intense competition  which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase sales of our products 
the markets for our echo cancellation and optical communications products are intensely competitive  continually evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors  including our customers 
certain of our customers also have the ability to internally produce the equipment that they currently purchase from us 
in such cases  we also compete with their internal product development capabilities 
we expect that competition in each of the echo cancellation and optical networking markets will increase in the future 
we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  manufacturing  distribution and support capabilities to compete successfully 
in our echo cancellation business  we face competition from two major direct competitors  tellabs and nms 
the other competition in the echo cancellation market comes from voice switch manufacturers 
these manufacturers don t sell echo cancellation products or compete in the open echo cancellation market  but they integrate echo cancellation functionality within their switches  either as hardware modules or as software running on chips 
the current trend in the customer base carriers is not to deploy echo cancellation within voice switches  and thereby favor external echo cancellation solutions  a reversal of this trend and a widespread adoption of internal echo cancellation solutions could present a competitive threat to us if the net result was the elimination of demand for our echo cancellation system products 
with the down turn in spending in the telecommunications industry  service providers appear to be exploring these alternative sources of echo cancellation more thoroughly  while they wait for more robust capital spending budgets to return 
if our customers decide to design these alternative sources of echo cancellation into their future network expansion  it could adversely impact the speed and duration of our echo sales recovery 
in our nascent optical systems business  new technology breakthroughs by our competitors may impact acceptance of our product in the market and future revenues 
most of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater name recognition and technical  financial and marketing resources than we do 
such competitors may undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to developing new products than we will 
for more information on the competition we face  see item business competition 
if we do not retain key personnel from acquisitions  we may not be able to realize the benefits we expect from our acquisitions 
we believe the atmosphere acquisition provides us with expanded opportunities in the rapidly growing optical communications market 
however  our ability to successfully execute in this new market is greatly dependent on our ability to retain key personnel 
although we believe that we have provided significant incentives directly linked to continued employment  there is no guarantee that these key employees will remain in our employment until after we have successfully penetrated these markets 
we now license our echo cancellation software from ti  and if we do not receive the level of support we expect from ti  it could adversely affect our echo cancellation systems business 
in april  we sold our echo cancellation software technology and future revenue streams from our licenses of technology acquired from telinnovation to ti  in return for cash and a long term license of the echo cancellation software 
although the licensing agreement has strong guarantees of support for the software used in our products  if ti were to breach that agreement in some fashion  and not deliver complete and timely support to us  this could adversely affect our success in the echo cancellation systems business 
if ti licenses its echo cancellation software to other echo cancellation systems companies  this could increase the competitive pressures on our echo cancellation systems business 
under the terms of the sale agreement of our echo cancellation software to ti  ti is precluded from licensing the software to other echo cancellation systems companies for a period of two years and four years to nms and tellabs 
if ti were to license its echo cancellation software to other echo cancellation systems companies after two years  this could increase the level of competition and adversely affect our success in our echo cancellation systems business 
if we do not reduce manufacturing costs of our products to respond to anticipated decreasing average selling prices  our ability to generate profits could be adversely affected 
in order to respond to increasing competition and our anticipation that average selling prices will decrease  we are attempting to reduce manufacturing costs of our new and existing products 
if we do not reduce manufacturing costs and average selling prices decrease  our operating results will be adversely affected 
we may not be able to successfully reduce the cost of manufacturing our products due to a number of factors  including we rely on a limited source of manufacturing 
manufacturing of our echo cancellation products and the electronic printed circuit board assemblies for our optical networking products is currently outsourced to a small number of contract manufacturers 
we believe that our current contract manufacturing relationships provide us with competitive manufacturing costs for our products 
however  if we or these contract manufacturers terminate any of these relationships  or if we otherwise establish new relationships  we may encounter problems in the transition of manufacturing to another contract manufacturer  which could temporarily increase our manufacturing costs and cause production delays 
we have no commercial manufacturing experience with our new products 
to date we have manufactured our newer optical communications products in our facilities but not in commercial quantities 
we will need to outsource the manufacturing of these products once we begin to commercially manufacture them 
we may experience delays and other problems during the transition to outsourcing the manufacture of these products 
we operate in an industry experiencing rapid technological change  which may make our products obsolete 
our future success will depend on our ability to develop  introduce and market enhancements to our existing products and to introduce new products in a timely manner to meet our customers requirements 
the echo cancellation and optical communications markets we target are characterized by rapid technological developments  frequent enhancements to existing products and new product introductions  changes in end user requirements  and evolving industry standards 
we may not be able to respond quickly and effectively to these rapid changes 
the emerging nature of these products and their rapid evolution will require us to continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our products  particularly in response to competitive product offerings 
we may not be able to respond quickly and effectively to these developments 
the introduction or market acceptance of products incorporating superior technologies or the emergence of alternative technologies and new industry standards could render our existing products  as well as our products currently under development  obsolete and unmarketable 
in addition  we may have only a limited amount of time to penetrate certain markets  and we may not be successful in achieving widespread acceptance of our products before competitors offer products and services similar or superior to our products 
we may fail to anticipate or respond on a cost effective and timely basis to technological developments  changes in industry standards or end user requirements 
we may also experience significant delays in product development or introduction 
in addition  we may fail to release new products or to upgrade or enhance existing products on a timely basis 
we may need to modify our products as a result of changes in industry standards 
the emergence of new industry standards  whether through adoption by official standards committees or widespread use by service providers  could require us to redesign our products 
if such standards become widespread  and our products are not in compliance  our current and potential customers may not purchase our products 
the rapid development of new standards increases the risk that our competitors could develop and introduce new products or enhancements directed at new industry standards before us 
if incumbent and emerging competitive service providers and the telecommunications industry as a whole experience a continued downturn or reduction in growth rate  the demand for our products will decrease  which will adversely affect our business 
we recently have experienced  as have other companies in our sector  an unexpected slowdown in infrastructure spending by our customers 
this recent trend of lower capital spending in the telecommunications industry contributed to the decline in our revenues  beginning in the second half of fiscal and continuing to the present 
if this trend continues  it will continue to have a negative effect on our operating results 
our success will depend in large part on continued development and expansion of voice and data communications networks 
we are subject to risks of growth constraints due to our current and planned dependence on emerging competitive and privatized overseas service providers 
these potential customers may be constrained for a number of reasons  including their limited capital resources  changes in regulation and consolidation 
some of the key components used in our products are currently available only from sole sources  the loss of which could delay product shipments 
we rely on certain vendors as the sole source of certain key components that we use in our echo cancellation and optical communications products 
we have no guaranteed supply arrangements with these vendors 
any extended interruption in the supply of these components would affect our ability to meet scheduled deliveries of our echo cancellation products to customers 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of these components  we could experience difficulties in obtaining alternative sources or in altering product designs to use alternative components 
resulting delays or reductions in product shipments could damage customer relationships  and we could lose customers and orders 
some suppliers of key components may reduce their inventory levels which could result in longer lead times for future component purchases and any delays in filling our demand may reduce or delay our expected product shipments and revenues 
although we believe there are currently ample supplies of components for our products  it is possible that in the near term component manufacturers may reduce their inventory levels and require firm orders before they manufacture components 
this reduction in stocking levels could lead to extended lead times in the future 
if we are unable to procure our planned quantities of material from all prospective suppliers  and if we cannot use alternative components  we could experience revenue delays or reductions and potential harm to customer relationships 
an example of this risk occurred in the third quarter of fiscal as two vendors supplying us with components used in our oc product did not meet our total demand  which contributed to our revenue shortfall in that quarter 
we are investing in growing our business  which is diverting our management s attention from the day to day operations of our business and may reduce our ability to focus on future business opportunities 
we anticipate significantly expanding our business capacity to address potential growth in our customer base and market opportunities  due for the most part to our new titanium product 
expansion of our business may strain our management personnel  operations and resources 
growth in our customer base may require us to improve our predictions of what customers are likely to need and when they will need it  which may also place further strain on our sales and marketing personnel 
in response to the prolonged downturn in the telecommunications industry  we announced a headcount freeze at the end of the third quarter of this year  so any near term plans to capitalize on potential growth will need to be fulfilled by our existing personnel 
we may also experience problems in integrating new personnel into our corporate culture in light of the effects of tighter spending controls 
we may experience unforeseen problems as we diversify our international customer base  which would impair our ability to grow our business 
historically  we have sold mostly to customers in north america 
we are continuing to execute on our plans to expand our international presence through the establishment of new relationships with established international oems  value added resellers and distributors 
however  we may still be required to hire additional personnel for the overseas market and incur other unforeseen expenditures 
our planned expansion overseas may not be successful 
as we expand our sales focus further into international markets  we will face new and complex issues that we may not have faced before  such as expanded risk to currency fluctuations  manufacturing overseas and broadened import export controls  which will put additional strain on our management personnel 
in the past  substantially all of our international sales have been denominated in us dollars  however  in the future  we may be forced to denominate a greater amount of international sales in foreign currencies 
additionally  the number of installations we will be responsible for is likely to increase as a result of our continued international expansion 
in the past  we have experienced difficulties installing one of our echo cancellation products overseas 
in addition  we may not be able to establish more relationships with oems  value added resellers and distributors 
if we do not  our ability to increase sales could be materially impaired 
if we lose the services of any member of our senior management or key technical personnel  or are unable to retain or attract additional technical personnel  our ability to conduct and expand our business will be impaired 
we depend heavily on tim montgomery  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  and on other key management and technical personnel  for the conduct and development of our business and the development of our products 
recently  we have attempted to mitigate some of this risk through some key hires 
however  there is no guarantee that if we lost the services of one or more of these people for any reason  that it would not adversely affect our ability to conduct and expand our business and to develop new products 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our continued ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees  who are in great demand 
however  we may not be able to do so 
our ability to compete successfully will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights  which we may not be able to protect 
we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
nevertheless  such measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our echo cancellation and optical communications products 
in addition  employees  consultants and others who participate in the development of our products may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property  and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
in addition  we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in certain countries 
we may  for a variety of reasons  decide not to file for patent  copyright or trademark protection outside of the united states 
we also realize that our trade secrets may become known through other means not currently foreseen by us 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property  our competitors may be able to develop products that are equal or superior to our products without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights 
our products employ technology that may infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  which may expose us to litigation 
although we do not believe that our products infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties  third parties may still assert infringement or invalidity claims or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims against us 
such assertions could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims  we could incur significant costs in defending against such claims 
acquisitions and investments may adversely affect our business 
from time to time  we review acquisition and investment prospects that would complement our existing product offerings  augment our market coverage  secure supplies of critical materials or enhance our technological capabilities 
acquisitions or investments could result in a number of financial consequences  including potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  large one time write offs  reduced cash balances and related interest income  higher fixed expenses which require a higher level of revenues to maintain gross margins  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  and amortization expenses related to other acquisition related intangible assets and impairment of goodwill 
furthermore  acquisitions involve numerous operational risks  including difficulties in the integration of operations  personnel  technologies  products and the information systems of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  diversion of resources from our existing businesses  products or technologies  risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or limited prior experiences  and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments and our investment portfolio only includes highly liquid instruments 
as a result of the short term duration of the financial instruments in our investment portfolio  we do not believe that our financial instruments are materially sensitive to changes in interest rates 
our cash and cash equivalents as of april  of million all have maturities of days or less and bear an average interest rate of 
the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates the principal amounts of the underlying securities based on the short maturities of these financial instruments 
to date  substantially all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
as only a small amount of foreign bills are paid in currencies other than the us dollar  our foreign exchange risk is considered immaterial to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
