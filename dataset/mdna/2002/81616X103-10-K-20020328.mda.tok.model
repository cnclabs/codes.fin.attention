overview select comfort r is the leading manufacturer and retailer of premium quality  innovative adjustable firmness air beds and other sleep related products 
we generate revenue by selling our products through four complementary distribution channels 
three of these channels  retail  direct marketing and e commerce  are company owned and sell directly to consumers  while our wholesale channel sells to leading furniture retailers and the qvc shopping channel 
we record revenue at the time product is shipped to the customer  except when mattresses are delivered and set up by our home delivery employees  in which case revenue is recorded at the time the mattress is delivered and set up in the home 
we reduce sales at the time revenue is recognized for estimated returns 
this estimate is based on historical return rates  which are reasonably consistent from period to period 
if actual returns vary from expected rates  revenue in future periods is adjusted  which could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
the proportion of our total net sales  by dollar volume  from each of these channels during the last three fiscal years is summarized as follows year ended dec

 beginning of period opened closed end of period company owned stores include leased space within bed  bath beyond stores as of december   at december  and at january  we anticipate that the number of stores open will not change significantly in comparable store sales decreased increased by  and in  and  respectively 
sales volumes and comparable store sales were negatively affected by the downturn in economic conditions during as reflected by consumer confidence measures and lower volumes of mall traffic  and by world events late in the year 
sales are subject to some seasonal influences  with lower sales levels in the second quarter and heavier concentrations of sales during the fourth quarter holiday season due to increased mall traffic 
cost of sales consists of costs associated with purchasing materials and manufacturing our products 
cost of sales also includes estimated costs to service warranty claims of customers 
this estimate is based on historical claim rates during the warranty period 
because this estimate covers an extended period of time  a revision of estimated claim rates could result in a significant adjustment of estimated future costs of fulfilling warranty commitments  which could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
our gross margins are dependent on a number of factors  and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
these factors include the mix of products sold  the level to which we offer promotional discounts to purchase our products  the cost of materials and manufacturing and the mix of sales between wholesale and company owned distribution channels 
sales directly to consumers through company owned channels generally generate higher gross margins than sales through our wholesale channels because we capture both the manufacturer and retailer margins 
sales and marketing costs include advertising and media production  other marketing and selling materials such as brochures  videos  customer mailings and in store signage  sales compensation and store occupancy costs  and customer service and shipping and delivery costs to customers 
store opening costs are expensed as incurred and advertising costs are expensed at the time the advertising is run 
we evaluate our long lived assets  including store leaseholds and fixtures  based on expected cash flows through the remainder of the lease term after considering the potential impact of planned operational improvements and marketing programs 
expected cash flows may not be realized  which could cause long lived assets to become impaired in future periods and could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
store assets are written off when we believe these costs will not be recovered through future operations 
advertising spending during the last three fiscal years is summarized as follows in s year ended dec

 advertising    future advertising expenditures will depend on the effectiveness and efficiency of the advertising in creating awareness of our products and brand name  generating consumer inquiries and driving consumer traffic to our points of sale 
we anticipate that full year advertising spend levels in will be slightly higher than in general and administrative costs include all other costs not directly related to manufacturing  selling or marketing

 net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expense sales and marketing general and administrative store closing impairments total operating expenses operating loss other income expense  net loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net loss for  our goal was to return to profitability  driven by the following strategic priorities building consumer awareness  rightsizing our cost structure  expanding profitable distribution  and improving product quality  innovation and service levels 
during we implemented initiatives designed to bring our cost structure in line with our sales volumes  with the ultimate objective of making our core bed business profitable at sales volumes equal to those achieved in these cost reduction measures included closing one of three manufacturing plants  one of two call centers and consolidating two administrative offices  closing over under performing stores  reducing overall staffing  including approximately of field sales support and approximately of administrative staffing  discontinuing our catalog sales channel and deferring the rollout of our sofa sleeper product  restructuring our promotional programs and developing more efficient programs to utilize in store signage and customer fulfillment materials  and developing a program to resell returned products to targeted markets 
the successful implementation of these measures is a key reason why we returned to profitability in the second half of quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including increases or decreases in comparable store sales  the timing  amount and effectiveness of advertising expenditures  any changes in sales return rates or warranty experience  the timing of new store openings and related expenses  net sales contributed by new stores  competitive factors  any disruptions in supplies or third party delivery services and general economic conditions and consumer confidence 
furthermore  a substantial portion of net sales is often realized in the last month of a quarter with such net sales frequently concentrated in the last weeks or days of a quarter  due in part to our promotional schedule 
as a result  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner and our business  financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 
our historical results of operations may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for any future fiscal period

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments and long term debt 
the counterparties to our investment agreements consist of government agencies and various major corporations of high credit standing 
we do not believe there is significant risk of non performance by these counterparties because we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution and any one type of investment 
our notes and debt bear interest rates that are fixed and not subject to market interest rate fluctuations 
our notes and debt are not subject to any early call provisions 
we are subject to financial covenants on our debt that require us to maintain minimum cash flow from operations 
we were in compliance with those covenants at year end and anticipate that we will meet covenant requirements for the foreseeable future
