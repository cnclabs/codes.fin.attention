improve profitability and cash flow 
we continually review our operations in order to ensure that we are optimally allocating our resources and have an appropriate cost structure that will enable us to grow our net sales  profitability  and free cash flow 
we recently completed a thorough review of our operations  which led to the planned closure of unprofitable stores of which had been closed as of february  and are under contract for sale  personnel reductions at the corporate and store levels  certain store operating expense reductions  and a reprofiling of our store inventory designed to maximize revenues by increasing our inventory turns 
we refer to this program as our profitability enhancement program  or pep 
store operations our stores are divided into eight geographic regions southwest  rocky mountain  northwest  northern plains  southern california  coastal california  los angeles  and northern california 
each region is administered by a regional manager  each of whom oversees seven to eleven district managers 
each of our district managers has responsibility for between and stores

store growth our store growth is focused on our existing or contiguous markets and includes opening new stores  relocating smaller stores to larger stores at better locations  and expanding selected stores 
our market strategy group  which is a part of our real estate department  utilizes a sophisticated  market based approach that identifies and analyzes potential store locations based on detailed demographic and competitive studies 
these demographic and competitive studies include analysis of population density  growth patterns  age  per capita income  vehicle traffic counts and the number and type of existing automotive related facilities  such as automotive parts stores and other competitors within a pre determined radius of the potential new location 
these potential locations are compared to our existing locations to determine opportunities for opening new stores and relocating or expanding existing stores 
the following table sets forth our store development activities during the periods indicated fiscal year beginning stores new stores relocated stores acquired stores closed stores including relocated stores ending stores expanded stores total new  relocated and expanded stores 
table of contents we opened  relocated  or expanded stores in fiscal as compared to stores in fiscal we expect to open  relocate or expand approximately stores in fiscal store merchandising our store merchandising program  which classifies our product mix into separate categories  is designed to determine the optimal inventory mix at each individual store based on that store s historical sales 
we believe that we can improve store sales  gross profit margin and inventory turnover by tailoring individual store inventory mix based on historical sales patterns for each of the product categories 
as part of our profitability enhancement program  we completed a comprehensive review of slower selling items that meet neither current return criteria nor our objective for inventory turns 
this review has resulted in a plan to eliminate certain merchandise  and to transfer certain goods to stores that are turning them satisfactorily 
purchasing merchandise is selected from over suppliers and purchased for all stores by personnel at our corporate headquarters in phoenix  arizona 
no one class of product and no single supplier accounted for as much as of our purchases in fiscal our inventory management systems include the e trim buying system  which provides inventory movement forecasting based upon history  trend and seasonality 
combined with service level goals  vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions  the e trim buying system determines the timing and size of purchase orders 
approximately of the dollar value of transactions are sent via electronic data interchange  with the remainder being sent by a computer facsimile interface 
our store replenishment system generates orders based upon store on hand and store model stock 
this includes an automatic model stock adjustment system utilizing historical sales  seasonality and store presentation requirements 
we also can allocate seasonal and promotional merchandise based upon a store s history of prior promotional and seasonal sales 
our stores offer products with nationally recognized  well advertised brand names  such as armor all  autolite  ac delco  castrol  dayco  exide  fel pro  fram  havoline  mobil  monroe  pennzoil  prestone  quaker state  raybestos  stant  sylvania  turtle wax and valvoline 
in addition to brand name products  our stores carry a wide variety of high quality generic products 
because most of our generic products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers that produce similar brand name products that enjoy a high degree of consumer acceptance  we believe that our generic products are of a quality that is comparable to such brand name products 
commercial sales program in addition to our primary focus on serving the do it yourself consumer  we have significantly increased our marketing efforts to the commercial customer in the automotive replacement parts market 
the commercial market constitutes in excess of of the annual sales in the automotive aftermarket and is currently growing at a faster rate than the do it yourself market 
our commercial sales program  which is intended to facilitate penetration of this market  is targeted to professional mechanics  auto repair shops  auto dealers  fleet owners  mass and general merchandisers with auto repair facilities and other commercial repair outlets located near our stores 
we have made a significant commitment to this portion of our business and upgraded the information systems capabilities available to the commercial sales group 
in addition  we employ one district sales manager for approximately every five stores that have a commercial sales center 
a district sales manager is responsible for servicing existing commercial accounts and developing new commercial accounts 
in addition  at a minimum  each commercial sales center has a dedicated in store salesperson  driver and delivery vehicle 
we believe we are well positioned to effectively and profitably service commercial customers  who typically require a higher level of customer service and broad product availability 
the commercial market has traditionally been serviced primarily by jobbers 
recently  however  automotive specialty retailing chains  such 
table of contents as our company  have entered the commercial market 
the chains typically have multiple locations in given market areas and maintain a broad inventory selection 
we believe we have significant competitive advantages in servicing the commercial market because of our experienced sales associates  conveniently located stores  attractive pricing and ability to consistently deliver a broad product offering with an emphasis on national brand names

many of our current associates have passed the ase p test  a nationally recognized certification for auto parts technicians 
competition we compete in both the diy and difm markets of the automotive aftermarket industry  which is highly fragmented and generally very competitive 
we compete primarily with national and regional retail automotive parts chains such as autozone  inc and the pep boys manny  moe and jack  inc  wholesalers or jobber stores some of which are associated with national automotive parts distributors or associations  such as napa  automobile dealers  and discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive replacement parts  maintenance items and accessories such as wal mart stores  inc 
as the largest specialty retailer of automotive parts and accessories in the western united states  we believe we have certain competitive advantages over smaller retail chains and independent operators 
these advantages include our brand name recognition as a trusted source of automotive parts and accessories  our ability to make available a broad selection of products on a timely basis  marketing and distribution efficiencies due to economies of scale  and our advanced store level information and distribution systems  which are the result of our significant investments in recent years

the complaint seeks injunctive relief against all defendants and seeks treble damages on behalf of the individual auto parts dealers who are plaintiffs  plus attorneys fees 
the complaint alleges that the estimated average damage amount per plaintiff is  and more for those plaintiffs that are wholesale distributors and not simply jobbers before trebling 
we believe the suit is without merit and plan to vigorously defend it 
we  along with other defendants  filed a motion to dismiss and certain other procedural motions 
in october  the court granted the motions in part and denied them in part 
in march  the court entered an order separating discovery with respect to liability and damages and setting various discovery deadlines 
we do not currently believe that this complaint will result in liabilities material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

we currently and from time to time are involved in other litigation incidental to the conduct of our business

environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business  including those governing the handling  storage and disposal of hazardous substances  the recycling of batteries and used lubricants  and the ownership and operation of real property 
for example  under environmental laws  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances in soil or groundwater 
such laws often impose joint and several liability and liability may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the release of such hazardous substances 
we have recorded no liabilities to provide for the cost of environmental remediation activities  as we do not believe that we have incurred any such liabilities pursuant to the existing accounting literature 
at some of our acquired locations  automobiles are serviced in automotive service facilities that we sublease to third parties 
as a result of investigations undertaken in connection with such acquisitions  we are aware that soil or groundwater may be contaminated at some of these properties 
although there can be no assurance  based on current information and  in some cases  indemnities we obtained from the former operators of these facilities  we believe that any such contamination will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as part of our operations  we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with  for example  our oil recycling program 
we currently provide a recycling program for batteries and for the collection of used lubricants at certain of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third party vendors 
the batteries and used lubricants are collected by our associates  deposited into vendor supplied containers pallets and then disposed of by the third party vendors 
in general  our agreements with such vendors contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination that may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to off site properties including as a result of waste disposal and to our properties  when caused by the vendor 
we do not believe that compliance with environmental laws and regulations has had a material impact on our operations to date  but there can be no assurance that future compliance with such laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

ebitda represents net income loss before interest expense  income tax expense benefit  and depreciation and amortization expense 
while ebitda is not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an indicator of operating performance or an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity  it is included herein to provide additional information with respect to our ability to meet our future debt service  capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
adjusted ebitda reflects the impact of one time and special items that we believe are important in evaluating our results on a normalized basis

table of contents one time and special items in december  we completed a refinancing of our capital structure  which resulted in the elimination of scheduled bank debt amortization payments prior to the end of  the extension of debt maturities and enhanced liquidity 
we refer to this as the refinancing 
as a result of the refinancing  we incurred an extraordinary loss from the early extinguishment of our prior bank credit facility of approximately million net of an income tax benefit of million 
the impact of the refinancing is discussed in more detail under the discussion of liquidity and capital resources 
in fiscal  we changed our accounting policies to comply with a new accounting standard for start up expenses store pre opening costs 
store pre opening costs are now expensed as incurred 
previously  we had capitalized and deferred such costs and expensed them in the month the store was opened 
upon adoption of the accounting standard  we wrote off approximately million net of an income tax benefit of approximately million of pre opening expenses that had been deferred as of the beginning of fiscal this expense is reflected in the accompanying financial statements as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the discussion that follows includes several references to significant one time and special items that occurred during the period covered 
for purposes of internally evaluating our operating performance  we exclude ie  normalize the one time and special items from our results and evaluate them separately

in july  we implemented a profitability enhancement program to reduce costs  improve operating efficiencies and close under performing stores 
we refer to this as the pep and provide more detail in the following discussion 
we recorded a total of million in charges under the pep  including store closing and restructuring charges of approximately million and amounts charged to cost of sales of approximately million related to reduction in inventory values and costs associated with inventory review and disposal 
we also recorded million of other adjustments to prior estimates affecting the closed store reserve that were unrelated to the pep 

table of contents b 
in fiscal and we settled two separate but similar lawsuits 
the lawsuits sought overtime pay for personnel that we had believed were exempt from overtime because they were part of our store management 
our operating results reflect the costs of settlement of million and million 
we have changed the manner in which we compensate certain members of our store management to avoid similar litigation in future periods 
included in the fiscal charge is a reserve for certain other legal matters 
c 
in the fourth quarter of  we reached an agreement to sell certain of our stores that we had planned to close as part of the pep 
we had expected to leave the stores vacant and incur rents through the expiration of the contracted leases  or to incur rental costs while negotiating with potential sub tenants 
these costs are no longer expected and  accordingly  we reversed the store closing allowance for these sites 
results of operations in fiscal reflect a reduction in expenses of million resulting from this agreement 
d 
over the past several years  we have completed a series of acquisitions collectively  the acquisitions in april  we acquired allcar stores the allcar stores located in wisconsin and michigan from all car distributors  inc we refer to this transaction as the allcar acquisition 
we closed of the stores for a net total acquired of in october  we acquired al s auto supply and grand auto supply stores the aga stores located in california and the pacific northwest from paccar inc we refer to this transaction as the aga acquisition 
we closed of the stores for a net total acquired of of the closed stores  was relocated 
in september  we acquired automotive information systems  inc ais  a leading provider of diagnostic vehicle repair information 
we refer to this transaction as the ais acquisition 
in june  we acquired big wheel rossi stores the big wheel stores located in the northern plains states from apsco products company 
we refer to this transaction as the big wheel acquisition 
we closed of the stores for a net total acquired of of the closed stores  were relocated 
upon completion of each of the above acquisitions  we incurred direct and incremental expenses for the transition of acquired stores to our format 
these expenses included the cost of re merchandising acquired inventories  training employees  grand opening advertising to generate name brand awareness in new markets and other expenses 
these expenses were typically incurred for a period of approximately six months following the acquisition  and totaled million  million  and million 
e 
in fiscal  we incurred charges of million relating to a loss on disposition of certain fixed assets 
f 
two of our commercial customers declared bankruptcy  requiring us to provide discrete provisions for bad debts of million in and million in g 
in connection with the acquisitions  we identified certain stores in our existing chain for closure because they overlapped with better situated acquired stores 
we incurred related charges of million and million 
we also incurred other store closing costs of million for fiscal and  but have not identified these costs as special items because they were incurred in the normal course of updating and relocating stores to improve our business 
h 
as part of the re merchandising of inventories obtained in the acquisitions  we returned a significant amount of product to vendors because we did not support the product in our typical store mix 
in our purchase price allocation  we established the carrying values of these inventories with this plan in mind 
in fiscal  we incurred a non cash charge of million associated with the liquidation of remaining inventories that we were not able to return to vendors at the amounts we initially estimated 
i 
in connection with the acquisitions  we acquired automotive service centers 
the majority of these centers are adjacent or attached to existing retail stores and perform automotive maintenance and tire 
table of contents sales and service 
as of the end of the first quarter fiscal  we had exited the service center business as it required management experience that is not consistent with our core business operations  required human and financial resources better utilized in our retail and commercial operations  and did not allow us sufficient economies of scale to achieve required profitability 
to provide for an evaluation of normalized operations  we have eliminated net sales  cost of sales gross profit  and operating expenses associated with the automotive service centers during the period that we operated them in fiscal we ceased operations at the remaining service center in the first quarter of fiscal as the operations in fiscal relating to this service center were not material to the financial results  no adjustment relating to the acquired service centers has been made for fiscal summary of normalized results normalized financial results are summarized as follows fiscal year ended percent change february  february  january  vs

to evaluate sales levels  we have not included the rd week in for comparison purposes so as to evaluate consistent week fiscal periods across all years 
after such adjustment  net sales in were billion 
on this basis  net sales increased approximately million in over  and chain wide sales increased million in over much of the increase in over was due to the result of acquisitions  as explained below 
net sales include the results of all stores from the date opened or acquired 
we also evaluate results for comparable or same store sales  which include only those new or acquired stores that have been open for a full year in the preceding period 
stores that have been relocated are included in comparable store sales 
after adjusting for the rd week in  comparable store sales increased in over by and increased in over by 
commercial sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and by in over the million level in comparable store commercial sales excluding the rd week in increased in over  and in over  as a result of the continued expansion of our commercial sales program 
we have driven our comparable store sales growth by significantly expanding our commercial sales program  investing in state of the art store level information systems and distribution systems  which have enhanced our inventory management and our ability to make available to our customers an expanded selection of brand name products  re profiling our inventory to optimize our store specific product mix  making 
table of contents significant investments in in store improvements  relocating our under performing stores  and converting acquired stores to our operating format 
store acquisitions and changes in store count in addition to the acquisitions  we have opened new stores or relocated stores in existing markets in order to increase our marketing and distribution efficiencies and further solidify our market position 
we have also opened stores in new markets to increase the number of markets we serve 
as part of the pep  we identified under performing stores for closure  of which had been closed by fiscal year end and of which are under contract for sale 
the following is a summary of our store count activity over the past three years store count open at beginning of year stores opened excluding relocations stores acquired  net stores closed excluding relocations open at end of year stores relocated stores expanded the most significant impact on comparability of our sales over the period is the impact of the net stores obtained through the acquisitions 
the following is a summary of the impact of the acquisitions on our sales growth over the past three years net sales big wheel stores acquired june  net of closings aga stores acquired october  net of closings allcar stores acquired april  net of closings pre existing stores  net of store openings  closings  relocations and other impact of rd week in net sales normalized the increase in net sales from to of acquired stores excluding allcar and pre existing stores reflects the comparable store sales increase of approximately 
the increases in from as to sales at the allcar stores and in from as to sales at the big wheel and aga stores also reflect a full year of sales at these stores in the later years as opposed to a partial year of sales in the earlier years  which were the years in which the acquisitions occurred 
gross profit gross profit consists primarily of net sales less the cost of sales and warehouse and distribution expenses 
after normalizing adjustments for the impact of the pep in and other items in  our gross profit was approximately of net sales in and approximately of net sales in both and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by variations in our product mix  price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs  and vendor programs 
normalized gross profit margin for fiscal declined as compared to in large part due to the sell through of product obtained in connection with the acquisitions that was acquired without the benefit of our 
table of contents normal vendor allowances 
although we had anticipated that we would achieve at least gross profit margin levels in normalized gross profit for  we did not achieve this result because of lower than expected vendor volume purchase allowances and cash discounts during the year  due principally to lower than typical in stock inventory levels in the period 
we have historically utilized prompt payment and other cash discount programs offered by vendors 
because of the need to pay for the class action lawsuit settlement see note to the consolidated financial statements and the term loan amortization payments  we took efforts to retain cash during most of fiscal and did not take full advantage of the contractual vendor allowances 
in addition  our change of advertising strategy to emphasize promotional discounts through newspaper advertising to increase retail customer count had the effect of holding down the realized gross profit margin during the period 
operating and administrative expenses operating and administrative expenses are comprised of store payroll  store occupancy  advertising expenses  other store expenses and general and administrative expenses  including salaries and related benefits of corporate employees  administrative office occupancy expenses  data processing  professional expenses and other related expenses 
operating expenses also include the costs of store closing and restructuring costs including the pep  acquisition related transition and integration expenses  legal settlements  and certain other special items 
these amounts are not included in our normalized numbers  and are discussed separately in the notes to the tables comparing reported results to normalized results 
normalized operating and administrative expenses increased by approximately million to million  or of net sales  for fiscal from million  or of net sales  for the comparable period 
the increase relates to higher payroll related costs and increased advertising costs  partially offset by a reduction of expenses related to the stores closed as part of our pep program 
normalized operating and administrative expenses increased by million to million  or of net sales  for fiscal from million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase in operating and administrative expenses reflects an increase in store payroll expenses and associated benefits costs  increased store rent expenses and the incremental costs of new stores 
interest expense net interest expense for fiscal totaled million compared to million for the weeks of fiscal higher outstanding loan balances in fiscal increased interest expense by approximately million 
as a result of our refinancing  amortization of deferred financing fees increased in fiscal this added approximately million to interest expense in fiscal finally  due to our liquidity issues during the year  we incurred million in fiscal for vendor interest on accounts payable because we extended merchandise payment terms 
these increases in interest expense were offset by lower interest rates  which reduced interest expense by approximately million  and an approximately million reduction in interest expense associated with there being one less week in fiscal weeks relative to fiscal weeks 
interest expense for fiscal increased to million from million for the comparable period of fiscal  primarily due to the increased debt levels as a result of our acquisitions approximately million  higher variable interest rates approximately million  higher outstanding balances approximately million and an additional week of expense accrual during fiscal approximately million 
income tax expense income tax benefit for fiscal was million  reflecting the loss we incurred  compared to income tax expense of million for the fiscal period and million in expense in fiscal our effective tax rate was during fiscal  which was substantially consistent with the rate of in our 
table of contents effective tax rate of in fiscal was not representative of our typical rate as a result of certain permanent items and tax credits that were relatively higher in proportion to our income before income taxes than in other years 
the rate also decreased in as a result of a reversal of prior reserves no longer required 
profitability enhancement program pep during the second quarter of fiscal  we implemented our pep to reduce costs  improve operating efficiencies and close under performing stores 
as a result of the pep  we recorded total restructuring and other charges of million  which are detailed in the following paragraphs 
the table below summarizes the charges relating to the pep amounts recorded as store closing and restructuring charges reserve for store closing costs write down for impairment of store site costs and store related property and equipment reserve for workforce reduction other amounts recorded as charges to cost of sales provision for excess inventories actual costs incurred for inventory review and disposal store closing costs under the pep  we increased the store closing reserve by approximately million 
approximately million of the charge relates to the planned closure of stores based on several factors including market saturation  store profitability  and store size and format 
of these planned closures  were closed as of february  and stores were subsequently removed from the reserve as they are currently under contract for sale 
in addition  we recorded an increase to the reserve for prior years plans of approximately million relating to existing closed stores that have longer than anticipated vacancy periods as a result of the continued economic slowdown 
the pep charge also includes a million write down for impairment of leasehold improvements and other store related property and equipment  which has been recorded as a direct reduction of net property and equipment balances 
see store closures for further discussion regarding the events and decisions made that result in strategic store closing plans and the related impact on our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
other profitability enhancement program costs as a result of the consolidation of certain regional operations and general and administrative functions under our pep  we terminated employees and eliminated open positions 
the terminated employees worked primarily in human resources  information technology and real estate 
as a result of these actions  the restructuring charges included a provision for severance and benefits of approximately million 
we have also accrued other costs and charges incidental to the restructuring 
these costs include early termination fees for operating lease commitments and other asset impairments aggregating approximately million 

table of contents inventory and related charges we completed an inventory review to increase inventory turnover  provide an optimal inventory level at each store location  liquidate inventory not meeting our new asset return levels  and write down the inventory of the stores planned for closure 
as a result of the analysis  we elected to establish a reserve for excess inventories resulting from the decision to eliminate certain product lines and to liquidate inventory from closed stores 
in conjunction with this decision  a provision of million was recorded to reduce inventory values 
in addition  we incurred actual costs during the year of approximately million related to labor  warehouse and distribution  freight and other operating costs associated with the inventory review and disposal 
these costs are reflected as cost of sales in the accompanying statement of operations for fiscal expected impact of the pep based on the initiatives described above  we expect the pep to directly increase operating profit in fiscal by approximately million  in addition to indirect benefits resulting from improved inventory turnover 
the components of the increase are as follows in thousands expected operating profit impact operating loss of stores personnel reductions store operating expense reductions represents the elimination of operating losses for stores planned for closure 
represents the annual salaries and benefits for the terminated employees 
no expense reduction has been assumed for the eliminated open positions 
represents a reduction in our store based satellite communication costs and a reduction in operating expenses related to transportation services 
liquidity and capital resources refinancing during the third quarter of fiscal  we initiated our refinancing of our capital structure by issuing a million principal amount convertible subordinated note due september  in a private placement 
in connection with the completion of the refinancing  the note was converted into approximately million shares of csk auto corporation common stock at a conversion price of per share 
at the time of conversion  the accrued and unpaid interest of approximately million was converted to additional paid in capital 
in december  we completed the refinancing  which resulted in the elimination of scheduled bank debt amortization payments prior to the end of  the extension of debt maturities and enhanced liquidity 
in connection with the refinancing  we entered into a new three year million senior secured  asset based credit facility due in december and issued million of senior notes due the new three year million senior credit facility is comprised of a million non amortizing term loan and a million revolving credit facility with availability subject to a borrowing base formula 
interest on the million senior credit facility is approximately libor plus 
the effective interest rate on the million senior notes is approximately per annum  which includes the stated interest rate of  plus amortization of the discount of approximately million 
prior to the refinancing  during the second quarter of fiscal  we obtained million of additional funding under our prior senior credit facility and obtained amendments to that facility to permit the increased borrowing and to amend certain covenant restrictions relating to outstanding debt levels 
these funds were 
table of contents used to pay the million principal payment that was due on the prior senior credit facility on june  as a result of the increased borrowing and based on our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal  our ratio of debt to adjusted ebitda as defined in our prior senior credit facility and our interest coverage ratio as defined in our prior senior credit facility would not have been in compliance with corresponding covenants under our then existing senior credit facility 
accordingly  we negotiated a waiver to these covenants effective for the third quarter ending november  the proceeds of the refinancing  including the proceeds received from the issuance of the million convertible note  were used to refinance the indebtedness under our prior senior credit facility 
we anticipate meeting all required covenants under the new credit facility in fiscal overview of liquidity as of year end net current assets cash availability under revolving line of credit total liquidity our primary cash requirements include working capital primarily inventory  interest on our debt and capital expenditures 
due to the refinancing  we will not be required to make any debt amortization payments prior to december other than capital lease payments 
we intend to finance our cash requirements with cash flow from operations and borrowings under our new senior credit facility 
at february   we had net working capital of approximately million  an increase of million  or  compared to february  inventory levels were reduced slightly  to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal the increase in working capital primarily relates to the following million of current maturities on our prior senior credit facility outstanding at february  that were refinanced to long term consistent with our refinancing  a million decrease in accounts payable consistent with improved liquidity associated with our refinancing  and a million increase in accounts receivable consistent with increased vendor allowance programs 
at february   we had total liquidity cash plus availability under our existing revolving credit facility of approximately million 
our liquidity was limited by borrowing base calculations associated with our new senior credit facility 
the borrowing base formula is equal to the lesser of million and the sum of certain percentages of our eligible inventory and accounts receivable 
as a result of the limitations imposed by the borrowing base formula  at february  we could only borrow up to million of the total million facility 
accordingly  we have million of additional borrowing capacity that has not been included in our liquidity calculation but that may be  in the future  subject to the borrowing base calculation 
debt is an important part of our overall capitalization and we have been highly leveraged 
our total outstanding debt balances have increased to fund working capital requirements  however  our debt to equity 
table of contents ratio has improved 
in addition to providing liquidity  the refinancing significantly reduced our leverage  as shown in the following table 
as of year end debt  including capital lease obligations equity debt to equity ratio debt to equity ratio  assuming conversion of million in notes as part of the refinancing  during the fourth quarter of fiscal we sold to certain investors  including investcorp csk holdings lp  an affiliate of investcorp sa one of our principal stockholders  million in principal amount of convertible subordinated debentures due december and make whole warrants carried at million after discount for a beneficial conversion feature 
the convertible subordinated debentures are convertible into csk auto corporation common stock at per share subject to certain anti dilution adjustment provisions and other adjustments that may result in the issuance of additional shares of common stock of csk auto corporation under certain circumstances 
we will require conversion of the entire unpaid principal amount of the convertible subordinated debentures into approximately million shares of our common stock 
if these debentures had been converted by the end of fiscal  our debt to equity ratio at february  would have been as compared to at the end of the prior fiscal year 
the conversion of the convertible subordinated debentures is subject to certain conditions  including the effectiveness of a registration statement covering the resale of the stock to be issued  which is expected to be satisfied by may  interest on the convertible subordinated debentures is payable quarterly 
for the first quarterly interest payment  we elected to pay such interest in additional shares of csk auto corporation s common stock 
if the conditions to conversion are not satisfied  the convertible subordinated debentures will remain convertible at the option of the holders 
analysis of cash flows operating activities in fiscal  net cash used in operating activities was million compared to million provided by operating activities during fiscal the largest components of the change in cash flow from operations relate to a net loss of million during fiscal compared to net income of million during fiscal  a non cash provision during fiscal of million comprised of a million provision for write down of inventory and a million impairment of fixed and other assets primarily as a result of our pep  and a decrease in accounts payable of million in fiscal compared to an increase in accounts payable of million in fiscal due to our improved liquidity arising from our refinancing 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million of cash used in operating activities during fiscal the largest component of the change in cash flow from operating activities relates to our investment in inventories  where million of cash was used during fiscal compared to million used for such purposes during fiscal the decrease in inventories reflects the sell through  return to vendors or other disposition of inventories obtained in acquisitions and reduced inventory levels as a result of cost containment 
during fiscal  we finalized an agreement to settle the class action lawsuits see note to the consolidated financial statements brought by former and present california store managers and senior assistant managers seeking overtime pay under california law 
the amount of the settlement was approximately million which includes plaintiff s attorneys fees and costs and other miscellaneous expenses and was paid during the first quarter of fiscal the settlement was funded through our prior revolving credit facility 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we also reserved million for certain other legal claims 

table of contents of this amount  we paid million during fiscal and expect to pay the remaining million during fiscal investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled million for fiscal  compared to million used in fiscal  and million in fiscal the levels reflect million used in the big wheel  aga and ais acquisitions 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily the result of million less in capital expenditures  and the million investment in the partsamerica joint venture during fiscal in fiscal  we invested approximately million in capital expenditures  including new store fixtures and information systems hardware and software 
we invested million in fiscal we invested a greater amount in fiscal as part of the transition and integration of the acquisitions  and do not expect such levels to be required again in the near future 
we are budgeting approximately the same amount for capital expenditures for fiscal that we spent in  primarily for new stores 
we opened new  relocated or expanded stores in fiscal and expect to open  relocate or expand approximately stores in fiscal we anticipate that the majority of these stores will be financed under arrangements structured as operating leases that require minimal capital expenditures for fixtures and store equipment 
for the remainder of our planned new  relocated or expanded stores  we expect to spend approximately  per store for leasehold improvements 
in addition to capital expenditures  each new store will require an estimated investment in working capital  principally for inventories  of approximately  we made no acquisitions during fiscal nor do we anticipate any significant acquisitions during fiscal the table below details the cash paid and transition and integration costs incurred consisting primarily of grand opening advertising  training and re merchandising costs by fiscal year as a result of our acquisitions in thousands allcar aga ais big wheel other total fiscal year cash paid transition and integration fiscal year cash paid transition and integration fiscal year cash paid transition and integration total cash paid transition and integration financing activities net cash provided by financing activities totaled million for fiscal compared to million of net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal this increase primarily relates to our refinancing

however  substantially all of our store leases are operating leases with private landlords and provide for monthly rental payments based on a contractual amount 
the majority of these lease agreements are for base lease periods ranging from to years  with three to five renewal options of five years each 
certain store leases also provide for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of sales in excess of a stipulated minimum 
we believe that the long duration of our store leases offer security for our store locations without the risks associated with real estate ownership 
we currently have leases with a related party for our corporate headquarters and an adjacent parking lot 
previously we had entered into sale leaseback or other financing arrangements with related parties 
we believe that the terms of the transactions with the related parties were no less favorable than terms we may have been able to receive from independent third parties at the time of the applicable transaction 
we also believe that these transactions as a whole are not material to our financial statements 
for more information on related party transactions  refer to note of the consolidated financial statements 
historically  we had an arrangement with a real estate investment company  under which we would identify a location for a new store and then that company would acquire the property 
we would then build our new store and lease the store from the real estate investment company under an operating lease 
this arrangement expired on december  during fiscal  two stores  which were previously committed under this facility  were funded 
we do not plan on negotiating another similar facility and do not believe that such a lease facility is critical to our store development plans for fiscal based on the limited number of projected store openings and the availability of other alternative financing arrangements  including sale 
table of contents leaseback financing transactions directly with individual investors 
we funded our remaining new and relocated stores during fiscal under separate agreements with landlords and individual investors 
in order to facilitate an understanding of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  the following data is provided in thousands payments due by period within after total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total contractual obligations our commercial commitments consist of standby letters of credit totaling approximately million  of which million expires in and million expires in store closures on an on going basis  store locations are reviewed and analyzed based on several factors including market saturation  store profitability  and store size and format 
in addition  we analyze sales trends and geographical and competitive factors to determine the viability and future profitability of our store locations 
if a store location does not meet our required projections  it is identified for closure 
as a result of our acquisitions over the last several years  we have closed numerous locations as a result of store overlap with previously existing store locations 
to the extent possible  we negotiate with the landlord to cancel the lease or we sublease the store to a third party to reduce our future exposure 
we provide an allowance for estimated costs to be incurred in connection with store closures 
the allowance for store closing costs primarily consists of three components future rents to be paid over the remaining terms of the lease agreements for the stores net of estimated probable sublease recoveries  lease commissions associated with the anticipated store subleases  and occupancy expenses associated with the closed store vacancy periods 
such costs are recognized when a store is specifically identified  costs can be estimated and closure is planned to be completed within the next twelve months 
no provision is made for employee termination costs 
for stores to be relocated  such costs are recognized when an agreement for the new location has been reached with a landlord and site plans meet preliminary municipal approvals 
during the period that they remain open for business  the rent and other operating expenses for the stores to be closed continue to be reflected in our normal operating expenses 
the actual costs of relocating a store  such as transporting of inventories  are considered a normal operating expense and are not included in the store closing reserve 
as of february   we had a total of store locations and service centers included in the allowance for store closing costs 
of this total  locations were vacant  locations were subleased and locations were identified for closure but remained open as of year end 
future rents will be incurred through the expiration of the non cancelable leases  the longest of which runs through march during fiscal  we expect cash outflows related to these store locations of approximately million for rent on vacant stores  related occupancy expenses  leasing commissions and net shortfalls on cash rents from subleased locations 

table of contents activity in the provision for store closings and the related store closing costs for the three fiscal years ended february   including the pep  is as follows in thousands fiscal year balance  beginning of year store closing costs store closing costs  gross adjustments to prior plans revisions in estimates store closing costs  net purchase accounting adjustments big wheel rossi al s and grand auto supply total purchase accounting adjustments payments rent expense  net of sublease recoveries occupancy and other expenses sublease commissions and buyouts total payments balance  end of year during fiscal  we recorded the following charges gross store closing costs of million million from the pep relating to the identification of stores for closure  an adjustment to prior plans of million due to two stores previously identified for closure under our pep that were subsequently removed as they are currently under contract for sale  and revisions in estimates of million million for plan year  million for plan year and million for plan years prior to relating to existing closed stores that have had longer than anticipated vacancy periods as a result of the economic slowdown 
during fiscal  we recorded the following significant charges gross store closing costs of million relating to the identification of stores for closure million of which relates to a closure plan for our own stores that overlapped with the acquired aga stores  and purchase accounting adjustments of million relating to a closure plan of certain acquired aga stores 
during fiscal  we recorded the following significant charges relating to the identification of stores for closure gross store closing costs of million million of which relates to a closure plan for our own stores that overlapped with the acquired aga stores  an adjustment to prior plans of million million for plan year and million for plan year relating to costs for store closures that were accrued in previously established plans but withdrawn from our allowance due to subsequent improvements in the underlying economics of the store s performance or in the case of store relocation because we were unable to secure a previously identified site upon acceptable lease terms  and purchase accounting adjustments of million relating to a closure plan of certain acquired aga and big wheel stores 

table of contents on a store count basis  activity and the remaining number of stores to be closed are summarized as follows number of stores to be closed beginning stores plan stores balance to store count by fiscal year balance added amendments closed be closed at february   there were stores remaining to be closed under our store closing plans  comprised of the following stores in plan stores balance to store count by fiscal year of accrual closing plan amendments closed be closed stores under contract for sale during the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into an agreement to sell stores in texas 
the stores are being sold as they are in relatively remote locations that do not allow us warehousing and distribution efficiencies 
this transaction is scheduled to close in the second quarter of fiscal and is estimated to result in net proceeds of approximately million 
this sale is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations in fiscal risk factors affecting liquidity and capital resources sales trends our business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the highest sales occurring in the summer months of june through august overlapping our second and third fiscal quarters 
in addition  our business is affected by weather conditions 
while unusually severe or inclement weather tends to reduce sales  as our customers are more likely to defer elective maintenance during such periods  extremely hot and cold temperatures tend to enhance sales by causing auto parts to fail and sales of seasonal products to increase 
as a result of our refinancing  we were able to improve relationships with our vendors and eliminate many out of stock conditions that pressured our sales 
since the completion of the refinancing  our same store sales increases have been in the mid to high single digits 
in addition  our same store retail customer counts have become positive 
this improved sales performance reflects our improved inventory position and the generally favorable dynamics in the us automotive aftermarket sector 
considering our improved financial position  we expect fiscal net sales to increase by approximately to on a same store basis 
however  any unusual weather conditions  competitive pressures  or other adverse changes to our business could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
inflation we do not believe our operations have been materially affected by inflation 
we believe that we will be able to mitigate the effects of future merchandise cost increases principally through economies of scale resulting from increased volumes of purchases  selective forward buying and the use of alternative suppliers 

table of contents debt covenant compliance our new senior credit facility contains negative covenants and restrictions on actions by us and our subsidiaries including  without limitation  restrictions on indebtedness  liens  guarantee obligations  mergers  asset dispositions not in the ordinary course of business  investments  loans  advances and acquisitions  dividends and other restricted junior payments  transactions with affiliates  change in business conducted  and certain prepayments and amendments of subordinated indebtedness 
our new revolving credit facility requires that we meet certain financial covenants  ratios and tests  including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
a breach of the covenants  ratios  or restrictions contained in our new senior credit facility could result in an event of default thereunder 
upon the occurrence of such an event of default  the lenders under our new senior credit facility could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the new senior credit facility  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
if we were unable to repay those amounts  the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness 
if the lenders under the new senior credit facility accelerate the payment of the indebtedness  we cannot be assured that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness  which is secured by substantially all of our assets 
we are highly leveraged 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences on our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes 
a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of interest on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes 
we are substantially more leveraged than some of our competitors  which might place us at a competitive disadvantage to those competitors that have lower debt service obligations and significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do 
we may not be able to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and we may be more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business 
interest rates financial market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
interest earned on our cash equivalents as well as interest paid on our variable rate debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
our variable rate debt relates to borrowings under our senior credit facility  which is primarily vulnerable to movements in the libor rate 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below for a more detailed explanation about our variable interest rate risk 
critical accounting matters vendor rebate programs we enter into agreements with our vendors for allowance and rebate programs 
amounts earned are either tied to a contract period or recognized over the course of the fiscal year  or tied to purchase volumes and recognized as inventory is sold 
sliding scale rebates are often based on estimated purchase levels and collection is often completed over extended time periods  usually a fiscal quarter  but sometimes up to one year 
in exchange for rebates  we provide cooperative advertising and other marketing related services to vendors 
on an on going basis  we record allowances and monitor vendor relationships 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined utilizing the last in  first out lifo method 
the carrying value of the inventory exceeds the current replacement cost primarily as a result of the application of the lifo inventory method of accounting 
our costs of acquiring inventories through normal purchasing activities have been decreasing in recent years as our increased size has enabled us to take advantage of volume discounts and lower product acquisition costs 
on a quarterly basis  we perform an analysis of the net realizable value of inventory  after consideration of expected disposal costs and normal profit margins  to determine if the lifo carrying value of the inventory is impaired 
should an impairment be indicated  the carrying value of the inventory would be reduced 

table of contents periodic cycle counts are conducted at all store locations and warehouses and a complete physical count is conducted annually 
a provision for shrink  based on a percentage of net sales  is recorded every month and is adjusted based upon the actual physical count results 
our actual shrink expense has averaged approximately of normalized net sales over the last several years 
deferred tax asset we have recorded deferred tax assets of approximately million as of february   reflecting the benefit of federal and state tax loss carryforwards approximating million and million  which begin to expire in and  respectively 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss carryforwards 
utilization of certain of the net operating loss carryforwards may be limited under section of the internal revenue code 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  we believe that no valuation allowance is required for deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
legal matters we currently and from time to time are involved in other litigation incidental to the conduct of our business 
the damages claimed in some of this litigation are substantial 
based on an internal review  we accrue reserves using our best estimate of our probable and reasonably estimable contingent liabilities 
we do not believe that any of these legal claims  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  if our estimates related to these contingent liabilities are incorrect  the future results of operations for any particular fiscal quarter or year could be materially adversely affected 
store closing costs if a store location does not meet our required standards  it is designated for closure 
we provide an allowance for estimated costs and losses to be incurred in connection with store closures 
we establish this allowance based on an assessment of market conditions for rents  and include assumptions for vacancy periods and sublease rentals 
in  we were required to make adjustments to the allowance because actual market conditions were different than the assumptions we made at the time we established the allowance 
we may be required to make further adjustments in future periods 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb or the board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations  and no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  collectively referred to as the standards 
sfas supersedes accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 business combinations 
the provisions of sfas require that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   provide specific criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets apart from goodwill  and generally require that unamortized negative goodwill be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and amortized 
sfas also requires that upon adoption of sfas we reclassify the carrying amounts of certain intangible assets into or out of goodwill  based on certain criteria 
sfas supersedes apb  intangible assets  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition 
the provisions of sfas prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  require that goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles assets be tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangible assets may be impaired  require that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill  and remove the forty year limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have finite lives 

table of contents we will adopt the provisions of sfas in our first quarter ended may  we are in the process of preparing for our adoption of sfas and are making the determinations as to what our reporting units are and what amounts of goodwill  intangible assets  other assets  and liabilities should be allocated to those reporting units 
we expect that we will no longer record approximately million of amortization expense relating to our existing goodwill 
our intangible assets primarily consist of favorable leasehold interests 
as such  fas did not impact the useful lives assigned to our intangible assets 
sfas requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment and  in transition  this step must be measured as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
however  a company has six months from the date of adoption to complete the first step 
accordingly  we expect to complete that first step of the goodwill impairment test before the end of the second quarter of the second step of the goodwill impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss measured as of the beginning of the year of adoption  if any  and must be completed by the end of our fiscal year 
intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life will be tested for impairment using a one step process which compares the fair value to the carrying amount of the asset as of the beginning of the fiscal year  and pursuant to the requirements of sfas will be completed during the first quarter of any impairment loss resulting from the transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we have not yet determined what effect these impairment tests will have on our earnings and financial position 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
replaces certain previously issued accounting guidance  develops a single accounting model for long lived assets  and broadens the framework previously established for assets to be disposed of by sale whether previously held or newly acquired 
we adopted sfas no 
as of the beginning of fiscal the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
we hold no securities for purposes of trading 
interest earned on our cash equivalents as well as interest paid on our variable rate debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
our variable rate debt relates to borrowings under our senior credit facility  which is primarily vulnerable to movements in the libor rate 
our variable and fixed rate debt at february  consisted of the following in thousands average fixed interest or debt facility balance rate variable senior credit facility term  variable senior credit facility revolver  variable senior notes  fixed senior subordinated notes  fixed convertible subordinated notes  fixed capital leases  fixed total debt the coupon rate of these notes is  however the effective interest rate is due to the amortization of a discount of approximately million on the notes 
at the end of fiscal  of our debt had variable interest rates and had fixed interest rates 
with million in variable rate debt outstanding  a change in the libor rate to which this variable rate debt is tied would result in a million change in our annual interest expense 
this estimate assumes that our debt balances remains constant for an annual period and the interest rate change occurs at the beginning of the period 

table of contents during february  we entered into an interest rate swap contract to convert million of our senior notes to a floating rate  set quarterly  equal to the month libor basis points 
as such  based on our debt balances at february   of our debt is at variable interest rates and of our debt is at fixed interest rates 
the hedge is considered to qualify as a fair value hedge  accordingly  the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the underlying debt will be reported on the balance sheet 
based upon our assessment of effectiveness of the hedge  changes in the fair value of this derivative and the underlying debt are not expected to result in a material impact on net income 
our cost of funds is affected by a variety of general economic conditions  including the level and volatility of interest rates 
we try to manage this interest rate risk through the use of fixed and variable rate debt and the above mentioned interest rate swap 
currently we have no plans to refinance our existing debt structure  however a negative change in our debt rating could limit our ability to acquire needed funding or  at a minimum  would result in an increase in our cost of funds
