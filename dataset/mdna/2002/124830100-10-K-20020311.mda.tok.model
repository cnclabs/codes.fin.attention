jacobs group s interests in malls and two associated centers for total consideration of approximately billion  including the acquisition of minority interests in certain properties 
the purchase price is comprised of million in cash  including closing costs of approximately million  the assumption of million in primarily non recourse mortgage debt  and the issuance of  special common units of the operating partnership a value of per unit

accordingly  revenues and results of operations are disproportionately impacted by the malls achievements 
the shopping center business is somewhat seasonal in nature with tenant sales achieving the highest levels during the fourth quarter because of the holiday season 
the malls earn most of their temporary rents rents from short term tenants during the holiday period

except for these projects and as further described below  the company currently has no other capital commitments 
it is management s expectation that the company will continue to have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and grow its business 
future development and acquisition activities will be undertaken by the company as suitable opportunities arise 
such activities are not expected to be undertaken unless adequate sources of financing are available and a satisfactory budget with targeted returns on investment has been internally approved 
the company will fund its major development  expansion and acquisition activity with its traditional sources of construction and permanent debt financing as well as from other debt and equity financings  including public financings  and its credit facilities 
other capital expenditures management prepares an annual capital expenditures budget for each property which is intended to provide for all necessary recurring capital improvements and maintenance items 
management believes that its annual operating reserve for maintenance and recurring capital improvements as well as reimbursements from tenants will provide the necessary funding for such requirements 
the company intends to distribute approximately to of its funds from operations with the remaining to to be held as a reserve for capital expenditures and continued growth opportunities 
cbl associates properties  inc form k management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations major tenant finish costs for currently vacant space are expected to be funded with working capital  operating reserves  or revolving lines of credit 
funds invested for tenant finish costs are expected to earn a return on that investment 
for the year ended december   revenue generating capital expenditures  or tenant allowances for improvements  were million 
these capital expenditures generate a return through increased rents from these tenants over the term of their leases 
revenue enhancing capital expenditures  or remodeling and renovation costs  were million  the majority of which was for the renovation of burnsville center in minneapolis burnsville  minnesota and meridian mall in lansing okemos  michigan in the existing portfolio and fashion square mall in saginaw  michigan and cary towne center in cary  north carolina in the newly acquired portfolio 
certain items of revenue enhancing capital expenditures such as flooring and parking lot resurfacing are billed to tenants and a portion is recovered from tenants 
revenue neutral capital expenditures  such as parking lot and roof repairs  are billed to tenants and a portion is recovered from tenants 
during revenue neutral expenditures were million 
the billing and recovery of revenue neutral and certain revenue enhancing expenditures occurs generally over a to year period 
environmental matters the company believes that the properties are in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state and local ordinances and regulations regarding the handling  discharge  and emission of hazardous or toxic substances 
the company has not been notified by any governmental authority and is not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance  liability  or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances in connection with any of its present or former properties 
the company has not recorded in its financial statements any material liability in connection with environmental matters 
cash flows cash flows provided by operating activities for increased by million  or  to million from million in this increase was primarily due to increases in cash provided by the operations of thirty one new centers opened or acquired in the last twenty four months offset by decreases in cash flow from the sales of nineteen properties 
cash flows used in investing activities for increased by million  or  to million compared with million in this increase was primarily due to the acquisition of malls and two associated centers and capital investment in properties in compared with the smaller number of acquisitions and capital investment in cash flows provided by financing activities for increased by million  or  to million from million in this increase is primarily due to increases in the acquisition program 
impact of inflation in the last three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate 
substantially all tenant leases do  however  contain provisions designed to protect the company from the impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than ten years which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base and or percentage rentals if rents from the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
critical accounting policies in december  the securities and exchange commission requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting policies in md a 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and requires significant judgement or complex estimation processes 
management believes that the company s accounting policies that are the most significant and that require the most judgement are within its accounting for the development of real estate projects 
management believes that the following accounting policies within this process fit the definition described above 
the company capitalizes predevelopment costs paid to third parties incurred on a project 
all previously cbl associates properties  inc form k management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capitalized predevelopment costs are expensed when it is no longer probable that the project will be completed 
once development of a project commences  the company capitalizes all direct costs incurred to construct the project  including interest and real estate taxes 
in addition  certain general and administrative expenses are allocated to the projects and capitalized based on the personnel assigned to development and the investment in the project relative to all development projects 
once a project is completed and placed in service  it is depreciated over its estimated useful life 
buildings and improvements are depreciated generally over years and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lives of the applicable leases or the estimated useful life of the asset  whichever is shorter 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets collectively the standards 
the standards will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  companies with fiscal years beginning after march  may early adopt  but only as of the beginning of that fiscal year and only if all existing goodwill is evaluated for impairment by the end of that fiscal year 
sfas no 
will require companies to recognize acquired identifiable assets separately from goodwill if control over the future economic benefits of the assets results from contractual or other legal rights or the intangible assets is capable of being separated or divided and sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged 
the standards will require the value of separately identifiable intangible assets meeting any of the criteria to be measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
will require that goodwill not be amortized  and that amounts recorded as goodwill be tested for impairment 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill will be reduced if it is found to be impaired 
annual impairment tests will have to be performed at the lowest level of an entity that is a business and that can be distinguished  physically and operationally and for internal reporting purposes  from the other activities  operations  and assets of the entity 
the company believes the impact of the new goodwill impairment standards will not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and among other factors  establishes criteria beyond that previously specified in sfas no 
to be determine when a long lived asset is to be considered as held for sale 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective january  and is currently evaluating its impact 
funds from operations management believes that funds from operations ffo provides an additional indicator of the financial performance of the properties 
ffo is defined by the company as net income loss before depreciation of real estate assets  gains or losses on sales of real estate and gains or losses on investments in marketable securities 
ffo also includes the company s share of ffo in unconsolidated properties and excludes minority interests share of ffo in consolidated properties 
the company computes ffo in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit recommendation concerning finance costs and non real estate depreciation 
the company excludes gains or losses on outparcel sales  even though nareit permits their inclusion when calculating ffo 
gains on outparcel sales would have added million to ffo in compared with million in the use of ffo as an indicator of financial performance is influenced not only by the operations of the properties  but also by the capital structure of the operating partnership and the company 
accordingly  management expects that ffo will be one of the significant factors considered by the board of directors in determining the amount of cash distributions the operating partnership will make to its partners including the company 
management also believes that ffo is a widely used measure of the operating performance of reits and provides a relevant basis for comparison among companies 
ffo does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  is not necessarily indicative of cash from operations available to fund all cash flow needs  and should not be considered as an alternative to net income for purposes of evaluating the company s operating performance  for evaluating the impact of capital investments in the company s properties or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
effective january   nareit clarified ffo to include all operating results recurring and non recurring except those results defined as extraordinary items under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company implemented this clarification in the first quarter of and no longer adds back to ffo the write off of development costs charged to net income
