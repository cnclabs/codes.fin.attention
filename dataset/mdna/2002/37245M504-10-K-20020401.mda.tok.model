in this regard  effective march  the company significantly reduced its involvement with respect to genta jago  its owned r d joint venture 
the company also sold substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of the company s wholly owned specialty chemicals subsidiary jbl scientific  inc jbl for cash  a promissory note and certain pharmaceutical development services in support of genta s genasense tm development project in may during  the company ceased its european operations and liquidated genta europe  its european subsidiary

the following discussion of results of operations relates to the company s continuing operations summary operating results for the years ended december  increase increase thousands decrease decrease revenues license fees royalties costs and expenses research and development      general and administrative     promega settlement   equity related compensation      loss from operations      equity in net income of joint venture   other income     net loss from continuing operations      operating revenues consisting of license fees and royalties were 
million in compared to 
million in these revenues were derived from non exclusive sub license agreements involving antisense technology 
these agreements were initiated with atugen ag and epegenesis pharmaceuticals  inc in  and sequitur incorporated and oasis biopharmaceuticals  inc in the disposition of substantially all jbl assets in resulted in a significant decrease in ongoing revenues  as all of the company s historical product sales were attributable to jbl 
costs and expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in these increases reflect additional clinical trial activity and related drug supply  salaries and non cash stock compensation charges 
services and capabilities that have not been retained within the company are out sourced through short term contracts or from consultants 
substantially  all pre clinical biology and clinical trial work are now conducted through such collaborations with external scientists and clinicians 
the company anticipates that  if sufficient collaborative revenues and other funding are available  research and development expenses may increase in future years due to requirements for pre clinical studies  clinical trials  the genasense tm antisense oligonucleotide program and increased regulatory costs 
the company will continue to assess the potential cost benefit ratio of developing its own antisense oligonucleotide manufacturing  and marketing and sales activities if and as such products are successfully developed and approved for marketing 
research and development expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in the increase from through is due primarily to drug supply costs  investigator and monitor fees related to expanded clinical trials  along with increased patent amortization costs relating to intellectual property acquisitions in it is anticipated that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the future  as the development program for genasense tm expands 
furthermore  the company is also pursuing other opportunities for new product development candidates  which  if successful  will require additional research and development expenses 
in an effort to focus its research and development on areas that provide the most significant commercial opportunities  the company continually evaluates its ongoing programs in light of the latest market information and conditions  availability of third party funding  technological advances  and other factors 
as a result of such evaluation  the company s product development plans have changed from time to time  and the company anticipates that they will continue to do so in the future 
general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in and million in such expenses do not include charges related to non cash equity related compensation 
the million increase from to reflects increased payroll costs associated with additional headcount and increased marketing expenses offset by reduced patent abandonment costs 
the company recorded charges to general and administrative expenses of 
million in to account for the carrying value of abandoned patents no longer related to the research and development efforts of the company 
the amounts recorded in and were immaterial 
the company s policy is to evaluate the appropriateness of carrying values of the unamortized balances of long lived and intangible assets on the basis of estimated future cash flows undiscounted and other factors 
if such evaluation were to identify a material impairment of these assets  such impairment would be recognized by a write down of the applicable assets 
the company continues to evaluate the continuing value of patents and patent applications  particularly as expenses to prosecute or maintain these patents come due 
through this evaluation  the company may elect to continue to maintain these patents  seek to out license them  or abandon them 
the company recorded charges to non cash equity related compensation of million in compared to million in and million in this decrease is primarily due to the acceleration of outstanding stock options for the four members of the company s board of directors who resigned in march note 
the company had no equity in earnings of its joint venture genta jago in compared to 
in and million in on march   skyepharma plc on behalf of itself and its affiliates entered into an interim agreement with genta the interim jv agreement pursuant to which the parties to the joint venture released each other from all liability relating to unpaid development costs and funding obligations of genta jago 
under the terms of the interim jv agreement  skyepharma plc assumed responsibility for substantially all the obligations of the joint venture to third parties as well as further development of the product line 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  earnings of the joint venture are to be allocated equally between the two parties 
accordingly  genta recognized 
million as its equity in net income of the joint venture during the first quarter of since the first quarter of  there have been no earnings or losses of the joint venture to be allocated between the two parties 
interest income has fluctuated significantly each year and is anticipated to continue to fluctuate primarily due to changes in the levels of cash  investments and interest rates during each period 
the company recorded a gain on the sale of marketable securities of approximately 
million in compared to million in  which reflects a non recurring gain on the disposition of securities in september genta exercised  warrants to purchase shares of common stock of cv therapeutics  inc cv 
these warrants  which were restricted and not traded  were issued to genta by cv in connection with a licensing arrangement entered into in the company received approximately million in cash upon the sale of such common shares 
recent accounting pronouncements the company has adopted all required statements of financial accounting standards issued subsequent to december   as more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
adoption of these standards did not or are not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in preparing our financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that  among other things  affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
these estimates are most significant in connection with our critical accounting policies  namely those of our accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments often result from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition 
the company s policy is to recognize revenues under license arrangements when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee has been determined to be fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
royalties are recognized when earned 
research and development costs 
all such costs are expensed or incurred  including raw material costs required to manufacture drugs for clinical trials 
intangible assets 
the company s intangible assets consist primarily of licensed technology and capitalized patent costs  and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
the company s policy is to evaluate the appropriateness of the carrying values of the unamortized balances of intangible assets on the basis of estimated future cash flows undiscounted and other factors 
if such evaluation were to indicate an impairment of these intangible assets  such impairment would be recognized by a write down of the applicable assets 
the company evaluates the continuing value of patents and patent applications each financial reporting period 
as a result of this evaluation  the company may elect to continue to maintain  seek to out license  or abandon these patents 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company has financed its operations primarily from private placements and public offerings of its equity securities 
cash provided from these offerings totaled approximately million through december   including net proceeds of million received in  million received in and million received in the company used million in operating activities during  resulting from a net loss of million  offset by non cash charges and improved working capital aggregating million 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million compared to million at december  management believes that at the current rate of spending  primarily in support of on going and anticipated clinical trials  the company will have sufficient cash funds to maintain its present operations into the first quarter of if the company successfully secures sufficient levels of collaborative revenues and other sources of financing  it expects to use such financing to continue to expand its ongoing research and development activities  preclinical testing and clinical trials  costs associated with the market introduction of potential products  and expansion of its administrative activities 
the company anticipates that significant additional sources of financing  including equity financing  will be required in order for the company to continue its planned operations 
the company also anticipates seeking additional product development opportunities from external sources 
such acquisitions may consume cash reserves or require additional cash or equity 
the company s working capital and additional funding requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including i the progress of the company s research and development programs  ii the timing and results of pre clinical testing and clinical trials  iii the level of resources that the company devotes to sales and marketing capabilities  iv technological advances  v the activities of competitors  and vi the ability of the company to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements with others to fund certain research and development efforts  to conduct clinical trials  to obtain regulatory approvals and  if such approvals are obtained  to manufacture and market products 
future minimum obligations at december  are as follows thousands operating drug purchase leases commitments thereafter total   item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s carrying values of cash  marketable securities  accounts payable and accrued expenses are a reasonable approximation of their fair value 
the estimated fair values of financial instruments have been determined by the company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies 
however  considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates utilized in the consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the company could realize in a current market exchange 
the company has not entered into  and does not expect to enter into  financial instruments for trading or hedging purposes 
the company does not currently anticipate entering into interest rate swaps and or similar instruments 
since the company has liquidated its genta europe subsidiary  the company has no material currency exchange or interest rate risk exposure as of december  with the liquidation  there will be no ongoing exposure to material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  or results of operation for sensitivity to changes in interest rates or to changes in currency exchange rates
