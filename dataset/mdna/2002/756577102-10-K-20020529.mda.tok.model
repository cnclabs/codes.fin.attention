overview red hat offers users a single  trusted point of contact and a common platform for developing  deploying and managing open source software across internet infrastructure and devices that connect to the internet  ranging from small embedded devices to high availability clusters and integrated web server e commerce operating systems 
red hat network  our unique management technology  helps companies efficiently manage their networks and systems by delivering open source products  services  support and information on line  in real time 
open source software is an alternative to proprietary software 
there are no licensing fees associated with open source software 
therefore  we do not recognize any separate distinguishable value from the sale of the code itself 
we derive the value from the sale of our open source solutions by the value we add through the integration and testing of open source technology and by the managed services we provide for our technologies through the red hat network 
we recognize our technology based revenue over the period of the technology subscription relationships with our customers 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop and sop  and staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
revenue recognition in accordance with these pronouncements can be complex due to the nature and variability of our sales transactions 
subscription revenue subscription revenue is comprised of enterprise and embedded revenues 
enterprise subscription revenue is comprised primarily of revenue from sales of red hat linux and related software solutions  software development tools  technical support and maintenance fees 
official red hat linux was released in october our current release is red hat which was first shipped in september we sell red hat linux software solutions through four channels retail distributors  direct sales  original equipment manufacturers oems and the web 
revenue recognition periods vary for each channel based on the subscription period with red hat that the end purchasers of the solutions from these channels receive with these solutions 
through our retail distributors  we sell official red hat linux products to our enterprise customers 
the product is currently offered in two versions standard and professional 
each version has various levels of red hat support and software applications provided 
during fiscal  we sold two different releases of red hat linux and 
we also provide certain support and subscription services with red hat linux for a period of time  not exceeding two months  from the date of registration of the software products for no additional fee 
as our technologies are all open source and freely available for download and use by others  a part of our value proposition is in the ability to provide the customer certain services that enhance the value of the technology 
in accordance with the provisions of sop  we recognize all of the revenue from the sale of red hat linux ratably over the period that the subscription services are provided 
a reserve for sales returns is recognized for sales of software products to distributors  who have a right of return  based on the company s historical experience of sell through to the end user by the distributor 
the return rate experienced by the company over its last three product releases has averaged 
the fee is fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are estimable 
our enterprise customers do not receive the right to future upgrades or new versions of our technology 
our subscription relationships with our large enterprise customers typically have contracts with multiple elements ie delivered and undelivered products  maintenance and other services 
we allocate revenue to each component of the contract based on objective evidence of its fair value  which is specific to us 
the fair value of each element is based on the price if sold separately 
subscription revenue also includes revenue from several large unix to linux migration arrangements 
revenue from these arrangements have been recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement as no other pattern of performance has been discernable nor has there been specific evidence of the fair value of the elements of these arrangements 
with the release of red hat advanced server in may  we believe that we will begin to have specific evidence of the fair value of the elements of these larger enterprise arrangements 
web based software sales are recognized over the subscription period beginning when shipped 
revenue from our oem arrangements are recognized over the subscription period beginning on the date we are notified sales have been made 
in addition  our enterprise subscription revenue is partially derived from sales of stronghold and red hat network 
stronghold is a secure enterprise ready web server based on apache and openssl 
stronghold is available to complement red hat linux advanced server as well as other operating systems 
red hat network is an internet based service to assure the security  availability and reliability of red hat linux  stronghold  database  e commerce and other red hat software solutions 
stronghold is the only software in which there is vendor specific evidence of fair value 
we recognize separate components of revenue related to the software delivered and the support subscription agreement 
we are able to estimate the value of stronghold as the initial copy of the software is purchased with a support subscription and any additional support subscriptions are purchased separately 
red hat network is sold in the form of a monthly subscription 
revenues are therefore recognized on a monthly basis 
embedded subscription consists of revenue for technical support and maintenance services provided pursuant to software compiling  debugging  and optimization agreements 
revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  which is typically twelve months 
services revenue services revenue is comprised of embedded development and open source services 
embedded development services are contracts for compiling  debugging  and optimization of various open source software technologies 
revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method  provided that we have the ability to make reliable estimates of progress towards completion  the fee for such services is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
open source services is comprised of revenue for open source consulting and engineering services  customer training and education 
open source consulting services are provided under agreements where customers are paying us on a fixed fee or hourly basis to assist in the deployment of open source technologies 
revenue from customer training and education is recognized at the date the services are performed 
further implementation guidelines relating to sop and related modifications may result in unanticipated changes in our revenue recognition practices and such changes could significantly affect our future revenue and results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of its property and equipment and other assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and by broadening the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
an impairment loss is recognized when the net book value of such assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets or the business to which the assets relate 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets 
results of operations years ended february  and february  total revenue total revenue decreased to million for the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  revenue from international operations totaled million and million during the years ended february  and february   respectively 
subscription revenue subscription revenue is comprised of revenue from enterprise and embedded customers 
enterprise sales primarily relates to sales of red hat linux and related software solutions  sales of software development tools  and technical support and maintenance fees 
enterprise subscription revenue decreased slightly to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  this small decline represents a reduction in web advertising revenues of million to million in fiscal offset by an increase in enterprise subscription revenues of million 
the increase in enterprise subscription revenues primarily relates to sales of red hat solutions to large enterprise customers 
there were no major markets added during fiscal compared to fiscal we introduce a new version of linux approximately every six months 
embedded subscription revenue decreased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  the decrease in embedded markets is primarily due to the continued weak performance of the semiconductor and telecommunications industries which has impacted research and development spending 
services revenue services revenue is comprised of open source services and embedded development services 
open source services includes fees received from enterprise customers for deployment  management and support of red hat open source solutions  and customer training and education fees 
open source services revenue increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the increase in open source services revenue is primarily due to revenues earned from relationships with the global as a result of the increasing level of interest and adoption by large enterprises of red hat linux as an enterprise computing platform 
as a result of our restructuring from a retail software products company to a provider of open source solutions to the large enterprise  we expect this component of revenue to be our largest growth area in the next months 
customer training and education services revenue also increased to million in year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the increase is the direct result of the expansion of our course offerings over the past two years and migration of larger enterprises to the linux platform  increasing the need to train system administrators and developers 
embedded services revenue decreased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  the decrease in embedded markets is primarily due to the continued weak performance of the semiconductor and telecommunications industries which has impacted research and development spending 
cost of revenue cost of subscription revenue cost of enterprise subscription revenue primarily consists of expenses we incur to manufacture  package  distribute and support our solutions 
these costs include expenses for physical media  literature and packaging  fulfillment and shipping  labor related costs to provide technical support and maintenance and bandwidth costs for red hat network 
cost of subscription revenue decreased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  this decrease was directly related to a reduction in expenses incurred for physical media  literature  packaging and fulfillment  as well as efficiencies gained in providing technical support and maintenance of our products on line  global consolidation of our support and maintenance function and benefits of red hat network in reducing support costs of red hat linux based systems 
cost of services revenue cost of services revenue is primarily comprised of salaries and related costs including non cash  stock based compensation charges incurred for our personnel to deliver custom development  open source consulting engineering  training and education  and hardware certification services 
we incur no direct costs related to royalties received from the licensing of our trademarks to third parties 
cost of services revenue decreased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  this decrease was primarily due to the reduction in number of personnel dedicated to providing custom development services to semiconductor companies and device manufacturers 
we expect cost of services to increase as we further expand our service offerings 
cost of services as a percentage of services revenue is expected to vary significantly from period to period depending upon the mix of services we provide  the number and scope of custom development contracts  whether such services are provided by us or third party partners and contractors  the overall utilization rate of our consulting staff  and the use of our red hat managed services and specifically red hat network to deliver these services gross profit gross profit increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  this increase was primarily the result of our focus on operational efficiency  continuing to migrate the services we provide with our technology to be technology based services not people based services  and in selling more strategic  higher margin product solutions to major enterprise customers 
operating expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs including non cash  stock based compensation charges for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel  public relations and marketing materials and tradeshows 
sales and marketing expense decreased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  this decrease was due primarily to reduction in redundant sales and marketing personnel and other variable costs 
these personnel came from acquisitions completed in late fiscal this decrease was partially offset by an increase in enterprise sales costs as we began to increase the size of our direct outside sales force which sells into the global in the fourth quarter of fiscal research and development research and development expense consists primarily of personnel and related costs including non cash  stock based compensation charges for development of our software products and web site 
research and development expense increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the increase in research and development expense resulted from increased spending related to the development of our first enterprise class operating platform  red hat advanced server million  costs incurred to complete the aggregation  development and testing of version and of red hat linux  and an increase in spending related to the development of software development tools for the enterprise 
general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of merger and acquisition costs and personnel and related costs including non cash  stock based compensation charges for general corporate functions  including finance  accounting  legal  human resources  facilities and information systems expenses 
mergers and acquisition expense primarily consists of severance and related expenses incurred in connection with redundancies identified pursuant to mergers and acquisitions completed by the company  as well as  the costs of certain individuals within the company who are dedicated to seeking out and identifying potential acquisition candidates 
in addition to this  mergers and acquisition expense includes legal costs incurred related to acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting 
general and administrative expense decreased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  this decrease resulted from a significant decrease in the number of companies acquired during fiscal resulting in  a decrease in merger and acquisition expenses to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february   a decrease in payroll and other administrative costs resulting from acquisitions completed in fiscal  and a decrease in stock based compensation expense 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles amortization of goodwill and intangibles expense consists of the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill  which represents the excess of acquisition cost over the net assets acquired in business combinations  is amortized over its estimated useful life  which is three years 
costs incurred for acquiring trademarks  copyrights and patents are capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from three to five years 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles expense increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  this increase was primarily due to the numerous acquisitions that were completed in fiscal and accounted for as purchase transactions 
restructuring charges restructuring charges consist of an impairment of million in the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles related to acquisitions made in prior periods  various facility closings  and million in severance and related expenses 
these restructuring charges were primarily due to a sharpening of the company s focus on unix to linux migration opportunities in significant enterprises 
as a result  the company terminated certain employees of pti and all employees of hell s kitchen systems and akopia during fiscal as these technologies were aimed at the small and medium business market 
in total  the company terminated employees 
there was no restructuring charge in fiscal in the fourth quarter  we completed the re allocation of our resources to focus on the global market which resulted in discontinuing our network consulting business 
other income expense  net other income expense  net consists of interest income earned on cash deposited in money market accounts and invested in short and long term fixed income instruments  net of interest expense incurred on short term debt and capital leases 
interest income  net  decreased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  these amounts are net of interest expense of million in the year ended february  and million in the year ended february  the decrease resulted from reductions in short term interest rates due to the actions taken by the federal reserve board and lower average cash and investment balances in the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february  due primarily to the use of cash to partially fund operations and to pay merger and acquisition and restructuring costs 
discontinued operations during january   the company adopted a formal plan to discontinue its network consulting operations 
accordingly  the network consulting operations were accounted for as a discontinued operation beginning with the fiscal year consolidated financial statements 
the company completed the disposal of the network consulting operations in february through termination of associated employees 
loss on disposal of discontinued operations of million in fiscal year included the write off of goodwill recorded in pti s acquisition of ens of million  severance and related costs of million  and a provision against accounts receivable of million 
years ended february  and february  total revenue total revenue increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  revenue from international operations totaled million and million during the years ended february  and february   respectively 
we established international operations for sale of our software products in august prior to august  our international revenue was limited to revenue generated from custom development services performed for international customers 
subscription revenue subscription revenue increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  this increase was primarily due to the release of two new versions of red hat linux during fiscal  rapid growth of our international operations  introduction of new open source solutions during fiscal and an increase in technical support and maintenance revenue as a result of our increased focus on providing these services in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year services revenue services revenue increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the increase in services revenue resulted primarily from an increase in custom development revenue due to an increase in the number  size and scope of custom development contracts  an increase in the number of network consulting engagements and expansion of the company s network consulting and engineering offerings  and an increase in training and education revenue due to the expansion of our course offerings in the year ended february  cost of revenue cost of subscription revenue cost of subscription revenue increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  this increase was directly related to the increase in costs to provide telephone support and subscription services upon the release of version of red hat linux and the increase in sales volumes as a result of the release of version of red hat linux in september and costs incurred to provide technical support and maintenance services 
this decrease was due to an increase in sales volumes  which resulted in a decrease in cost per unit  and use of the internet as a delivery mechanism for the technical support and maintenance of our products in the year ended february  cost of services revenue cost of services revenue increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  this increase was primarily due to the addition of personnel to provide custom development  network consulting and engineering  training and education  and hardware certification services  and the development of our services organization 
gross profit gross profit increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  this increase was primarily the result of the increases in sales of software products  due to the release of version of red hat linux in march  the release of version of red hat linux in september  and web advertisements which were at a higher proportion relative to the associated cost of revenue 
operating expense sales and marketing sales and marketing expense increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  this increase was due primarily to higher advertising and promotional costs incurred to promote the release of version and of official red hat linux  our web advertising and service offerings and  to a lesser extent  our new software development tools 
this increase was also due to higher costs resulting from joint marketing arrangements with distributors and to increased stock based compensation charges 
research and development research and development expense increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  the increase in research and development expense resulted from increased spending related to the development of our web initiatives and costs incurred to complete the development of version and of official red hat linux and an increase in stock based compensation expense  partially offset by a decrease in spending related to the development of software development tools as these products were completed during the year ended february  general and administrative general and administrative expense increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  this increase resulted from a decrease in merger and acquisition expenses to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february  an increase in payroll costs  due to an increase in the number of general and administrative personnel to support the growth of our business  an increase in stock based compensation expense  an increase in legal and accounting costs as a result of our becoming a public company and our geographic expansion  and an increase in insurance costs as a result of our becoming a public company 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles amortization of goodwill and intangibles expense increased to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  these increases were primarily due to the acquisition of hks  ens  bluecurve  wirespeed  cnet  and akopia during the year ended february  other income expense  net interest income  net  increased to million in the year ended february  from interest income  net  of million in the year ended february  these amounts are net of interest expense of million in the year ended february  and million in the year ended february  this increase resulted from higher average cash and investment balances in the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february  due primarily to the receipt of proceeds from the sale of common stock in our initial and secondary public offerings in august and february  respectively 
accretion of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock accretion of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock decreased to zero in the year ended february  from  for the year ended february  accretion of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock ceased with the completion of our initial public offering in august when all outstanding mandatorily redeemable preferred stock converted to common stock 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically derived a significant portion of our liquidity and operating capital from the sale of equity securities  including private sales of preferred stock and the sale of common stock in our initial and secondary public offerings  and from cash flows from operations 
at february   we had total cash and investments of million  which is comprised of million in cash and cash equivalents  million of short term  fixed income investments and million of long term  fixed income investments 
at february   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  a decrease of million as compared to february  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents resulted primarily from the purchase of investments in debt securities  net of sales of debt securities  of million  cash used by operations of million  including million for payments of restructuring costs  primarily severance payments  and million used for merger and acquisition costs and million used by discontinued operations  purchases of property and equipment of million  acquisition of a business of million  and million used to fund stock repurchases 
these uses of cash were offset by million of cash raised from borrowings  net of repayments  and million in cash received from the exercise of common stock options and sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
cash used in operations of million in the year ended february   represented the net loss of million  a decrease in deferred revenue of million  a decrease in accounts payable of million and a decrease in accrued expenses of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of million and net non cash charges of million 
cash used in operations includes million for payments of restructuring costs  million used for merger and acquisition activities and million used by discontinued operations 
in fiscal year ended february   cash used in operations was million 
the significant improvement in our cash flow used in operations in fiscal is a result of management s increased focus on improved operating results and preserving our cash balance 
we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations on a gaap basis in fiscal cash used in investing activities of million was comprised of the purchase of investments in debt securities  net of maturities  of million  purchases of property and equipment mainly computer hardware and computer networking equipment totaling million  and million used to acquire a business 
as market interest rates declined throughout fiscal year ended february   the company used cash and cash equivalents to purchase fixed income debt securities to improve the yield on our investments 
the million used to acquire a business relates to cash paid in fiscal year for a business acquired just prior to the beginning of fiscal year cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended february  was comprised of million in proceeds from issuing short term notes payable  net of in repayments of short term notes payable  million on proceeds from the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan  and million in proceeds from the sale of common stock 
this was partially offset by million used to purchase treasury stock  million of notes receivable accepted  and million in payments of capital lease obligations 
the significant majority of the borrowings and repayments related to the  line of credit we initiated in august at february   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  a decrease of million as compared to february  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents resulted primarily from the purchase of net investments in debt and equity securities of million  cash used by operations of million  including million of merger and acquisition costs  and million for the purchase of office and computer equipment 
cash used in operations of million in the year ended february   represented the net loss of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in inventory of million  an increase in intangibles and other assets of million and a decrease in accounts payable of million  partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses of million and net non cash charges of million 
the increase in accounts receivable resulted primarily from the release of version of red hat linux to our distributors in september and to increased services performed by our network consulting and engineers during the year ended february  as a result of contracts acquired in the acquisition of ens 
cash used in operations includes million representing costs incurred related to merger and acquisition activities 
cash used in investing activities of million was comprised of the purchase of investments in debt securities  net of maturities  of million and purchases of property and equipment totaling million  net of million acquired through acquisitions 
cash used in financing activities of million for the year ended february  was comprised of million for the purchase of treasury stock  million for the payment of dividends by pti related to an acquisition in april  and million of repayments of notes payable 
this was partially offset by of million in net proceeds from borrowings by pti  million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants  million in proceeds from the sale of common stock and million in proceeds from the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
we have experienced a substantial increase in our operating expenses since our inception in connection with the growth of our operations and staffing and the expansion of our services operation and acquisition activity 
our capital requirements during the year ending february  will depend on numerous factors including the amount of resources we devote to funding the development of our enterprise solutions  such as red hat advanced server  accelerating the development of our managed services offerings  expanding our product offerings  improving and extending our service offerings  pursuing strategic acquisitions and alliances  and making possible investments in businesses  products and technologies in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we used million in operating activities  as compared to million  million and million in the third  second and first quarters of fiscal  respectively 
excluding restructuring and merger and acquisition costs  our adjusted cash flow provided by used in operations were million   
million and 
million for the first  second third and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively 
given the rate at which we have used cash to fund our operations during fiscal and the million of cash and investments held at february   we do not anticipate the need to raise funds either through the sale of additional equity or through the issuance of debt for the foreseeable future 
however  on may   the company increased the size of its existing credit facility from million to million 
this was done to provide the company more flexibility in managing its working capital and to take advantage of current market interest rates  which are quite low by historical standards 
we believe that cash flow from operations will continue to improve during fiscal  however  there can be no assurances that we will improve our cash flow from operations from the current rate  or that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations 
we may choose to accelerate the expansion of our business  which may require us to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or through other financing means 
there can be no assurances that any such financing would occur in amounts or on terms favorable to us  if at all 
we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements and do not utilize any structured debt  special purpose or similar unconsolidated entities for liquidity or financing purposes 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these standards become effective for fiscal years beginning after december  beginning march   goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests 
all other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the new rules also require business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and goodwill acquired after june  will not be amortized 
goodwill existing at june   will continue to be amortized through the end of the company s fiscal through the end of fiscal  the company has tested goodwill for impairment using the current method  which uses an undiscounted cash flow test 
during fiscal  the company will begin to test goodwill for impairment under the new rules  applying a fair value based test 
based on acquisitions completed as of june   application of the goodwill non amortization provisions of these rules is expected to result in a reduction of amortization expense in fiscal of approximately million absent any impairment of the related goodwill 
factors affecting future results risks related to our linux based open source business model we depend on the support of linux developers not employed by the us to release major product upgrades and maintain market share 
we may not be able to release major product upgrades of official red hat linux on a timely basis because the heart of official red hat linux  the linux kernel  is maintained by third parties 
linus torvalds  the original developer of the linux kernel  and a small group of independent engineers are primarily responsible for the development and evolution of the linux kernel 
if this group of developers fails to further develop the linux kernel or if mr 
torvalds or other prominent linux developers  such as alan cox  david miller or stephen tweedie  were to join one of our competitors or no longer work on the linux kernel  we would have to either rely on another party to further develop the kernel or develop it ourselves 
we cannot predict whether enhancements to the kernel would be available from reliable alternative sources 
we could be forced to rely to a greater extent on our own development efforts  which would increase our development expenses and may delay our product release and upgrade schedules 
in addition  any failure on the part of the kernel developers to further develop and enhance the kernel could stifle the development of additional linux based applications 
the scarcity of software applications for linux based operating systems could prevent widespread commercial adoption of our products 
our products will not be able to gain widespread commercial adoption until there are more third party enterprise software applications that have been migrated to operate on linux based operating systems 
these applications include word processors  databases  software development tools  enterprise middleware  such as messaging and file system technologies  internet browsers  presentation and graphics software 
we intend to encourage the development of additional applications that operate on linux based operating systems by attracting third party developers to the linux platform  by providing open source tools to create these applications and by maintaining our existing developer relationships through marketing and technical support for third party developers 
if we are not successful in achieving these goals  however  our products will not gain widespread commercial acceptance and we will not be able to maintain our product sales growth 
our customers may find it difficult to install and implement red hat linux advanced server  which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage our reputation 
installation and implementation of red hat linux advanced server often involves a significant commitment of resources  financial and otherwise  by our customers 
this process can be lengthy due to the size and complexity of our products and the need to purchase and install new applications 
the failure by us to attract and retain services personnel to support our customers  the failure of companies with which we have strategic alliances to commit sufficient resources towards the installation and implementation of our products  or a delay in implementation for any other reason could result in dissatisfied customers 
this could damage our reputation and the red hat brand and result in decreased revenue 
we may be unable to predict the future course of open source technology development  which could reduce the market appeal of our products and damage our reputation 
we do not exercise control over many aspects of the development of open source technology 
historically  different groups of open source software programmers have competed with each other to develop new technology 
typically one of those groups develops the technology that becomes more widely used than that developed by others 
if we adopt new technology and incorporate it into our products  and competing technology becomes more widely used  the market appeal of our products may be reduced  which could harm our reputation  diminish the red hat brand and result in decreased revenue 
risks related to our financial results and condition we have incurred substantial losses on a gaap basis in the past 
we have incurred operating losses in six of our previous seven fiscal years  including our most recent fiscal year ended february  we do not expect to incur significant losses in the future  however  we cannot be certain when or if we will achieve sustained profitability 
failure to become and remain profitable may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital and continue operations 
you should not rely on our quarterly results of operations as an indication of our future results because they fluctuate significantly and are difficult to forecast 
due to the unpredictability of our business and the technology spending environment  our revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and are difficult to forecast 
we base our current and projected future expense levels in part on our estimates of future revenue 
our expenses are  to a large extent  fixed in the short term 
we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly if our revenue falls short of our expectations 
accordingly  a revenue shortfall in a particular quarter could have a disproportionate adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter 
you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance 
our future operating results may fall below expectations of securities analysts or investors  which would likely cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly 
we may not be able to effectively attract additional enterprise customers and preserve relationships with current enterprise customers  which could adversely affect revenue 
historically  we focused our sales and marketing efforts on product sales to individuals 
we have recently  however  begun to focus our efforts on expanding our enterprise customer base 
to this end  we have invested extensively to attract enterprise customers 
these enterprise customers expect diverse and extensive service programs  and if we are unable to continue to successfully expand and enhance our service offerings  we may not be able to meet these customers needs or attract new customers  and  consequently  our revenue would suffer 
our management team may not be able to successfully implement our business strategies because it has only recently begun to work together 
our business is highly dependent on the ability of our management to work together effectively to meet the demands of our growth 
several members of our senior management have been employed by us for a relatively short period of time 
these individuals have not previously worked together as a management team 
the failure of our management team to work together effectively could prevent efficient decision making by our executive team  affecting product development and sales and marketing efforts  which would negatively impact our operating results 
we depend on our key personnel 
our future success depends on the continued services of a number of key officers  including our chief executive officer and president  matthew j 
szulik  our chief operating officer  timothy j 
buckley  our chief technical officer  michael tiemann  and our chief financial officer  kevin b 
thompson 
the loss of the technical knowledge and industry expertise of any of these people could seriously impede our success 
moreover  the loss of one or a group of our key employees  particularly to a competitor  and any resulting loss of customers could reduce our market share and diminish the red hat brand 
with our declining stock price we may have increased difficulty in attracting and retaining highly skilled employees 
as with most technology companies  a key component of our compensation package for our employees is stock options 
with the decline in our stock price  many of the options granted in the last months are now out of the money 
in order to retain our highly skilled workforce  we may be compelled to grant new options 
if such new options are granted  they are likely to have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 
we may lack the financial and operational resources needed to increase our market share and compete effectively with microsoft  other established operating systems developers  software development tools developers and other service and support providers 
in the market for operating systems  we face significant competition from larger companies with greater financial resources and name recognition than we have 
these competitors  which offer hardware independent multi user operating systems for intel platforms and or unix based operating systems  include microsoft  novell  ibm  sun microsystems  the santa cruz operation  at t  compaq  hewlett packard  olivetti and unisys 
some of these competitors currently  or may in the future  produce and market open source operating systems 
we also face competition in the market for software development tools and operating systems for special purpose computing  including embedded systems 
our competitors in this market  some of which have greater market share than we do  include wind river systems  montavista software  green hills software  and the metrowerks subsidiary of motorola 
some of these companies currently produce or use open source software as part of their product offerings 
we may not be able to compete effectively in this market if customers choose proprietary solutions 
if the demand for open source solutions in this market expands  however  we could lose market share as existing competitors reposition or new companies emerge to address the opportunity 
as we increase our services offerings  we may face competition from larger and more capable companies that currently service and support the linux operating system as well as other operating systems  particularly unix based operating systems  due to the fact that linux and unix based operating systems share many common features 
these companies  including ibm and hewlett packard  may be able to leverage their existing service organizations and provide higher levels of consulting and support on a more cost effective basis than we can 
we may not be able to compete successfully with these current or potential competitors 
if we fail to establish and maintain strategic distribution and other collaborative relationships with industry leading companies  we may not be able to attract and retain a larger customer base 
our success depends on our ability to continue to establish and maintain strategic distribution and other collaborative relationships with industry leading hardware manufacturers  distributors  software vendors and enterprise solutions providers 
these relationships allow us to offer our products and services to a much larger customer base than we would otherwise be able to through our direct sales and marketing efforts 
we may not be able to maintain these relationships or replace them on attractive terms 
in addition  our existing strategic relationships do not  and any future strategic relationships may not  afford us any exclusive marketing or distribution rights 
as a result  the companies with which we have strategic alliances are free to pursue alternative technologies and to develop alternative products and services in addition to or in lieu of our products and services  either on their own or in collaboration with others  including our competitors 
moreover  we cannot guarantee that the companies with which we have strategic relationships will market our products effectively or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales  marketing and technical support 
we may not be able to meet the operational and financial challenges that we will encounter as our international operations expand 
as we expand our international operations  we will face a number of additional challenges associated with the conduct of business overseas 
for example we may have difficulty managing and administering a globally dispersed business  fluctuations in exchange rates may negatively affect our operating results  we may not be able to repatriate the earnings of our foreign operations  we have to comply with a wide variety of foreign laws  we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks overseas due to the uncertainty of laws and enforcement in certain countries relating to the protection of intellectual property rights  export controls and times of crisis could prevent us from shipping our products into and from some markets  multiple and possibly overlapping tax structures could significantly reduce the financial performance of our foreign operations  changes in import export duties and quotas could affect the competitive pricing of our products and services and reduce our market share in some countries  and economic or political instability in some international markets could result in the forfeiture of some foreign assets and the loss of sums spent developing and marketing those assets 
risks related to legal uncertainty we could be prevented from selling or developing our products if the gnu general public license and similar licenses under which our products are developed and licensed are not enforceable 
the linux kernel and the official red hat linux operating system have been developed and licensed under the gnu general public license and similar licenses 
these licenses state that any program licensed under them may be liberally copied  modified and distributed 
we know of no circumstance under which these licenses have been challenged or interpreted in court 
accordingly  it is possible that a court would hold these licenses to be unenforceable in the event that someone were to file a claim asserting proprietary rights in a program developed and distributed under them 
any ruling by a court that these licenses are not enforceable  or that linux based operating systems  or significant portions of them  may not be liberally copied  modified or distributed  would have the effect of preventing us from selling or developing our products 
our products may contain defects that may be costly to correct  delay market acceptance of our products and expose us to litigation 
despite testing by us and our customers  errors have been and may continue to be found in our products after commencement of commercial shipments 
this risk is exacerbated by the fact that most of the code in our products is developed by independent parties over whom we exercise no supervision or control 
if errors are discovered  we may have to make significant expenditures of capital to eliminate them and yet may not be able to successfully correct them in a timely manner or at all 
errors and failures in our products could result in a loss of  or delay in  market acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation and our ability to convince commercial users of the benefits of linux based operating systems and other open source software products 
in addition  failures in our products could cause system failures for our customers who may assert warranty and other claims for substantial damages against us 
although our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  it is possible that these provisions may not be effective or enforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions 
our insurance policies may not adequately limit our exposure to this type of claim 
these claims  even if unsuccessful  could be costly and time consuming to defend 
we are vulnerable to claims that our products infringe third party intellectual property rights particularly because our products are comprised of many distinct software components developed by thousands of independent parties 
we may be exposed to future litigation based on claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
this risk is exacerbated by the fact that most of the code in our products is developed by independent parties over whom we exercise no supervision or control 
claims of infringement could require us to reengineer our products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products 
in addition  an adverse legal decision affecting our intellectual property  or the use of significant resources to defend against this type of claim  could place a significant strain on our financial resources and harm our reputation 
our efforts to protect our trademarks may not be adequate to prevent third parties from misappropriating our intellectual property rights 
our most valuable intellectual property is our collection of trademarks 
the protective steps we have taken in the past have been  and may in the future continue to be  inadequate to deter misappropriation of our trademark rights 
although we do not believe that we have suffered any material harm from misappropriation to date  we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce  our trademark rights 
we have registered some of our trademarks in the united states  europe and australia and have other trademark applications pending in the united states  europe  australia  canada  europe and japan 
effective trademark protection may not be available in every country in which we offer or intend to offer our products and services 
failure to adequately protect our trademark rights could damage or even destroy the red hat brand and impair our ability to compete effectively 
furthermore  defending or enforcing our trademark rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
risks related to the market for our common stock our stock price has been extremely volatile and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above your purchase price 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  new products or services offered by red hat or our competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  conditions or trends in the internet  linux and software industries  changes in the economic performance and or market valuations of other internet  linux and software industries  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of common stock  and other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market and the market for internet related and technology companies in particular  has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
in addition  broad market and industry factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies 
such litigation  if instituted  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results
