business risks certain statements contained herein  including statements regarding development of the company s products  services  markets  and future demand for the company s products and services  and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts  are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 
these forward looking statements include risks and uncertainties 
consequently  actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
the following are some of the factors that may cause the company s future results of operations to differ materially from management s expectations and historic trends 

strategic alliances 
the company s relationships with its strategic allies  particularly sap and siebel  as well as documentum  lotus  microsoft  saba  wbt systems  centra software  sas institute  placeware  and element k have been  or are anticipated to be  important sources of revenue 
the company also faces potential competition from software companies  including its strategic allies who  through their client services groups  may choose to compete with the company 
many of these alliances are informal or terminable by either party with minimal notice 
the termination of  or any adverse change in any of these alliances  particularly sap or siebel  could adversely affect the company s ability to achieve its revenue and profitability goals 

general economic environment 
in  the company s sales of products and services relating to the it industry and the automotive sector experienced decreased demand as a result of the general slowdown in the business environment 
sales cycles were lengthened and clients deferred and cancelled certain projects 
although during  the company strengthened its business alliances  expanded its product offerings  and started diversification efforts into other industries  the actual demand for products and services remain difficult to forecast 

customer and industry revenue concentration 
the company continues to derive a substantial amount of its revenue from a limited number of key clients 
in  the company s top five clients and ten clients represented percent and percent of total revenue  respectively  with clients in the automotive industry generating percent of total revenue 
most of the company s engagements have no minimum purchase requirements and may be terminated by the client with little or no notice to the company 
many of these clients operate in cyclical industries  such as automotive and petroleum chemical  which are subject to economic factors that affect the clients revenue and profitability 
automotive industry sales are expected to decline in while the company anticipates less work in with its key automobile manufacturing clients  performance solutions has successfully obtained business in other industries and expects to continue diversification efforts  which may partially offset the decline in revenue from clients in the automotive manufacturing industry 
if any of the company s other major clients discontinue doing business with the company or significantly reduce the amount of products and services they purchase from the company  the company s revenue growth and profitability are likely to be adversely affected 

software product development 
rwd has invested in research and software product development and believes that timely development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products will expand its competitive position in the marketplace 
rwd anticipates continuing to invest in expanded functionality across its product offerings  including global product requirements and industry specific requirements 
there can be no assurance that such development efforts will result in products  features  or functionality  or that the products  features  or functionality that are developed will be accepted by the market 

geographic expansion 
the company continues to expand its operations and marketing efforts in europe  canada  and asia  including establishing offices and expatriating employees  thereby incurring significant operating costs 
if these efforts fail to produce revenue at expected levels or within the timeframe predicted by management  operating margins in would be adversely affected 
international operations present a number of risks  such as adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade barriers  cultural differences  and possible changes in taxes  laws  and policies governing the operations of foreign based companies 
the company has no control over these factors  any of which could adversely affect the company s results of operations and demand for its services abroad 

rapidly changing information technology sector 
the it industry is subject to significant and rapid changes in technology and the demand for particular products and services 
if the company fails to identify shifting demand for particular it services or does not develop the expertise necessary to provide services for which there is new demand  the company s revenue growth and profitability are likely to be adversely affected 
the company cannot be certain that it will experience continued growth in demand for these services 

increasing competition 
in recent years  the company has experienced heightened competition  particularly in the erp  esolutions  and elearning areas of its business 
if competition continues to intensify  the company may find it more difficult to resume revenue growth at rates comparable to its historic growth rates and to improve its profit margins over levels 

attracting and retaining personnel 
as is the case with most technology companies  the company experiences significant turnover in its technical staff 
the company s growth will continue to depend on its ability to attract  develop  and retain a sufficient number of skilled professional employees  and there is intense competition for qualified people 
also  the company will need to ensure that its technical personnel stay abreast of rapid changes in technology 
the company s operating costs may be higher than management expects if competition for qualified people increases and the company experiences higher turnover levels
