the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying certain critical accounting policies 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the company s condensed consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimates could differ markedly from current expectations 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of its accounting policies that affect the company s financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company reviews its long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the company has a significant amount of property and equipment and intangible assets 
the determination as to whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable involves management s judgment 
in addition  should the company conclude that recoverability of an asset is in question  the estimate of undiscounted future operating cash flows to determine whether an asset is recoverable and  if not  the final determination of the fair value of the asset are also based on the judgment of management 
these judgments can be impacted by a variety of underlying assumptions  such as the general business climate  effectiveness of competition and supply and cost of resources 
accordingly  actual results can differ significantly from the assumptions made by management in making its estimates 
future changes in management s estimates could result in indicators of impairment and future impairment charges 
new accounting standards to be adopted by the company effective september  eliminate the impairment recoverability tests for goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives and require that such assets be valued at the lower of their carrying value or fair value 
significant management judgment is involved in determining the fair value of assets 
accordingly  future changes in management s estimates could result in impairment charges of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
valuation of inventory 
the company values its inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
accordingly  the company records adjustments to the value of inventory based upon obsolescence and changes in market value as permanent changes in the carrying amount of such inventory until its ultimate sale or other disposition 
the company has evaluated the current level of inventories considering planned sales volume and other factors and  based on this evaluation  has recorded adjustments to cost of goods sold to adjust inventory to net realizable value 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions  customer demand or competition differ from expectations
