item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements set forth our critical accounting policies  including polices relating to revenue recognition  research and development expense  and use of estimates 
these policies are summarized below under critical accounting policies 
overview aaipharma inc is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition  development  enhancement and commercialization of branded pharmaceutical products 
historically  the majority of our net revenues have been in our research revenues business  with an increasing portion of our resources devoted to our product sales and product development businesses 
major customers for our pharmaceutical products are large well established medical wholesalers and distributors 
major customers for our research revenues and product development businesses are pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
product sales our product sales business unit  neosan pharmaceuticals  is focused on acquiring established  branded pharmaceutical products  developing improved products and product line extensions  and marketing and promoting these products 
we currently market products under the mvi  aquasol and brethine brand names  as a result of our product line acquisitions in product sales also include the commercial manufacturing of low volume products marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical companies 
the principal costs of this business include manufacturing costs under agreements with third party manufacturers  selling expense of our contract sales force  and research and development expense for product improvements and line extensions 
our results of operations can be influenced by the timing of purchases made by customers of neosan 
these customers are wholesalers and may increase their purchases if they anticipate a price increase 
wholesalers may anticipate a price increase due to the timing of prior increases  the acquisition of a product by a new supplier  our announcement of an increase or other reasons 
any increase in revenues during one period due to an anticipated price increase may likely be offset by decreased revenues in subsequent periods 
however  there may be some volatility of neosan s revenue in future periods due to the timing of its customers purchasing decisions 
product development our product development business unit  aairesearch  uses our research and development expertise and capabilities to study and develop new drug delivery technologies and improve existing pharmaceutical products 
we license the developed technologies and products to customers  usually before the development is complete 
we generally receive payments for our efforts and innovations upon the occurrence of defined events  known as milestones  which are intended to help cover the costs of development 
these milestone payments are not refundable 
in most cases  we also receive royalties on the eventual sales of the product 
because of the long term nature of these projects  we may recognize revenues from milestone payments or royalties in one period and the associated expenses in prior periods 
the principal expense of this business is research and development expense  which consists primarily of labor costs and costs for clinical trials 
in some cases  these costs may be directly reimbursed by our customers 
research revenues our research revenues business unit  aai international  provides research services through two primary groups  a non clinical group and a clinical group 
the non clinical group analyzes and tests various chemical compounds and provides small scale manufacturing of chemical compounds to be used for human clinical trials 
the services performed by the non clinical group also include chemical analysis  chemical synthesis  drug formulation  bio analytical testing  product life cycle management studies  and regulatory and compliance consulting 
all of these non clinical services involve either laboratory work or consulting services 
the clinical group performs testing for customers of new pharmaceutical products in humans under controlled conditions as part of the regulatory approval process for pharmaceutical products 
these clinical services involve conducting human clinical studies and the statistical analysis relating to these studies 
both the non clinical and clinical groups receive requests for services from customers  often on a competitive basis 
these projects vary in length from one month to several years 
in general  our customers may cancel a project upon days notice 
the principal expenses of this business are labor and depreciation of capital equipment 
acquisitions mvi and aquasol product lines on august   we acquired the mvi and aquasol branded lines of critical care injectable and oral nutritional products from astrazeneca for up to million payable over three years 
of this amount  we paid million at closing 
we funded this purchase price with increased borrowings under our existing senior credit facilities  which are described in liquidity and capital resources 
future guaranteed payments of million each are due in august and future contingent payments of million and million are potentially due in august and  respectively  but are contingent upon certain obligations being completed by astrazeneca  and have not yet been recorded as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
the mvi and aquasol product lines did not have separable assets and liabilities associated with them other than inventory  therefore we allocated the remaining purchase price to acquired identifiable intangible assets  with the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable intangible assets recorded as goodwill 
brethine product line on december   we acquired the brethine branded line of products from novartis for million 
we used borrowings of million under our existing senior credit facilities and cash on hand to pay this purchase price 
the brethine product line did not have separable assets and liabilities associated with it  therefore we allocated the purchase price to acquired identifiable intangible assets  with the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable intangible assets recorded as goodwill 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition net revenues 
our net revenues represent our total revenues less allowances for customer credits  including estimated discounts  product returns and non research and development expenses reimbursed by customers 
we accept returns of expired products 
product sales 
we recognize revenues for product sales at the time our products are shipped 
product development 
we recognize licensing revenues upon completion of interim contract milestones 
revenues from upfront licensing fees are deferred and amortized over the term of the associated agreement or as on going services are performed 
we recognize revenues for achieving contract milestones when achieved and royalty revenues as earned based on sales of the underlying products 
we bear the risk that some of the development projects may not be approved or that the eventual sales of a royalty generating product may not meet expectations 
research revenues 
we recognize revenues from fee for service contracts on a percentage of completion basis as the work is performed or on a time and materials basis in accordance with the specific contract terms 
revenues recognized prior to contract billing terms are recorded as work in progress 
provisions for losses on contracts  if any  are recognized when identified 
sab in december  the securities and exchange commission  or the sec  issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
this bulletin specifically addresses revenue recognition issues related to certain upfront payments or fees 
under this bulletin  certain upfront fees and payments recognized as income in prior periods are required to be deferred and are being amortized into revenues over the terms of the relevant agreements or as the on going services are performed 
we implemented staff accounting bulletin no 
in the fourth quarter of and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was retroactively adopted as of the beginning of the first quarter of during the year ended december   we recorded a charge of million million after tax  or a loss of per share for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle 
we recognized million in and million in of revenues related to the amortization of these deferred amounts 
research and development expense research and development expense consists of salaries of research and development personnel  raw material expenses  third party consulting and testing costs  and indirect costs such as management and administrative overhead and facilities costs 
research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred 
research and development arrangements research and development expense was of our net revenues in  and we expect research and development activities to account for between and of budgeted annual net revenues in the following product development table identifies  for each of our major development programs in  the stage of development at december  of the lead product in each program  research and development spending on each program in  cumulative research and development spending on each program from inception through december   an estimate of the additional research and development expense to complete the development of the lead product in the program  and the year in which we anticipate completing the lead product in the program 
the estimated additional expense to complete the lead product and the timing of completion represent our estimates 
as we continue these development programs and evaluate our interim results and other information  we may decide to change the scope and direction of a program and we may change how we allocate our research and development spending to pursue more promising product candidates 
in addition  our actual costs in developing these products may be materially different from our estimates due to uncertainties inherent in product development 
moreover  because of these inherent uncertainties  we may not be able to successfully develop  commercialize or license the products or technologies included in the table within the time periods specified  if at all 
estimated additional r d cumulative program r d spending to estimated year of major development program stage of development for program spending through complete completion and lead product lead product in program r d spending december  lead product of lead product dollars in millions products immunosuppression azasan awaiting fda approval pain management prosorb d phase iii gastrointestinal omeprazole entering pivotal trial critical care mvi pediatric liquid stability other n a n a n a n a technologies drug delivery fexofenadine pseudoephedrine phase iii includes an allocation of million of indirect costs  primarily management and administrative overhead and facilities costs  based on direct research and development costs in includes research and development expense incurred in connection with development of our patented prosorb technology  which is being applied to the lead product in this development program 
the lead product in this program  a liquid form of mvi pediatric  is undergoing stability testing 
under fda regulations  we believe that approval of this product will not require any clinical studies 
this product is being developed for a customer pursuant to a development agreement 
excludes research and development expense incurred in connection with the development of our patented prosorb technology 
we are developing additional identified products using our technologies for licensing to customers and anticipate an additional million to million of research and development expense to complete the development of these products 
in addition to the specifically identified programs named in the table  we have targeted additional product development programs or projects 
these other programs or projects may require significant research and development spending in future periods 
there is a risk that any specific research and development program or project may not produce revenues 
we believe that the potential profit margins from successful development programs or projects will compensate for costs incurred for unsuccessful projects 
we are currently involved in many pharmaceutical and technology development programs or projects and believe that these activities help to diversify our portfolio and manage our risk 
see risk factors we may incur substantial expense to develop products that we never successfully commercialize contained elsewhere in this report 
significant development agreement we have a development agreement with a customer that provides for us to receive contingent periodic payments based on sales of the customer s product and obligates the customer to use us on a fee for service basis for a product life cycle management project related to the product 
the development agreement relates to a product with respect to which we have licensed intellectual property that we developed in the past 
we have recognized product development royalty revenues under this agreement for the periodic payments based on product sales  and have recognized research revenues related to the product life cycle management project 
product development revenues from this agreement were million in  million in and million in we recognized no research and development expense in and associated with the royalty payments we received in and the expense of our work associated with these royalty revenues was recognized primarily in  and we do not anticipate incurring significant expense associated with the product development revenues under this agreement in future periods 
research revenues associated with this agreement were million in  million in and million in because of the research and development nature of our activities in this product life cycle management project and the potential that these activities could result in continuation of product development revenues into the future  we have recorded our costs incurred in this project as research and development expense million in  million in and million in accordingly  for our research revenues business unit  we have recognized no expense associated with the research revenues arising under this agreement  as this expense was recognized by our product development business unit 
we amended this agreement in december as amended  the agreement provides that  if we remain available to provide the customer with development and formulation services for an identified class of pharmaceutical products on an exclusive basis in a calendar quarter  we will be entitled to fees based on the level of sales over a prior monthly period of the product that was the subject of our development work 
the customer is obligated to make these quarterly payments based on whether defined market events have occurred in the prior measurement month eg  if the defined market events have not occurred during three consecutive months  we would be entitled to fees in three consecutive quarters  with  for example  the amount of the fees in the first quarter being based on product sales in the first month 
however  if we do not continue to provide these development and formulation services on an exclusive basis in any quarter  we will not be entitled to these fees for that quarter and all subsequent quarters 
under the agreement  we have the right  at any time  to terminate our obligation to provide the development and formulation services on an exclusive basis 
accordingly  we will not recognize product development revenues under this agreement in any quarter until we have satisfied the exclusivity requirement for that quarter 
we believe that we will be entitled to product development fees in each quarter of if we continue to provide the development services to the customer on an exclusive basis during those periods 
the amount of the fees due in the first quarter of is approximately million 
although we do not yet have sufficient data to calculate with precision the amounts that would be due in the remaining quarters of  we believe that the aggregate amount for  including the first quarter  will be in the range of million to million  although the actual amount could be higher or lower 
although we may also be entitled to receive similar fees in subsequent periods  neither we nor our customer control whether the market events will occur 
we believe there is significant risk that the market events will occur  and that as a result we will not be entitled to receive product development fees in or subsequent future periods 
the development agreement requires the customer to use a minimum amount of our research services at standard rates on the product life cycle management project in specified calendar quarters 
in  the amount of research work we performed for the customer on this project was significantly greater than the minimum amount  and during the project wound down to the minimum contractual levels 
the customer is obligated to continue the project at minimum levels through  and may be obligated to continue the project at further reduced levels for subsequent periods if the market events associated with terminating our right to receive product development fees described above do not occur 
results of operations the following table presents the net revenues for each of our business units and our consolidated expenses and net income loss and each item expressed as a percentage of consolidated net revenues years ended december  dollars in thousands net revenues product sales    product development    research revenues non clinical    clinical    direct costs    selling    general and administrative    research and development    direct pharmaceutical start up costs  interest income expense  net    provision for benefit from income taxes   net income loss   year ended december  compared to year ended december  our net revenues for the year ended december  increased to million  from million in this increase is primarily due to the acquisition by our neosan business unit of the mvi  aquasol and brethine branded products and an increase of million of net revenues associated with our significant development agreement described above 
net revenues from product sales increased in to million  from million in  due to sales of our mvi  aquasol and brethine products after we acquired them 
because these acquired product lines will contribute revenues for the full year ending december   we have planned for significantly increased net revenues and expenses from these product lines for net revenues from product sales in and prior periods consist of revenues from commercial manufacturing of products marketed by other pharmaceutical companies 
net revenues from commercial manufacturing contributed million to net revenues from product sales in net revenues from product development increased in to million  from million in  primarily due to a increase  or an increase of million  of product development net revenues under our significant development agreement described above in significant development agreement 
our expenses associated with the development work performed under this agreement were recognized primarily in  and no significant expense was associated with the product development revenues recognized in or  and we do not anticipate incurring significant expense associated with product development revenues from this agreement in future periods 
net revenues from our research revenues business increased in to million  from million in non clinical research revenues increased by in to million  an increase of million over the prior year 
clinical research revenues increased by in to million  from million in this increase was primarily attributable to revenues generated from significant new phase iii clinical trial contracts that we entered into in the second half of  including amendments to those contracts  in net revenues from our research revenues business associated with our significant development agreement described above decreased in to million  from million in gross margin dollars  or net revenues less direct costs  increased million  or  to million  from million in  reflecting our increased net revenues in over the prior year 
as a percentage of net revenues  gross margin dollars decreased slightly to in from in gross margin dollars from our product sales business increased million in  from million in  with a gross margin percentage of in additionally  gross margin dollars from our product development business increased to million in from million in  benefitting significantly from the million of product development revenues from our significant development agreement described above 
these higher margins generated by our product sales and product development businesses were offset by the lower gross margin percentage of our research revenues business in  reflecting a significant increase in lower margin clinical revenues and decrease in higher margin non clinical revenues  including fee for service revenues under our significant development agreement described above 
selling expenses increased in to million  from million in this increase is primarily due to additional selling expenses incurred by our product sales business associated with marketing and promoting our new products  maintaining and enhancing distribution channels  and developing our product sales force 
general and administrative costs increased in to million  from million in this increase was primarily due to increases in employee benefits  including healthcare  vacation costs and employee performance awards  and increases in legal fees related to protecting our intellectual property rights 
research and development expenses were approximately of net revenues  or million  in  a decrease from of net revenues  or million  in this decrease is primarily attributable to the winding down in of a significant product life cycle management project associated with the significant development agreement described above 
in general  we target annual research and development expenses to be approximately to of our estimated net revenues 
the direct pharmaceutical start up costs of million in represent costs of developing neosan s organizational and marketing infrastructure 
these costs were incurred prior to our acquisition of any product lines and were expensed as incurred in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
upon the acquisition of our first product line in august  we began classifying similar costs as selling or general and administrative costs  as appropriate 
net interest expense increased in to million  from million in this million increase is primarily attributable to the borrowings in that funded our product line acquisitions in august and december 
we have planned for significantly higher net interest expense in associated with the debt incurred to fund the acquisitions of the mvi  aquasol and brethine product lines 
completion of the pending acquisition of the darvon and darvocet product lines will also significantly increase interest expense in see liquidity and capital resources 
income from operations was million in  an million increase over the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to the expansion of our product sales business and an increase in product development revenues with low associated expenses from our significant development agreement described above 
this increase was offset by a decrease in income from operations in our research revenues business caused by the changing mix of revenues in that business 
we recorded income from operations for our product sales business of million in  compared to million in the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to our acquisitions of the mvi  aquasol and brethine product lines during we recorded income from operations for our product development business of million in  compared to a loss from operations of million in this resulted from increases in net revenues related to our significant development agreement described above 
unallocated corporate expenses increased by in to million  from million in this higher level was attributable to additions to our corporate infrastructure to accommodate the expansion of our overall business 
we recorded income from operations for our research revenues business of million in  compared to million in this decrease is primarily due to the changing mix of research revenues  with a significant increase in lower margin clinical revenues and a decline in higher margin product life cycle management revenues 
we recorded a tax provision of million in  based on an effective tax rate of 
this rate is slightly higher than the statutory rate due principally to permanent differences of million 
we recorded a net deferred tax asset of million at december   which we expect to utilize 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  our net revenues for the year ended december  grew to million  compared to million in  primarily due to an increase in revenues from our research revenues business  offset by lower product sales revenues 
net revenues from our research revenues business increased to million  from the million recorded in non clinical research revenues increased to million in  from million in non clinical research revenues increased primarily due to the increased revenues associated with our significant development agreement described above 
clinical research revenues declined in to million  down from million in net revenues from product sales decreased in to million  from million in these net revenues are solely from our manufacturing of low volume products for other pharmaceutical companies 
this decrease is primarily due to higher manufacturing volume in the fourth quarter of in connection with the commercial launch of an azathioprine product manufactured by us and marketed by another pharmaceutical company 
net revenues from product development decreased in to million  compared to million in gross margin dollars increased to million in  from million in gross margin dollars as a percentage of net revenues increased from in to in the higher gross margin percentage in reflects an increase in higher margin non clinical revenues from our significant development agreement described above and the full year effect of cost containment programs that we initiated in late selling expenses decreased in to million  from million the prior year 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling expense decreased to approximately in compared to in this decrease was primarily related to the realignment of our workforce in europe related to our merger with medical technical research associates  inc general and administrative costs increased in to million  from million in this increase is primarily due to expanding our management team and costs associated with organizing neosan 
research and development expenses were million in  or approximately of net revenues  compared with approximately in this increase is consistent with our strategy of long term product development and our continuing commitment to our development pipeline 
income from operations was million in  compared to a loss of million in this improvement was due in part to the impact on gross margin dollars of a more favorable revenue mix and the million pre tax charge in for costs associated with our merger with medical technical research associates  inc and subsequent restructuring 
income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was million  or per diluted share  compared to a loss of million  or per diluted share in our effective tax benefit rate in was different from the statutory rate primarily due to million in permanent differences offset by a million benefit resulting from the benefit of foreign net operating losses 
we had recorded a net deferred tax asset of million at december  liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our businesses with cash flows provided by operations and proceeds from borrowings 
cash flow provided by operations in was million  up from million in this increase is primarily due to our improved management of working capital  which was strongly influenced by the timing of transactions  including our receipt of million of product development payments associated with our significant development agreement described above and the collection of a significant receivable associated with this agreement 
our working capital improvement was partially offset by additional working capital needed to acquire the mvi  aquasol and brethine product lines 
cash used in investing activities was million in  which is primarily related to our acquisition of branded product lines 
our initial payment to astrazeneca to acquire the mvi and aquasol product lines was million 
future guaranteed payments of million each are due in august and future contingent payments of million and million are potentially due in august and  respectively 
in addition  we paid million to acquire the brethine product line and made an initial payment of million to acquire a sterile manufacturing facility located in charleston  south carolina 
additional contingent payments of up to million plus additional royalties may be due in increments through june  based on the level of manufacturing revenues at the charleston facility during this period 
these contingent payment obligations  including the contingent payments potentially due in connection with the acquisition of the mvi and aquasol product lines  have not yet been recorded as a liability on our balance sheet 
capital expenditures were million during capital assets purchased during were primarily related to our upgrading and replacing pharmaceutical development and information technology equipment 
cash provided by financing activities during was million  primarily representing net proceeds of million in borrowings to fund our product line acquisitions and million of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options  offset by repayments under our revolving credit facility of million 
in  million of cash was provided by operations  benefiting from net cash generated under our significant development agreement and improved working capital management 
during  net cash used in investing activities was million  primarily consisting of capital expenditures of million 
cash used in financing activities during was million  of which million represented repayments of borrowings 
in  million of cash was used in operations  million of which represented restructuring payments 
during  purchases of property and equipment were million 
major capital assets purchased during included equipment for a new corporate facility in wilmington  north carolina and continued implementation of a financial and operations enterprise management information system 
these uses of cash were funded through cash provided by net financing activities of million 
in august  we amended our loan agreement with bank lenders 
following such amendment  the loan agreement provided for borrowings of up to million  consisting of a term loan of million and a revolving credit facility of up to million 
in december  we amended the loan agreement to provide for an additional million term loan 
in december  we re paid million of the initial term loan 
the revolving credit facility under the loan agreement is based upon a borrowing base 
at december   the entire million of the revolving credit facility was available for borrowing based on our eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
the loan agreement provides for variable interest rates based on libor or base rate  at our option  and is secured by a security interest on substantially all of our domestic assets  all of the stock of our domestic subsidiaries and of the stock of our material foreign subsidiaries directly owned by us or one of our domestic subsidiaries 
at december   day libor was 
the loan agreement expires in january we have the option to extend the term of the loan agreement to december   if we satisfy specific financial and operating conditions 
if the extension option has not been exercised by january  any outstanding balances under this facility must be repaid 
scheduled maturities of long term debt in are million 
if we extend the loan agreement  quarterly principal payments on the term loans will begin in march if the loan agreement is not refinanced by september   or the option to extend the term to december  is not exercised by such date  we are obligated to pay an aggregate fee equal to of the outstanding term loans and revolving credit commitments under the loan agreement on such date 
an additional aggregate fee on the outstanding term loans and revolving credit commitments will be due on december  if our loan agreement is not refinanced or the option to extend the maturity is not exercised by such date 
the loan agreement requires the payment of certain commitment fees based on the unused portion of the revolving line of credit 
under the terms of the credit agreement  we are required to comply with various covenants including  but not limited to  those pertaining to maintenance of certain financial ratios and incurring additional indebtedness 
we were in compliance with the financial covenants under this credit agreement at december in march  we completed a sale leaseback transaction on manufacturing equipment  which provided cash of million 
the lease has a five year term and provides for payment of approximately million annually 
we currently lease two significant facilities  including our corporate headquarters in wilmington  north carolina  under the terms of a tax retention operating lease 
the lease for these facilities expires on september  at the end of the term  we may elect to purchase the facilities at fair market value or sell the properties 
on february   we entered into an agreement with eli lilly to acquire the us rights to the darvon and darvocet branded product lines for the treatment of mild to moderate pain and related inventory for million in cash  subject to reduction based on sales of these products before and after the closing of the acquisition 
we anticipate completing this acquisition by the end of the first half of we are currently seeking senior secured and senior subordinated debt financing of an aggregate of million to fund the acquisition of these product lines  to repay indebtedness outstanding under our existing loan agreement  to terminate our tax retention operating lease and purchase the underlying properties  and pay related fees and expenses 
our obligation to complete the acquisition of these product lines is contingent on obtaining this permanent debt financing 
our proposed senior secured credit facilities consist of a million five year revolving credit facility and a million five year term loan facility 
as proposed  the term loan facility amortizes over the full five year term  with amortization of million  million  million  million and million  respectively  in years one through five of the facility 
the revolving credit facility is not tied to a borrowing base 
our proposed senior credit facilities will provide for variable interest rates based on libor or base rate  at our option 
such facilities will be guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries and secured by a security interest on substantially all of our domestic assets  all of the stock of our domestic subsidiaries and of the stock of our material foreign subsidiaries directly owned by us or one of our domestic subsidiaries 
the proposed senior credit facilities will require the payment of certain commitment fees based on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
under the terms of the credit agreement for the proposed senior credit facilities  we will be required to comply with various covenants including  but not limited to  those pertaining to maintenance of certain financial ratios and incurrence of additional indebtedness 
the proposed senior credit facilities may be optionally prepaid at any time without a premium 
our proposed issuance of senior subordinated debt consists of million of senior subordinated notes due the notes will have a fixed interest rate to be established prior to the closing of the acquisition of darvon and darvocet 
the notes will be guaranteed on a subordinated basis by all of our existing domestic subsidiaries and all of our future domestic subsidiaries of which we and or our subsidiaries own or more of the equity interests 
the notes will not be secured 
prior to the third issuance of the notes  up to of the notes are redeemable with the proceeds of qualified sales of equity at a premium redemption price 
on or after the fourth anniversary of the date of issuance of the notes  all or any portion of the notes will be redeemable at a premium redemption price 
under the terms of the indenture for the notes  we will be required to comply with various covenants including  but not limited to  a covenant relating to incurrence of additional indebtedness 
our liquidity needs increased significantly during and will increase further upon the completion of our pending acquisition of the darvon and darvocet product lines 
after giving effect to our completed and pending branded product line acquisitions  our annual net interest expense may exceed million in we may have to make contingent payments in the next several years of million in connection with our product line acquisitions and million in connection with the purchase of our charleston manufacturing facility 
additionally  we will have million of principal repayments due in under our proposed new senior credit facilities 
we believe that our credit facilities and cash flow provided by operations will be sufficient to fund near term growth and fund our guaranteed and contingent payment obligations arising from our acquisitions of the mvi and aquasol product lines and the charleston  south carolina manufacturing facility 
we may require additional financing to pursue other acquisition opportunities or for other reasons 
we may from time to time seek to obtain additional funds through the public or private issuance of equity or debt securities 
while we remain confident that we can obtain additional financing if necessary  we cannot assure you that additional financing  including the proposed debt financing described above  will be available or that the terms will be acceptable to us 
first quarter non recurring charges upon successful completion of these proposed senior credit facilities and senior subordinated notes  we will record approximately million of expense  net of tax  from our writing off deferred financing costs associated with our current debt facilities 
this one time write off will significantly reduce our net income for the quarter in which we complete these debt financing transactions 
prior to the completion of the offering of the proposed senior subordinated notes  we plan to repurchase outstanding redeemable warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
based on the closing price per share of our common stock on the nasdaq stock market on march  of  the cost to purchase all of these warrants would be approximately million and we would recognize a charge of million 
related party transactions in  as part of our internal development program  we organized endeavor pharmaceuticals  inc to continue development of products that we had been developing on our own and to permit investors to directly invest in the development of these products 
we assigned our rights to these products to endeavor in return for approximately of endeavor s fully diluted equity 
as a result of additional issuances of equity by endeavor to third party investors  our fully diluted ownership interest in endeavor has been reduced to approximately 
as of december   dr 
frederick d 
sancilio  our chairman and chief executive officer  owned of endeavor s fully diluted equity and an affiliate of james l 
waters  one of our directors  owned 
we had net revenues for development services provided to endeavor at our standard rates of approximately million in  million in  and million in we had approximately  and  in related accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
we organized aesgen  inc with an affiliate of the mayo clinic in and funded it in with an affiliate of the mayo clinic  mova pharmaceutical corporation and certain other investors to combine our development capabilities with the medical expertise of the mayo clinic and to permit investors to directly invest in the development of these products 
we distributed our initial common stock investment in aesgen to our shareholders prior to our initial public offering in as a result  some of our directors  executive officers and holders of or more of common stock who held our stock prior to the initial public offering beneficially own common equity of aesgen 
in the aggregate they own less than of aesgen s fully diluted common equity 
at january   we held convertible preferred shares of aesgen that represent approximately of aesgen s fully diluted common equity 
in october  we agreed to provide research services to aesgen  through aai international  at our standard rates in exchange for million of aesgen convertible preferred stock  which at december  would represent an additional of aesgen s fully diluted common equity 
through december   we had performed  of services under the agreement 
in december  we acquired rights  title and interest to some of the products being developed by aesgen 
these products include five products for which abbreviated new drug applications have been approved by the fda  and two other products under development 
as consideration for the purchase of these products  we waived all claims to amounts due from aesgen 
at december   the approximate book value of these assets was  in february  we purchased a generic injectable vitamin d nutritional product from aesgen for payments of million in cash and additional contingent milestone payments of up to million 
if we receive approval from the fda  we intend to market this product as an extension of our aquasol product line 
under this agreement  we are obligated to pay royalty payments for the eight year period following the first commercial sale of this product 
we recognized net revenues of approximately   and  from aesgen for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we had no related accounts receivable or work in progress at december   and had approximately  of related accounts receivable and  of related work in progress at december  we have engaged cetan technologies  inc to provide us with computer scanning and indexing services  as well as fda mandated computer validation services 
the principal stockholders of cetan include three of our directors  including dr 
frederick sancilio  our chairman and chief executive officer 
we paid cetan approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  for scanning and validation services 
in addition  two of our directors serve as directors of cetan technologies  inc see certain relationships and related transactions and note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a more detailed description of these related party transactions 
inflation we believe that the effects of inflation generally do not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
euro conversion on january   the european union began denominating significant financial transactions in a new monetary unit  the euro 
the euro is intended to replace the traditional currencies of the individual european union member countries 
our operations in europe converted to the euro as a functional currency on august  our significant operations all have multi currency capable systems and have accounted for euro denominated transactions without additional modification or difficulty
