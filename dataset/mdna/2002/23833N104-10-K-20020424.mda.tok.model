item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgements  including those that relate to depreciable lives  goodwill and debt covenants 
the estimates and judgements made by management are based on historical data and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
depreciable lives expenditures for new facilities and those which substantially increase the useful lives of the property  including interest during construction  are capitalized along with equipment purchases at cost 
these costs are depreciated over various methods based on an estimate of the depreciable life  resulting in a charge to the operating results of the company 
the actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the depreciable lives are as follows property and equipment games years buildings years furniture  fixtures and equipment to years leasehold and building improvements shorter of years or lease life intangible assets trademarks over statutory lives lease rights over remaining lease term goodwill is being amortized over years 
whenever there is an indication of impairment  the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using future undiscounted cash flows 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations  however an impairment charge was not considered necessary under fas as of february  in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statements  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the company will apply the new standards on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of application of the nonamortization provisions of the statements is expected to result in an increase in income before tax of 
per diluted share in as a result of nonamortization of existing goodwill 
during the first quarter  the company will perform the required impairment test of goodwill as of february  based on current analysis  the company will record an expense to cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  net of income tax benefit of  
per diluted share  upon the adoption of the new standard 
debt covenants of the company s facility agreement require compliance with certain financial covenants including a minimum consolidated tangible net worth level  maximum leverage ratio  minimum fixed charge coverage and maximum level of capital expenditures 
the company was in compliance with the covenants for the fiscal year ended february  the company believes the results of operations for the fiscal year ending february  and thereafter would enable us to remain in compliance with the existing covenants absent any material negative event affecting the us economy as a whole 
however  the company s expectations of future operating results and continued compliance with the debt covenants cannot be assured and our lenders actions are not controllable by us 
if the projections of future operating results are not achieved and the debt is placed in default  the company would experience a material adverse impact on our reported financial position and results of operations
