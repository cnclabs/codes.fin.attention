item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources 
the following table sets forth selected quarterly financial data restated to reflect the merger of mb financial and midcity financial with and into the company  which is being accounted for as a pooling of interests in thousands  except common share data three months ended three months ended december september june march december september june march statement of income data interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses net interest income after provision for loan losses other income other expense income loss before income taxes income taxes net income loss common share data basic earnings loss per common share diluted earnings loss per common share weighted average common shares outstanding diluted weighted average common shares outstanding other expense includes expenses totaling million million net of the related tax benefit incurred due to the mb midcity merger 
for all quarters presented  common share data includes midcity financial common stock converted to company common stock at an exchange ratio of to and mb financial common stock converted to company common stock at an exchange ratio of to for the three months ended december   basic earnings per common share and diluted earnings per common share were and  respectively  excluding the impact of merger expenses totaling million net of the related tax benefit incurred due to the mb midcity merger 
fourth quarter results the company incurred a net loss of million in the fourth quarter of compared to net income of million in excluding merger expenses  net income would have been million in the fourth quarter of  an increase of compared to million for the fourth quarter of net interest income was million for the three months ended december  compared to million for the three months ended december   an increase of 
net interest income increased due to growth in the company s average interest earning assets  as well as interest bearing liabilities repricing at a faster pace than interest earning assets in the current interest rate environment 
in the fourth quarter of  million was added to the allowance for loan losses due to increased net charge offs during the quarter resulting from the charge off of million in loans to two commercial customers 
other income increased million to million for the quarter ended december  from million for the same period in the majority of the increase came from growth in loan service fees  deposit service fees  trust and brokerage fees and net lease financing of thousand  thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively 
other expense increased million to million from million from the fourth quarter of the increase was primarily due to expenses of million related to the mb midcity merger consummated in the fourth quarter 
other increases were due to a million increase in salaries and other employee benefits due to continued investments in people  the acquisition of first savings and loan of south holland in the second quarter of  as well as a thousand increase in other operating expenses 
the above increases were partially offset by a thousand decline in advertising and marketing expense 
income tax expense for the quarter ended december  was million compared to million for the quarter ended december  the fourth quarter expense includes an income tax benefit not being recorded for million in merger expenses which related to professional and investment banking fees and a valuation reserve being established in conjunction with the mb midcity merger for the company s state net operating loss carryforwards which may no longer be utilized 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of the company s financial position and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under general in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing under item of this report 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the merger of mb financial and midcity financial with and into the company  which was completed on november  has been accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting and the historical financial statements of the company reflect the merged companies combined 
general net income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in basic earnings per share declined by to for the year ended december  from in fully diluted earnings per share declined by to in compared to in excluding expenses related the mb midcity merger  net income for the year ended december  increased by million to million from the profitability of the company s operations depends primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between total interest earned on interest earning assets and total interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the company s net income is affected by its provision for loan losses as well as other income and other expenses 
the provision for loan losses reflects the amount thought to be adequate to cover probable credit losses in the loan portfolio 
non interest income or other income consists of loan service fees  deposit service fees  net lease financing income  trust and brokerage fees  net gains losses on the sale of securities available for sale  increase in cash surrender value of life insurance and other operating income 
other expenses include salaries and employee benefits along with occupancy and equipment expense  advertising and marketing expense  intangibles amortization expense and other operating expenses including merger expenses 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets  the level of interest rates earned on those assets  the volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities  and the level of interest rates paid on those interest bearing liabilities 
the provision for loan losses is dependent on changes in the loan portfolio and management s assessment of the collectibility of the loan portfolio  as well as economic and market conditions 
other income and other expenses are impacted by growth of operations and growth in the number of accounts through both acquisitions and core banking business growth 
growth in operations affects other expenses as a result of additional employees  branch facilities and promotional marketing expense 
growth in the number of accounts affects other income including service fees as well as other expenses such as computer services  supplies  postage  telecommunications and other miscellaneous expenses 
net interest income the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  and the resultant costs  expressed both in dollars and rates dollars in thousands year ended december  average balance interest yield rate average balance interest yield rate average balance interest yield rate interest earning assets loans loans exempt from taxes taxable investment securities investment securities exempt from federal income taxes federal funds sold other interest bearing deposits total interest earning assets non interest earning assets total assets interest bearing liabilities deposits now and money market deposit savings deposit time deposits short term borrowings long term borrowings total interest bearing liabilities demand deposits non interest bearing other non interest bearing liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity net interest income interest rate spread net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis net interest margin non accrual loans are included in average loans 
interest income includes loan origination fees of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
non taxable investment income is presented on a fully tax equivalent basis assuming a tax rate 
interest rate spread represents the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities and is presented on a fully tax equivalent basis 
net interest margin represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
for the year ended december   net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased million to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in net interest income resulted from a decrease in interest expense of million  or  which exceeded the thousand decline in interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
interest income decreased due to a basis point decline in fully taxable equivalent yield on average earning assets in the current declining rate environment to 
the decrease in yield was partially offset by a million  or increase in average earning assets  comprised of a million  or increase in average loans offset by a million  or decline in average taxable investment securities 
interest expense declined due to a basis point decline in the cost of funds to  which was partially offset by a million  or increase in average interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin expressed on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined by two basis points to for the year ended december  from in the comparable period 
for the year ended december   net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased million to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in net interest income resulted from an increase in interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of million  or  partially offset by an increase in interest expense of million  or

volume  mix and rate analysis of net interest income the following table presents the extent to which changes in volume  changes in mix and changes in interest rates of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected the company s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided on changes in each category due to i changes attributable to changes in volume current period volume  less current mix percentage multiplied by prior period total volume  multiplied by prior period rate  ii changes attributable to changes in mix current mix percentage multiplied by total prior period volume  less prior period volume multiplied by prior period rate and iii changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by current period volume in thousands

other income other income increased million to million in the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  loan service fees increased by million due to greater volumes and higher income realized on interest only securities 
net gains on available for sale securities increased by million in as none were realized during deposit service fees grew million to million due to increased volumes of monthly service charges and overdraft and nsf fees 
trust and brokerage fees grew by thousand due to increased commissions on investment products 
increase in cash surrender value of life insurance increased by thousand while other operating income declined by million primarily due to lower gains on sale of other real estate owned 
for the year ended december   other income increased thousand to million from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to a million increase in cash surrender value of life insurance and a million increase in net lease financing income  of which approximately thousand was the result of gains on residual dispositions at the end of lease terms and thousand due to a write down in the residual value of lease equipment in the fourth quarter of other operating income grew by thousand due to gains on the sale of other real estate and an increase in automated teller machine fees while trust and brokerage fees grew by due to increased commissions on the sale of investment products 
offsetting these gains was a million decline in loan service fees due primarily to a thousand write down in the value of interest only receivables as a result of an increase in the company s charge off assumptions for the and securitization trusts and a thousand decrease in servicing fees due to anticipated principal paydowns of home equity loans and reductions in related fees 
deposit service fees decreased by thousand due to a decline in net nsf fees collected 
other expenses for the year ended december   other expenses increased by million to million from million in merger expenses incurred in fourth quarter of million account for most of this increase 
salaries and employee benefits grew by million to million  from million in due to the company s continued investment in people and employees added through the fsl acquisition 
offsetting these increases were declines in other operating expense  occupancy and equipment expense and advertising and marketing expense of million  thousand and thousand  respectively 
for the year ended december   other expenses increased million to million from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to operating costs associated with the three additional branches and personnel acquired through the acquisition of damen financial corporation and its subsidiary damen national bank 
salaries and employee benefits increased million  other operating expenses increased million and occupancy and equipment expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  advertising and marketing increased by million  reflecting increased advertising and marketing efforts  while intangible amortization expense declined by thousand  reflecting the company s accelerated intangible amortization method  which amortizes a greater amount of purchase premium related to the core deposit intangible in early years than in later years 
income taxes income tax expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the effective tax rate increased to for the year ended december   from in due to the non deductibility of certain merger costs and uncertainty relative to the realization of state net operating loss carryforwards 
for the year ended december   the company recorded income tax expense of million compared to million for the same period for income before taxes for the year ended december  decreased million compared to the same period for the effective tax rate decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   primarily due to the tax treatment of the increase in cash surrender value of life insurance 
investment securities the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to provide a source of earnings for liquidity management purposes  and to control interest rate risk 
in managing the portfolio  the company seeks to obtain the objectives of safety of principal  liquidity  diversification and maximized return on funds 
see liquidity and capital resources under item hereof and asset liability management under item a hereof 
the following table sets forth the amortized cost and fair value of the company s securities by accounting classification category and by type of security as indicated in thousands at december  at december  at december  amortized cost fair value amortized cost fair value amortized cost fair value securities available for sale us treasury securities us government agencies states and political subdivisions mortgage backed securities corporate bonds equity securities debt securities issued by foreign governments investment in equity lines of credit trusts total securities available for sale securities held to maturity us treasury securities us government agencies states and political subdivisions mortgage backed securities debt securities issued by foreign governments corporate securities total securities held to maturity at december  the company transferred held to maturity securities with an amortized cost of million to available for sale securities and recorded as a component of equity  unrealized gain of thousand net of thousand of deferred taxes 
us treasury securities and securities of us government agencies generally consist of fixed rate securities with maturities of three months to three years 
states and political subdivisions investment securities consist of investment grade and local non rated issues with maturities of less than five years 
the average term of mortgage backed securities generally ranges between five and ten years  however  certain mortgage backed securities include maturities greater than ten years 
corporate bonds include maturities ranging from five years through ten years and after ten years 
investment securities held to maturity declined by million as of december   as the company s held to maturity portfolio was reclassified as available for sale during the year upon the implementation of sfas no 
the fair value of such investment securities was million as of the transfer date 
there were no securities of any single issuer  other than us government agencies and mortgage backed securities  which had a book value in excess of of the company s stockholders equity at december  the following table sets forth certain information regarding contractual maturities and the weighted average yields of the company s securities portfolio at december  dollars in thousands due in one year or less due after one year through five years due after five years through ten years due after ten years balance weighted average yield balance weighted average yield balance weighted average yield balance weighted average yield securities available for sale us treasury securities us government agencies states and political subdivision mortgage backed securities corporate bonds equity securities debt securities issued by foreign governments investments in equity lines of credit trusts total yield is reflected on a fully tax equivalent basis utilizing a tax rate

loan portfolio the following table sets forth the composition of the loan portfolio dollars in thousands at december  amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent commercial commercial loans collateralized by assignment of lease payments commercial real estate residential real estate construction real estate installment and other gross loans unearned income allowance for loan losses net loans net loans increased million to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase was due primarily to growth in the company s commercial real estate portfolio and lease banking business 
additional growth was provided by the approximately million in loans acquired through the fsl acquisition of which million were subsequently sold 
increases in the company s loan portfolio for the years through was primarily due to internal loan growth as well as the avondale merger and damen financial corporation acquisition in loan maturities the following table sets forth the maturity or repricing information for commercial and construction real estate loans outstanding at december  in thousands due in one year or less due after one year through five years due after five years fixed rate floating rate fixed rate floating rate fixed rate floating rate total commercial loans  commercial loans collateralized by assignment of lease payments and construction real estate loans asset quality the following table sets forth the amounts of non performing loans and non performing assets at the dates indicated dollars in thousands at december  non accruing loans loans days or more past due  still accruing interest total non performing loans other real estate owned other repossessed assets total non performing assets total non performing loans to total loans allowance for loan losses to non performing loans total non performing assets to total assets non performing loans non performing loans include i loans accounted for on a non accrual basis  ii accruing loans contractually past due days or more as to interest and principal  and iii loans whose terms have been renegotiated to provide reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
management reviews the loan portfolio for problem loans on an ongoing basis 
during the ordinary course of business  management becomes aware of borrowers that may not be able to meet the contractual requirements of loan agreements 
such loans are placed under close supervision with consideration given to placing the loan on a non accrual status  increasing the allowance for loan losses  and if appropriate partial or full charge off 
after a loan is placed on non accrual status  any current year interest previously accrued but not yet collected is reversed against current income 
if interest payments are received on non accrual loans  such payments will be applied to principal and not taken into income 
loans will not be placed back on accrual status unless all back interest and principal payments are made 
if interest on non accrual loans had been accrued  such income would have amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  none of these amounts were included in interest income during these periods 
the company s policy is to place loans days past due on non accrual status 
an exception is made when management believes the loan will become current and there is documented evidence of the borrower s ability to repay 
non accrual loans are further classified as impaired when underlying collateral is not sufficient to cover the loan balance and it is probable that the company will not fully collect all principal and interest 
non performing assets also consist of other repossessed assets and other real estate owned oreo 
oreo represents properties acquired through foreclosure or other proceedings and is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less the estimated cost of disposal 
oreo is evaluated regularly to ensure that the recorded amount is supported by its current fair value 
valuation allowances to reduce the carrying amount to fair value less estimated costs of disposal are recorded as necessary 
revenues and expenses from the operations of oreo and changes in the valuation are included in other income and other expenses on the income statement 
at december   total non performing assets increased million to million from million at december  due to increases in non performing loans and other real estate of million and thousand  respectively and partially offset by a thousand decline in other repossessed assets 
at december   non performing assets decreased million to million from million at december  due to declines of a thousand and thousand in non performing loans and other real estate owned  respectively  which were partially offset by a thousand increase in other repossessed assets 
the increase in loans days or more past due  still accruing interest of million from december  to december  is primarily due to one commercial real estate loan 
the loan is secured by a first lien on real estate with an estimated fair market value of million and cash collateral of million 
as of december   the loan was in non accrual 
allowance for loan losses 
management believes the allowance for loan losses accounting policy is critical to the portrayal and understanding of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
as such  selection and application of this critical accounting policy involves judgements  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans  based on an evaluation of the collectibility of loans and prior loss experience 
this evaluation also takes into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  the value of underlying collateral  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans  and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay 
while management uses the best information available to make its evaluation  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if there are significant changes in economic conditions 
in addition  as an integral part of their examination process regulatory agencies periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses and may require the company to make additions to the allowance based on their evaluation of information available at the time of their examinations 
the following table presents an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the years presented dollars in thousands year ended december  balance at beginning of year decreases resulting from sale of subsidiary additions resulting from purchase of loans additions resulting from mergers provision for loan losses charge offs commercial commercial loans collateralized by assignment of lease payments commercial real estate residential real estate construction real estate credit scored heloc installment and other total charge offs recoveries commercial commercial loans collateralized by assignment of lease payments commercial real estate residential real estate construction real estate credit scored heloc installment and other total recoveries net charge offs balance at december  total loans at december  ratio of allowance to total loans ratio of net charge offs to average loans net charge offs totaled million in  an increase of million from the increase was primarily due to the charge off of million in loans to four commercial customers 
in the first quarter of  the company added million of pooled home equity lines of credit to the loan portfolio through the purchase of a interest in the securitization trust and added million to the allowance for loan losses for these loans 
in the second quarter of  million was added to the allowance with the acquisition of fsl 
the provision for loan losses declined by million for the year ended december  compared to net charge offs totaled million in  a decline of million from the decrease was primarily due to charge offs incurred in on loans acquired through the merger with avondale federal savings bank 
the provision for loan losses increased million for the year ended compared to as a reflection of management s evaluation of non performing loans as well as growth in the company s commercial and lease banking businesses 
the following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the years presented and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans 
an allocation for a loan classification is only for internal analysis of the adequacy of the allowance and is not an indication of expected or anticipated losses dollars in thousands at december  amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent commercial commercial loans collateralized by assignment of lease payments commercial and residential real estate  including heloc loans construction real estate installment unallocated total the company maintains its allowance for loan losses at a level that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans based on an evaluation of the collectibility of loans and prior loss experience 
the company further uses a risk rating system to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
with this system  each loan is risk rated between one and nine  by the originating loan officer or loan committee  with one being the best case and nine being a loss or the worst case 
loan loss reserve factors are multiplied against the balances in each risk rating category to determine an appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses 
loans with risk ratings between six and eight are monitored much closer by the officers 
control of the company s loan quality is continually monitored by management and is reviewed by the loan committee of the company on a monthly basis  subject to oversight by the company s board of directors through its members who serve on the loan committee 
regulatory authorities conduct independent external review of the loan portfolio 
the company consistently applies its methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  but may make adjustments to its system based on historical information related to charge offs and management s evaluation of the current loan portfolio 
when adjustments are made  the loan committee carefully reviews them before they are implemented 
the unallocated reserve to total gross loans at december  and was and  respectively 
additions to the allowance for loan losses  which are charged to earnings through the provision for loan losses  are determined based on a variety of factors  including specific reserves on problem loans  current loan risk ratings  delinquent loans  historical loss experience and economic conditions in the company s market area 
although management believes the allowance for loan losses is sufficient to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio  there can be no assurance that the allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual future loan losses 
potential problem loans 
the company utilizes an internal asset classification system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem assets 
at each scheduled bank board of directors meeting  a watch list is presented  showing all loans listed as special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss 
an asset is classified substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and viewed as non bankable assets  worthy of charge off 
assets that do not currently expose the company to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories  but possess weaknesses that may or may not be within the control of the customer are deemed to be special mention 
the company s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the banks primary regulators  which can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances 
the fdic  in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies  has adopted an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan losses 
the policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of management for the assessment and establishment of adequate allowances and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation guidelines 
generally  the policy statement recommends that i institutions have effective systems and controls to identify  monitor and address asset quality problems  ii management has analyzed all significant factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio in a reasonable manner  and iii management has established acceptable allowance evaluation processes that meet the objectives set forth in the policy statement 
management believes it has established an adequate allowance for probable loan losses 
the company analyzes its process regularly  with modifications made if needed  and reports those results four times per year at board of directors meetings 
however  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing the company s loan portfolio  will not request the company to materially increase its allowance for loan losses at the time 
although management believes that adequate specific and general loan loss allowances have been established  actual losses are dependent upon future events and  as such  further additions to the level of specific and general loan loss allowances may become necessary 
the aggregate principal amounts of potential problem loans as of december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
included in these potential problem loan totals are non accrual  special mention  substandard and doubtful classifications  which comprise the watch list presented to the board of directors 
all loans classified as loss have been charged off 
loans in this category generally include loans that were classified for regulatory purposes 
as of december   the company had approximately million in performing lease loans and direct finance leases collectively k mart loans extended to k mart corporation 
k mart corporation filed for bankruptcy protection on january  the k mart loans are secured by revenue producing equipment with an original cost of million that was purchased and installed during the second half of while the k mart loans are currently performing in accordance with their terms  no assurance can be given that this will continue to be the case and such performance may depend on the terms of a reorganization plan for k mart 
it is therefore possible that the company will incur a loss with respect to all or a portion of the k mart loans 
interest only receivables in  and  avondale federal savings bank which was purchased in securitized certain home equity lines of credit to investors with limited recourse  retaining the right to service the underlying loans 
the securitizations were done using qualified special purpose entities securitization trusts 
upon the sale  the net carrying amount of the loans were removed from the balance sheet  and certain retained residual interests were recorded 
the retained interests included rights to service the loans that were sold the servicing rights and the rights to future cash flows the interest only receivables arising after the investors in the securitization trusts received their contractual return 
in addition  the company retained a security interest in the securitization trusts  reflecting the excess of the total amount of loans transferred to the trusts over the portion represented by certificates sold to investors 
through the avondale merger  the company acquired servicing rights related to these loans  the retained a security interest in the securitization trusts and interest only receivables 
the annual servicing fees received by the company approximate of the outstanding loan balance 
the investors and their securitization trusts have no recourse to the company s other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due 
most of the company s retained interest in the securitization trusts is generally restricted until investors have been fully paid and is subordinate to investor s interest 
the retained interest is included with securities available for sale and is reflected as investments in equity lines of credit trust 
the company estimates fair value of these securities by using prices paid for similar securities 
since the projected income from the servicing rights approximates the estimated cost of the company to service the loans  no asset was recorded 
income from servicing is recognized as earned pursuant to the terms of the servicing agreement and to the extent cash collections from the borrowers exceed payments to the investors 
cash collections in excess of the servicing rights income that is earned is next applied to the interest only receivables 
the value allocated to the interest only receivables is reduced and interest income is recorded assuming a constant yield based upon the discount rate used to estimate its fair value 
at the end of the estimated life of the securitization  the carrying value of the interest only receivables will be fully amortized 
because the company s retained residual interests are subordinated to the interests of the securitization investors  there is risk that the carrying value of the interest only receivables will not be fully recovered  resulting in a loss charged to earnings 
in addition  since actual credit losses may exceed projected credit losses over the life of the securitization  there is a risk that the value of the company s retained participation interest will not be fully realized  resulting in a loss charged to earnings 
recourse against the company for credit losses is limited to the amount of the sales proceeds that were not remitted by the securitization trust at the time of the initial sale of the loans 
at each reporting period  the fair value of the interest only receivables are re evaluated based upon current estimates and assumptions of the net present value of residual future cash flows net of remaining expected credit losses 
if this re evaluation results in fair values that are less than the amortized carrying value of the interest only receivables and if remaining projected cash flows are less than previously estimated  the carrying value is written down to fair value 
if the write down is determined to be other than temporary  the amount of the write down is charged against earnings for the current period 
finally  at each reporting period  new interest only receivable amortization schedules are revised based upon current estimates  assumptions  adjusted carrying values and revised constant yields 
judgements and assumptions that are most critical to the application of this accounting policy are estimated defaults  delinquencies and credit losses  projected prepayment speeds and discount rates 
these assumptions are based upon demonstrated credit and prepayment performance of the underlying loans 
these are  in turn  most highly influenced by general economic conditions  with the greatest adverse affect during economic downturns and periods of rapidly falling interest rates 
changes in assumptions and conditions could result in unexpected write downs of the residual interests as well as interest accruals and accretion that are less than historically experienced 
see also note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   interest only receivables were million 
the value of interest only receivables is subject to substantial credit  prepayment  and interest rate risk on the transferred financial assets 
on a quarterly basis  the company performs a review to determine the fair value of its interest only receivables 
as part of the review  the company reviews its assumptions of prepayment speeds  discount rates and the remaining anticipated credit losses 
the following table shows the results of the company s assumptions used to estimate the fair value at december  dollars in thousands interest only receivables pools adjustable adjustable adjustable estimated fair value prepayment speed remaining weighted average life in years expected remaining credit losses residual cash flows discounted at loans outstanding at december  rates for these loans are adjusted based on the prime rate as published in the wall street journal 
the remaining weighted average life in years of prepayable assets is calculated by summing a the principal collections expected in each future year multiplied by b the number of years until collection  and then dividing that sum by the initial principal balance 
this is not explicitly assumed but it reflects the overall effect of prepayment assumptions 
assumed remaining credit losses over the life remaining on the loans outstanding at december  are thousand  thousand  and million for  and  respectively 
the estimated credit loss percentage is derived by dividing the remaining credit losses by the related loan balance outstanding in the pool 
during  the company acquired in the market of the securities outstanding in the securitization trust held by investors 
after the acquisition  the company applied purchase accounting and the securitization trust and its activities were consolidated into the company s financial statements 
management believes the interest only receivable accounting policy is critical to the portrayal and understanding of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
as such  selection and application of this critical accounting policy involves judgements  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood 
sources of funds general 
deposits  short term and long term borrowings  loan and investment security repayments and prepayments  proceeds from the sale of securities  and cash flows generated from operations are the primary sources of the company s funds for lending  investing  leasing and other general purposes 
loan repayments are a relatively predictable source of funds except during periods of significant interest rate declines  while deposit flows tend to fluctuate with prevailing interests rates  money markets conditions  general economic conditions and competition 
deposits 
the company offers a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms 
the company s core deposits consist of checking accounts  now accounts  money market accounts  savings accounts and non public certificates of deposit 
these deposits  along with public fund deposits  brokered deposits  and short term and long term borrowings are used to support the company s asset base 
the company s deposits are obtained predominantly from the geographic trade areas surrounding each of the company s office locations 
the company relies primarily on customer service and long standing relationships with customers to attract and retain deposits  however  market interest rates and rates offered by competing financial institutions significantly affect the company s ability to attract and retain deposits 
the following table sets forth the maturities of certificates of deposit and other time deposits  and over at december  in thousands at december  certificates of deposit  and over maturing within three months after three but within six months after six but within twelve months after twelve months total certificates of deposit  and over other time deposits  and over maturing within three months after three but within six months after six but within twelve months after twelve months total other time deposits  and over borrowings 
the company has access to a variety of borrowing sources and uses short term and long term borrowings to support its asset base 
short term borrowings include federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  us treasury demand notes  federal home loan bank advances and correspondent bank lines of credit

long term borrowings increased to million at december  from million at december  liquidity bank liquidity 
liquidity management is monitored by the asset liability management committee and board of directors of each of the banks  who review historical funding requirements  current liquidity position  sources and stability of funding  marketability of assets  options for attracting additional funds  and anticipated future funding needs  including the level of unfunded commitments 
the banks primary sources of funds are retail and commercial deposits  short term and long term borrowings  public funds and funds generated from operations 
funds from operations include principal and interest payments received on loans and securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities provide an indication of the timing of the receipt of funds  changes in interest rates  economic conditions and competition strongly influence mortgage prepayment rates and deposit flows  reducing the predictability of the timing on sources of funds 
the banks have no required regulatory liquidity ratios to maintain  however  they adhere to a liquidity policy  approved by their board of directors  who set certain guidelines for liquidity purposes 
this policy requires that the banks maintain the following liquidity ratios liquidity ratio defined as cash  short term investments  marketable securities and investment grade scheduled lease loan payments due in one year or less divided by deposits plus short term liabilities greater than 
dependency ratio defined as net potentially volatile liabilities divided by total earning assets less short term investments should not exceed for more than days 
loans minus leases to deposits less than loans to deposits less than 
at december   the banks were in substantial compliance with the foregoing policy 
generally  when the banks liquidity ratios fall outside policy guidelines  loans are sold to provide a source of funds and reduce the volume of total loans 
at december   the banks had outstanding loan origination commitments and unused commercial and retail lines of credit of million 
the banks anticipate that they will have sufficient funds available to meet current origination and other lending commitments 
certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature within one year totaled billion at december  the banks expect to retain a substantial majority of these certificates of deposit 
in the event that additional short term liquidity is needed  the banks have established relationships with several large regional banks to provide short term borrowings in the form of federal funds purchases 
while there were no firm lending commitments in place  the banks have borrowed  and management believes that they could again borrow  million for a short time from these banks on a collective basis 
additionally  mb financial bank and union bank  na are members of the federal home loan bank fhlb and have the ability to borrow from the fhlb 
as a contingency plan for significant funding needs  the asset liability management committee may also consider the sale of investment securities  selling securities under agreement to repurchase or the temporary curtailment of lending activities 
corporation liquidity 
the company s main sources of liquidity at the holding company level are dividends from the banks and a line of credit maintained with a large regional correspondent bank in the amount of million 
as of december   the company had million undrawn and available under its line of credit 
the following table summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations and other potential funding needs at december  time deposits long term debt operating leases total thereafter total commitments to extend credit the banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal and state banking agencies  which affect their ability to pay dividends to the company 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s financial statements 
additionally  the banks follow an internal company policy which provides that dividends paid to the company by a bank cannot exceed an amount that would cause the bank s total risk based capital  tier risk based capital and tier leverage capital ratios to fall below  and  respectively 
the minimum ratios required for the bank to be considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes are  and  respectively 
at december   the banks could pay a combined million in dividends and comply with the company s internal policy regarding minimum regulatory capital ratios 
in addition to adhering to the company s internal policy  there are regulatory restrictions on the ability of national banks to pay dividends

capital resources the banks are subject to the risk based capital regulations administered by the banking regulatory agencies 
the risk based capital guidelines are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks to account for off balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
under the regulations  assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with appropriate weights 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
under the prompt corrective action regulations  to be adequately capitalized a bank must maintain minimum ratios of total capital to risk weighted assets of  tier capital to risk weighted assets of  and tier capital to total assets of 
failure to meet these capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary  actions by regulators  which  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the banks financial statements 
as of december   the most recent notification from the federal banking regulators categorized the banks as well capitalized 
a well capitalized institution must maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of at least  a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of at least  a minimum ratio of tier capital to total assets of at least and must not be subject to any written order  agreement or directive requiring it to meet or maintain a specific capital level 
there are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the banks capital classification 
the company  on a consolidated basis  must maintain a minimum ratio of tier capital to total assets of  and a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management the company s net interest income is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that it can vary based on changes in the general level of interest rates 
it is the company s policy to maintain an acceptable level of interest rate risk over a range of possible changes in interest rates while remaining responsive to market demand for loan and deposit products 
the strategy employed by the company to manage its interest rate risk is to measure its risk using an asset liability simulation model and adjust the maturity of securities in its investment portfolio to manage that risk 
also  to limit risk  the company generally does not make fixed rate loans or accept fixed rate deposits with terms of more than five years 
interest rate risk can also be measured by analyzing the extent to which the repricing of assets and liabilities are mismatched to create an interest sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  therefore  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap position would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are anticipated by the company  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined based on the earlier of the term to repricing or the term to repayment of the asset or liability 
the table is intended to provide an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december  on the basis of contractual maturities and scheduled rate adjustments within a three month period and subsequent selected time intervals 
the loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be reinvested and or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and rate adjustments on adjustable rate loans 
loan and investment securities contractual maturities and amortization reflect modest prepayment assumptions 
while now  money market and savings deposit accounts have adjustable rates  it is assumed that the interest rates on these accounts will not adjust immediately to changes in other interest rates 
therefore  the table is calculated assuming that these accounts will reprice as follows in the first three months  in the next nine months  and after one year dollars in thousands time to maturity or repricing days days years over years total interest earning assets loans investment securities federal funds sold interest bearing deposits with banks total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities now and money market deposit accounts savings deposits time deposits short term borrowings long term borrowings total interest bearing liabilities rate sensitive assets rsa rate sensitive liabilities rsl cumulative gap gap rsa rsl rsa total assets rsl total assets gap total assets gap rsa certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
therefore  the company does not rely solely on a gap analysis to manage its interest rate risk  but rather it uses what it believes to be the more reliable simulation model relating to changes in net interest income 
based on simulation modeling at december  and  the company s net interest income would change over a one year time period due to changes in interest rates as follows dollars in thousands change in net interest income over one year horizon at december  at december  changes in levels of interest rates dollar change percentage change dollar change percentage change simulations used by the company assume the following changes in interest rates are immediate 
it is the company s policy that interest rate exposure due to a interest rate rise or fall be limited to of the company s annual net interest income as forecasted by the simulation model 
as demonstrated by the table above  the company s interest rate risk exposure was within this policy at december  changes in net interest income between december  and december  reflect changes in the composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  related interest rates  repricing frequencies  and the fixed or variable characteristics of the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities
