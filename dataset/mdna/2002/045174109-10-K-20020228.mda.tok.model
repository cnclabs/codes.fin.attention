critical accounting policies revenue the company generally recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
if the company has doubt about the collectibility of revenue at the time it is earned  such revenue is deferred until cash has been received 
revenues associated with our web properties group include all revenue streams generated from the web sites we own and operate  as well as from the syndication of services offered on our sites to other companies sites 
they consist primarily of advertising revenues and paid placement revenues 
advertising offered ranges from run of site banner advertisements and sponsorships to keyword targeting and branded content 
revenue derived from such arrangements is recognized during the period that the service is provided  provided that no significant obligations remain at the end of the period 
such obligations typically include the guarantee of a minimum number of impressions or times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of the company s online properties 
to the extent the minimum guaranteed impressions are not delivered  the company defers recognition of the corresponding revenue until the remaining guaranteed impressions levels are achieved 
syndication services offered range from the sale of promotional material on behalf of partners to the syndication of our web wide search technology to portals  infomediaries  and content and destination sites 
syndication fees primarily consist of revenue sharing arrangements  fixed or fee per use arrangements  and revenues are recognized as the service is delivered 
revenues from revenue sharing arrangements are recorded net of amounts paid to syndication partners  except when the company acts as the primary obligor in the arrangement and bears risk with respect to the inventory of promotional space and credit risk  in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 which expense is recognized as a cost of sale and revenue is recorded on a gross basis 
revenues from paid placements are generated when a user clicks on the answer that links to a merchant s web site on a cost per click  or cpc basis 
revenues from our jeeves solutions group are derived from two sources software license revenues and  services revenue 
software license revenues are generated from companies licensing the rights to use our natural language and customer intelligence technologies for use on corporate websites 
services revenue is generated from sales of maintenance agreements  consulting services and training services 
license revenue we recognize software license revenue in accordance with aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  sop as amended by statement of position sop provides specific industry guidance and stipulates that revenue recognized from software arrangements is to be allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the relative fair value of the elements 
under sop  the determination of fair value is based on the objective evidence that is specific to the vendor 
if such evidence of fair value for each element of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the ask jeeves  inc arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does exist or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered 
we recognize license revenue over the core implementation period if implementation services are included in the original license arrangement and are considered to be essential to the functionality of the software 
as a result  even where we have a signed license agreement for the purchase of our software and have delivered the software  license revenue recognition depends on whether we have begun core implementation 
for license agreements under which we have no implementation responsibility  or where implementation is not considered to be essential to the functionality of the software  we recognize revenue upon delivery of the software 
examples of situations under which we have no implementation responsibility include additional license sales to existing customers or customers who elect to use internal or third party resources to implement the software 
in software license arrangements where a service element is critical to the functionality of the software  license  implementation and service fees are recognized ratably over the life of the arrangement  commencing upon service implementation 
license payments from our joint ventures are recorded as deferred revenues and are being recognized as revenues on a straight line basis over three to four year periods 
service revenue we generally provide consulting and training services on a time and materials basis 
we provide maintenance and support services under renewable  term maintenance agreements  which we price as a percentage of our license fees 
maintenance and support fee revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual term  generally twelve months  commencing from the implementation of service 
amounts invoiced prior to service implementation are recorded as deferred revenue  with recognition commencing upon service implementation 
impairment of long lived assets the company s long lived assets include goodwill and other intangible assets 
at december   the company had million of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangibles the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
effective as of january  the company will adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas and will be required to analyze its goodwill for impairment issues during the first six months of fiscal  and then on a periodic basis thereafter

paid placement revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  web properties revenues were impacted by softer demand for online advertising  most significantly with respect to banner advertising  resulting in a decrease in rates paid 
the decrease was partially offset by revenue from new ad products  such as branded animation and interstitials  which were introduced during the year 
traffic on our properties continued its strong growth with total page views increasing billion to billion during and unique users increasing over december to million in december the company launched a series of enhanced ad products during the second half of and plans to release additional products during that we expect will result in increased advertising rates in we also expect the addition of media revenues  resulting from the consolidation of the ask jeeves uk web property beginning in the first quarter of  to increase web properties revenue during the year 
the increase in revenues for over is due primarily to the substantial increases in inventory available for sale to advertisers due to the increases in unique users and page views in as compared with as of december   our combined web properties attracted an audience of million unique monthly users who viewed an average of approximately million web pages per day on ask jeeves branded online properties  compared to million unique users as of december  jeeves solutions revenue jeeves solutions revenues decreased to million as compared with million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

service revenue in was impacted by the decrease in new customer bookings during the year 
a significant portion of services revenues result from the provision of consulting and training services 
such services frequently are associated with new customer bookings 
when customers renew subscription based contracts  such renewals may not result in additional consulting service revenue 
the increase in revenues in over is due to an increase in the number of commercial customers using our jeeves solutions technology and a substantial increase in revenue from international licensing arrangements with our joint ventures 
ask jeeves  inc we expect the challenging advertising and information technology markets to continue into the near future 
further  we dissolved our spanish language venture and acquired full ownership of our united kingdom joint venture  resulting in the termination of those license arrangements 
these licenses accounted for revenues of approximately million during the year ending december  the termination of these license revenues will be offset by media revenues from the consolidation of the ask jeeves uk web property  as noted in the discussion above

with the assistance of independent valuation experts  we performed asset impairment tests at the enterprise level  the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows related to our acquired intangible assets and goodwill 
the tests were performed by comparing the expected undiscounted cash flows for a four year period  plus a terminal value for future cash flows  to the carrying amount of the long lived assets resulting from purchase business combinations 
based on the results of these tests  we determined that long lived assets initially recorded in connection with our business combinations were impaired 
we measured the impairment loss related to long lived assets based on the amount by which the carrying amount of such assets exceeded its fair value 
measurement of fair value was based on an analysis by us  with assistance from independent valuation experts  of the future discounted cash flows at the enterprise level 
in performing this analysis  we used the best information available in the circumstances including reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
the discounted cash flow analysis considered the likelihood of possible outcomes and was based on our best estimate of projected future cash flows  including terminal value cash flows expected to result from the disposition of the asset at the end of its useful life  discounted at a rate of percent 
the discount rate was based on historical risk premiums required by investors for companies of our size  industry and capital structure and included risk factors specific to us

the entire amount of the settlement was included in the company s restructuring charges in the year ended december  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations in operating results our operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
factors that may adversely affect our results of operations include our ability to obtain new corporate customers  the length of the development cycle for corporate customers and the timing of revenue recognition with respect to contracts with corporate customers  our ability to obtain new advertising contracts  maintain existing ones  and effectively manage our advertising inventory  the number of questions asked and answered on our websites and on the web sites of our corporate customers  our ability to attract and retain advertisers and our ability to link our partners to potential customers  rate changes for advertising on our web sites  marketing expenses and technology infrastructure costs as well as other costs that we may incur as we expand our operations 
seasonal and other fluctuations in demand for our services and for advertising space on our web sites  our ability to develop and introduce new technology  announcements and new technology introductions by our competitors  our ability to attract and retain key personnel  and costs relating to possible acquisitions and integration of technologies or businesses  because of the foregoing factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
as internet advertising continues the transition from an emerging to a more developed market  seasonal and cyclical patterns may develop in our industry that may also affect our revenues 
for example  we have historically experienced stronger periods of growth in the second and fourth quarters of the year 
similar to traditional media  this may result in our advertising sales being lower during summer vacation period 
seasonality in the retail industry and in internet service usage is likely to cause quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations and could harm our business

fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted by increases in interest rates 
floating rate securities may produce less income than anticipated if interest rates fall 
as a result  changes in interest rates may cause us to incur losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value or may result in lower than anticipated investment income 
our investment portfolio is categorized as available for sale and accordingly is presented at fair value on the balance sheet 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate  market and credit risk in the investment portfolio with investment policies and procedures that limit such things as term  credit rating and the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
during the year ended december   the effects of changes in interest rates on the fair market value of our marketable investment securities and our earnings were insignificant 
further  we believe that the impact on the fair market value of our securities and our earnings from a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would not be significant
