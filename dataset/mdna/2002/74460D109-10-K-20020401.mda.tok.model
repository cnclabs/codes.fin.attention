item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
forward looking statements when used within this document  the words expects  believes  anticipates  should  estimates  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of that term in section a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and in section f of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors  which may cause the actual results and performance of the company to be materially different from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
such factors described in item a  risk factors  include the impact of competition from new and existing storage and commercial facilities which could impact rents and occupancy levels at the company s facilities  the company s ability to evaluate  finance  and integrate acquired and developed properties into the company s existing operations  the company s ability to effectively compete in the markets in which it does business  the impact of the regulatory environment as well as national  state  and local laws and regulations including  without limitation  those governing real estate investment trusts  the acceptance by consumers of the containerized storage concept  the impact of general economic conditions upon rental rates and occupancy levels at the company s facilities  and the availability of permanent capital at attractive rates 
critical accounting policy impairment of long lived assets substantially all of the company s assets consist of long lived assets  including real estate  the assets associated with the containerized storage business  goodwill  and other intangible assets 
we annually evaluate our long lived assets for impairment 
this evaluation includes identifying indicators of impairment 
when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted future cash flows of the assets are less than the carrying amount  an impairment charge is recorded 
the company has determined at december  that no such impairments existed and  accordingly  no impairment charges have been recorded 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has recently issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets sfas 
each of these statements addresses the procedures to be followed in evaluating and recording impairment losses with respect to long lived assets 
the company will adopt each of these statements in the beginning of its fiscal year ended december   and expects that there will be no material impact from these statements with respect to impairment losses 
however  future events could cause us to conclude that our long lived assets are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
overview the self storage industry is highly fragmented and is composed predominantly of numerous local and regional operators 
competition in the markets in which we operate is significant and is increasing from additional development of storage facilities in many markets which may negatively impact occupancy levels and rental rates at the storage facilities 
however  we believe that we possess several distinguishing characteristics which enable us to compete effectively with other owners and operators 
we are the largest owner and operator of self storage facilities in the united states with ownership interests as of december  in  storage facilities containing approximately million net rentable square feet 
all of our facilities are operated under the public storage brand name  which we believe is the most recognized and established name in the storage industry 
located in the major metropolitan markets of states  our storage facilities are geographically diverse  giving us national recognition and prominence 
this concentration establishes us as one of the dominant providers of storage space in most markets in which we operate and enables us to use a variety of promotional activities  such as television advertising as well as targeted discounting and referrals  which are generally not economically viable to most of our competitors 
in addition  we believe that the geographic diversity of the portfolio reduces the impact from regional economic downturns and provides a greater degree of revenue stability 
we will continue to focus our growth strategies on i improving the operating performance of our existing traditional self storage properties  ii increasing our ownership of storage facilities through additional investments  iii improving the operating performance of the containerized storage business and iv participating in the growth of ps business parks  inc major elements of these strategies are as follows o we will continue to focus upon enhancing the operating performance of our existing traditional self storage properties  primarily through increases in revenues achieved through the telephone reservation center and associated marketing efforts 
these increases in revenue levels for are expected to result primarily from improvements in occupancy levels rather than significant increases in realized rent per occupied square foot 
during  the consistent group of facilities defined below exhibited growth in rental income and net operating income of and  respectively  over the prior year 
we do not expect to maintain this high level of growth in o we expect to continue our development program 
over the past three years  the company and related development joint ventures opened a total of storage facilities at a cost of approximately million  containing approximately  net rentable square feet 
the company has a total of projects identified for openings after december  at an estimated total cost of million 
these projects which include two facilities being developed by our second development joint venture are comprised of storage facilities for which we have acquired the land at december  total estimated costs upon completion of million  storage facilities identified for which we have not acquired the land estimated costs upon completion of approximately million and seven expansions of existing self storage facilities total estimated costs upon completion of million 
in addition  we have parcels of land held for development totaling million for which currently we have no specific development plans 
generally  the construction period takes nine to months  followed by an estimated month fill up process 
throughout the fill up period  we experience earnings dilution to the extent of our interest in the developed properties 
o we will acquire facilities from third parties 
during  we acquired self storage facilities from third parties 
during  we acquired one storage facility from a third party 
we believe that our national telephone reservation system and marketing organization present an opportunity for increased revenues through higher occupancies of the properties acquired from third parties  as well as cost efficiencies through greater critical mass 
with the exception of the acquisition of storage trust in  we have not acquired a significant number of facilities from third parties 
o we will acquire equity interests in entities owning storage facilities that we manage and already have an equity interest in  as they become available from time to time 
the pool of such available acquisitions has continued to decrease as we have acquired such remaining interests over the last several years 
such potential remaining acquisition opportunities at december  include the remaining equity interests that we do not own in the entities described as other equity investments as described in note to the company s financial statements  as well as the other partnership interests as described in note to the company s financial statements for the year ended december  o we will continue to focus on improving the operations of the containerized storage operations 
at december   of the facilities operated by pspud are operated in owned facilities  substantially all of which are facilities that combine containerized storage and traditional self storage 
these owned facilities have replaced facilities which were previously leased from third parties reducing third party lease expense 
we believe that these facilities may offer efficiencies and a more effective method to meet customers needs than a stand alone containerized storage facility 
the company and pspud at december  are developing three additional facilities which will replace three of the existing leased facilities 
the company currently has no plans to replace the leased facilities that will remain after completion of the three remaining planned combination facilities 
o through our investment in ps business parks  inc  we will continue to participate in the growth of this company s investment in approximately million net rentable square feet of commercial space at december  results of operations net income and earnings per common share net income for  and was   and  respectively 
the increase in net income was primarily the result of improved property operations  reduced operating losses from the containerized storage business  and the acquisition of additional real estate investments during  and the impact of these items was offset partially by an increased allocation of income to minority interests as a result of the issuance of preferred operating partnership units  referred to below combined with an increase in depreciation and general and administration expense during and when compared to during  our capital raising activities included the issuance of approximately million in preferred operating partnership units in one of our controlled partnerships million of which was repurchased in 
unlike distributions to preferred shareholders  distributions to preferred unitholders are presented as minority interest in income and a reduction in computing the company s net income 
primarily as a result of these preferred distributions  minority interest in income increased to  and  for and  respectively  as compared to  for net income allocable to common shareholders for  and was   and  respectively 
on a diluted basis  net income was per common share based on diluted weighted average common equivalent shares outstanding of  for  per common share based on diluted weighted average common equivalent shares outstanding of  for and per common share based on diluted weighted average common equivalent shares outstanding of  for the increase in net income per common share in as compared to is primarily due to a reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding due to our share repurchase activities 
the decrease in net income per common share in as compared to reflects the inclusion of  common equivalent shares related to the company s class b common shares in  but not in  as described more fully below 
in computing net income allocable to common shareholders for each period  aggregate dividends paid to the holders of the equity stock  series a and preferred equity securities have been deducted in determining net income allocable to the common shareholders 
distributions paid to the holders of the equity stock  series a totaled  in   in and none in distributions paid to preferred shareholders totaled  in   in and  in commencing january   the company s  class b common shares outstanding began to participate in distributions of the company s earnings 
distributions per share of class b common stock are equal to of the per share distribution paid to the company s regular common shares 
as a result of this participation in distributions of earnings  for purposes of computing net income per common share  the company began to include   x class b common shares in the weighted average common equivalent shares effective january  weighted average diluted shares for the year ended december  does not include any shares with respect to the class b common stock as these shares did not participate in distributions of the company s earnings prior to january  real estate operations self storage operations our self storage operations are by far the largest component of our operations  representing approximately of rental revenues generated during at the end of  we had a total of self storage facilities included in our consolidated financial statements 
since that time we have increased the number of self storage facilities by facilities  facilities and facilities 
as a result of significant acquisitions and development of self storage facilities over the past three years  year over year comparisons as presented on the consolidated statements of income with respect to our self storage operations are not meaningful 
to enhance year over year comparisons  the following table summarizes  and the ensuing discussion describes  the operating results of i self storage facilities that are reflected in the financial statements for the entire three years ended december  the consistent group  ii development facilities that were opened during the three years ended december  the developed facilities  iii facilities that were acquired in the three years ended december  and continued to be owned at december  the acquired facilities  iv facilities that were owned throughout the three years ended december  but were not stabilized  the expansion facilities and v facilities that were disposed of during the three years ended december  the disposed facilities self storage operations summary year ended december  year ended december  percentage percentage change change dollar amounts in thousands rental income a consistent group b     acquired facilities c     expansion facilities d     developed facilities e    disposed facilities f     total rental income     cost of operations consistent group     acquired facilities     expansion facilities     developed facilities    disposed facilities  total cost of operations     net operating income consistent group     acquired facilities     expansion facilities     developed facilities  disposed facilities    total net operating income     depreciation     operating income     number of self storage facilities at end of period     net rentable square feet at end of period     a rental income includes late charges and administrative fees

b the consistent group includes facilities with  net rentable square feet that were owned throughout the three years ended december   and operated at a mature  stabilized occupancy level throughout the periods presented 
see below for discussion of consistent group operating results 
c the acquired facilities includes facilities with  net rentable square feet that were acquired in the three year period ending december  and still owned as of december  substantially all of these facilities were mature  stabilized facilities at the time of their acquisition 
d the expansion facilities includes facilities with  net rentable square feet that  while owned for the entire three year period ending december   had operating results that were not comparable throughout the periods presented due to expansions in their net rentable square or their conversion into combination facilities 
such construction activities can cause a drop in revenue levels  as existing capacity is made unavailable in order to accommodate construction activities 
the company has completed construction on projects with a total cost of  in   in  and  in with respect to such expansion and conversion efforts 
e the developed facilities includes facilities with  net rentable square feet that were developed and opened in the three year period ending december  at a total cost of million 
these facilities were all still owned as of december  f the disposed facilities include facilities that were disposed of in the three year period ending december   primarily properties condemned by governmental agencies or acquired in the storage trust merger that were not deemed compatible with the company s operations 
self storage operations consistent group of facilities at december   we owned self storage facilities with approximately  net rentable square feet that operated at a stabilized level of operations throughout the three year period 
revenues and expenses with respect to these properties are set forth in the above self storage operations table under the caption  consistent group 
the following table sets forth certain additional operating data with respect to the consistent group of facilities selected operating data for the consistent group of facilities facilities year ended december  year ended december  percentage percentage change change dollar amounts in thousands  except rents per square foot weighted average occupancy a realized annual rent per square foot b late charges and administrative fees     promotional discounts     gross margin a occupancies in the above table represent weighted average occupancy levels over the entire fiscal year 
the average occupancy level at february  was as compared to at february  b realized annual rent per square foot is computed by dividing rental income  including late charges and administrative fees  by the weighted average occupied square footage for the period 
as indicated on the self storage operations table above  the consistent group s net operating income increased in as compared to and in as compared to rental income increased in as compared to and in as compared to cost of operations increased in as compared to and in as compared to we do not expect to maintain this level of growth in either as to net operating income or rental income 
the increase in rental income is attributable to a increase in realized rent per occupied square foot for as compared to and for as compared to increases in rental income were partially offset by reductions in weighted average occupancy levels 
higher realized rent per occupied square foot was achieved through more aggressive pricing of our self storage space offset by a reduction in occupancy levels 
during  we increased rents charged to new tenants and significantly reduced the level of discounts offered to new tenants 
promotional discounts for  and totaled   and  respectively 
in addition  during  we increased the level of rent charged to our existing tenant base in many markets 
we believe that our ability to raise rents and reduce promotional discounts and thereby increase rental income during was facilitated by more aggressive marketing efforts  including an increase in consistent group television advertising expenditures for totaling  as well as an increase in the intensity of our yellow page advertising  and the continuing impact of our efforts over the last several years to improve the value of the public storage brand  most significantly through the completion of our program to enhance our visual icon and to modernize the appearance of our self storage facilities 
we believe that principally as a result of our more aggressive rental rates and reductions in the amount of promotional discounts  and partially as a result of the national economic contraction discussed below  our weighted average occupancy levels decreased during as compared to our occupancy levels through the first two months of fiscal continued to trend downward  with the consistent group s average occupancy level at at february  as compared to at february  while the occupancy level at february  is significantly lower than the average occupancy levels experienced during the year  some decreases in occupancy are expected due to minor seasonal fluctuations in occupancies 
occupancies are generally higher in the summer months than in the winter months 
we therefore believe that the comparison of occupancies at february  versus that at february  provides a more meaningful measure of occupancy trends 
we believe that the national economic contraction has also contributed to our decreasing occupancies  however  it is difficult to isolate the impact of the downturn from our aforementioned pricing decisions 
while there can be no assurance  we believe that the potential impact of regional downturns are partially mitigated by the geographic diversification and quality locations of our facilities 
our storage facilities are geographically diversified and are located primarily in or near major metropolitan markets in states 
we are continuously evaluating our call volume  reservation activity  and move in move out rates for each of our markets relative to our marketing activities and rental rates 
in addition  we are evaluating market supply and demand factors and based upon these analyses we are continuing to adjust our marketing activities  and are currently reducing rental rates charged to new incoming tenants in an effort to increase our occupancy levels 
cost of operations includes all direct and indirect costs of operating  marketing and managing the facilities 
the following table summarizes major operating expenses with respect to the consistent group in thousands property payroll expense    property taxes    repairs and maintenance    advertising    telephone reservation center costs    utilities    management  office  insurance  and other expenses    total cost of operations    increases in advertising cost include the impact of expanded yellow page advertising in telephone directories 
the increase in advertising cost in as compared to also includes the impact of a  increase in consistent group television advertising expenditures 
promotional advertising is an important part of our operational strategy 
our advertising activities have increased customer call volume into our national reservation system  where one of our representatives discusses with the customer space requirements  price and location preferences and also informs the customer of other products and services provided by the company and its subsidiaries 
self storage operations acquired facilities as of december   we had facilities with  net rentable square feet that we acquired in and in connection with business combinations described more fully in note to the company s financial statements  as well as certain third party acquisitions of facilities 
substantially all of these facilities were mature  stabilized facilities at the time of their acquisition 
the operations of these facilities are included in the above table under the caption acquired facilities 
during  the company acquired one operating self storage facility for an aggregate cost of million 
included in the above table for  under the caption acquired facilities  are revenues of  and cost of operations of  with respect to this facility 
rental income and cost of operations increased significantly in compared to  as the operations only reflect a partial year s operating results for the facilities acquired in while the operations reflect a full year s operations with respect to those facilities 
in addition  the operations include the incremental operating results for those additional facilities acquired in similarly  rental income and cost of operations increased significantly in as compared to due to the improvement in operations for those properties owned throughout the two periods the acquisitions  a full year s operations with respect to the property acquisition are reflected in as opposed to a partial year in and to a lesser extent  the incremental operations from the aformentioned acquisition of a property in self storage operations expansion facilities throughout the three year period ended december   the company has expanded certain real estate facilities that it previously owned or converted them to combination facilities 
such construction activities can cause a drop in revenue levels  as existing capacity is made unavailable in order to accommodate construction activities 
primarily as a result of these expansion activities  of these facilities with  net rentable square feet which includes the expanded space had results that were not comparable in each of the three years ended december  the operating results for these facilities are presented in the self storage operations table above under the caption  expansion facilities 
we completed construction on projects with a total cost of  in   in  and  in with respect to these expansions 
self storage operations developed facilities during the past three years  we have opened newly developed self storage facilities in  in  in with  net rentable square feet and a total cost of approximately million  whose operating results are reflected in the self storage operations table under the caption  developed facilities 
unlike many other forms of real estate  we are unable to pre lease our newly developed facilities due to the nature of our tenants 
accordingly  at the time a newly developed facility first opens for operation the facility is entirely vacant generating no rental income 
it takes approximately months for a newly developed facility to fill up and reach a targeted occupancy level of approximately 
at december   the developed facilities had an average occupancy level of approximately 
property operating expenses are substantially fixed 
the rental revenue of a newly developed facility will generally not cover its property operating expenses excluding depreciation until the facility has reach an occupancy level of approximately 
however  at that occupancy level  the rental revenues from the facility are still not sufficient to cover related depreciation expense and cost of capital with respect to the facility s development cost our blended cost of capital is approximately 
during construction of the facility  we capitalize interest costs and include such cost as part of the overall development cost of the facility 
once the facility is opened for operations interest is no longer capitalized 
due to the relationship between the generation of rental income and immediate recognition of expenses upon opening of a facility  our development activities have had a negative impact on our net income 
we estimate that our net income for has been impacted negatively as a result of our development activities by approximately   and  in the years ended december    and  respectively  primarily representing the difference between the revenues of the developed facilities and the related costs denoted above 
these amounts include approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively  in depreciation expense 
we continue to develop facilities  despite the short term earnings dilution experienced during the stabilization period  because we believe that the ultimate returns on developed facilities are favorable 
in addition  we believe that it is advantageous for us to continue to expand our asset base and benefit from the resultant increased critical mass  with facilities that will improve our portfolio s overall average construction and location quality 
we expect that over at least the next months  the developed facilities will continue to have a negative impact to our earnings 
furthermore  the facilities in our development pipeline described in liquidity and capital resources acquisition and development of facilities that will be opened for operation over the next months will also negatively impact our earnings until they reach a stabilized occupancy level 
self storage operations disposed facilities during the three year period ended december   we disposed of facilities 
no further operations will be reflected on the company s financial statements after december  with respect to these facilities 
these properties consisted primarily of facilities condemned by governmental agencies or acquired in the storage trust merger that were not deemed compatible with the company s operations 
commercial property operations commercial property operations included in the consolidated financial statements include commercial space owned by the company and consolidated entities 
we have a much larger interest in commercial properties through ownership interest in psb 
our investment in psb is accounted for on the equity method of accounting  and accordingly our share of psb s earnings is reflected as equity in earnings of real estate entities  see below 
during  we acquired two commercial facilities which were anticipated to be converted to storage facilities for an aggregate cost of  included within commercial property operations for with respect to these facilities was revenues of  and cost of operations of  included within commercial properties operations for with respect to these facilities were revenues of  and cost of operations of  the following table sets forth the historical commercial property amounts included in the financial statements commercial property operations year ended december  year ended december  change change amounts in thousands rental income     cost of operations     net operating income     depreciation expense     operating income     containerized storage operations in august  public storage pickup delivery pspud  a subsidiary of the company  made its initial entry into the containerized storage business through its acquisition of a single facility operator located in irvine  california 
at december   pspud operated facilities in states 
the facilities are located in major markets in which we have significant market presence with respect to our traditional self storage facilities

rental and other income includes monthly rental charges to customers for storage of the containers and service fees charged for pickup and delivery of containers to customers homes 
rental income increased to  in as compared to  in as a result of higher per container rents and an increase in the number of occupied containers 
rental income increased to  in compared to  in principally as a result in increases in the number of occupied containers 
at december   there were approximately  occupied containers compared to  at december  and  at december  direct operating costs principally includes payroll  equipment lease expense  utilities and vehicle expenses fuel and insurance 
in addition  during and  included in direct operating costs was  and  respectively  expensed due to the obsolescence of containers 
over the past three years  facility lease expense has continued to decrease  in   in and  in 
the reduction over the past two years is principally the result of moving the operations from leased facilities to wholly owned facilities  and thus eliminating the lease expense paid to third parties 
lease expense for was approximately million for those leased facilities that were replaced by wholly owned facilities during accordingly  we expect that facility lease expense will continue to decline during as compared to  as this million will not be incurred in at december   of the containerized storage facilities are leased from third parties 
we anticipate developing three facilities which includes one self storage facility that is being converted to a combination facility that combine self storage and containerized storage space in the same location combination facilities 
these facilities are expected to replace three of the leased facilities during fiscal the company has no plans currently to develop or acquire additional facilities to replace the leased facilities that will remain after completion of our combination facility development program 
the containerized storage operations may continue to adversely impact the company s future earnings and cash flows 
there can be no assurance as to the level of the containerized storage business s expansion  level of gross rentals  level of move outs or profitability 
equity in earnings of real estate entities in addition to our ownership of equity interests in psb  we had general and limited partnership interests in limited partnerships at december  psb and the limited partnerships are collectively referred to as the unconsolidated entities 
due to our limited ownership interest and limited control of these entities  we do not consolidate the accounts of these entities for financial reporting purposes  and account for such investments using the equity method 
equity in earnings of real estate entities for the year ended december  consists of our pro rata share of the unconsolidated entities based upon our ownership interest for the period 
similar to the company  the unconsolidated entities other than psb generate substantially all of their income from their ownership of self storage facilities  which we manage 
as of december   the limited partnerships own a total of self storage facilities  all of which we manage  and psb owns and operates million net rentable square feet of commercial space

during  we also recorded our pro rata share of gain on disposition of real estate investments totaling  this gain is included in the line item gain on disposition of real estate and real estate investments on our consolidated statements of income 
as a result of improved operations of psb and the continued fill up of the self storage facilities owned by the development joint venture  equity in earnings has increased in the years ended december  and as compared to the previous years 
in addition  equity in earnings for the year ended december  includes an increase as compared to the previous year  with respect to certain temporary investments which were acquired in and and disposed of in during and  we acquired controlling interests in certain entities 
as a result of these acquisitions of controlling interests  we began to consolidate the accounts of these entities into our financial statements and no longer account for these investments on the equity method 
equity in earnings of real estate entities includes income of  and  for and  respectively  none for with respect to investments that were no longer held at december  equity in earnings of psb represents our pro rata share approximately at december  of the earnings of ps business parks  inc  a publicly traded real estate investment trust american stock exchange symbol psb organized by the company on january  as of december   we owned  common shares and  operating partnership units units which are convertible into common shares on a one for one basis in psb 
at december   psb owned and operated million net rentable square feet of commercial space located in nine states 
psb also manages the commercial properties owned by the company and affiliated entities 
in april  we formed a joint venture partnership the development joint venture with an institutional investor to participate in the development of approximately million of self storage facilities 
the venture is funded solely with equity capital consisting of from the company and from the institutional investor 
equity in earnings from the development joint venture reflects our pro rata share  based upon our ownership interest  of the operations of the development joint venture 
since inception through december   the development joint venture has developed and opened self storage facilities with an aggregate cost of approximately million 
generally the construction period takes nine to months followed by an estimated month fill up process until the newly constructed facility reaches a stabilized occupancy level of approximately 
for fiscal  and  many of the completed facilities were in the fill up process and had not reached a stabilized occupancy level 
on january   we purchased the interest from the institutional investor for cash totaling approximately  as a result of this purchase  effective january   we will no longer account for our ownership of this entity using the equity method  and accordingly  equity in earnings of real estate investments will be eliminated with respect to this investment on a go forward basis 
correspondingly  effective january   the rental income  cost of operations and depreciation expense with respect to these facilities will be reflected in our consolidated statements of income 
operating results with respect to the other investments includes our pro rata share of earnings with respect to limited partnerships 
these limited partnerships were formed by the company during the s 
the company is the general partner in each limited partnership 
the limited partners consist of numerous individual investors  including the company  which throughout the s acquired units of limited partnership interests in these limited partnerships in various transactions 
these limited partnerships own self storage facilities which are managed by the company under the public storage name 
the operating characteristics of these facilities are similar to those of the company s self storage facilities 
all of these self storage facilities are included in the same store group of facilities see supplemental property data and trends below 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further financial information on these partnerships 
other income and expense items interest and other income interest in other income includes i the net operating results from our third party property management operations  ii the net operating results from our merchandise sales and consumer truck rentals and iii interest income 
interest and other income has decreased in as compared to principally as a result of lower cash balances invested in interest bearing accounts  as well as lower interest rates 
interest and other income has increased in as compared to principally as a result of higher average cash balances invested in interest bearing accounts 
the changes in average cash balances are primarily due to the timing of investing proceeds from the issuance of equity securities into real estate assets 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was  in   in and  in depreciation expense with respect to our real estate facilities was  in   in and  in  the increases are due to the acquisition and development of additional real estate facilities in through depreciation expense with respect to non real estate assets  primarily depreciation of equipment and containers associated with the containerized storage operations  was  in   in and  in amortization expense with respect to intangible assets totaled  for each of the three years ended december  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas and as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  amortization expense with respect to intangible assets is expected to be reduced by  in and beyond as a result of certain provisions of sfas which preclude amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indeterminable lives 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense was  in   in and  in general and administrative costs for each year principally consists of state income taxes  investor relation expenses  certain overhead cost associated with the acquisition and development of real estate facilities  and overhead cost associated with the containerized storage business 
the increase in as compared to is primarily due to increases in our product research and development efforts  costs associated with lease terminations on leased storage facilities used by pspud which were replaced by newly developed facilities  and increased consulting fees 
the total amount of such expenses was approximately  in as compared to  in in addition during  when compared to  we experienced an increase in overhead costs associated with the acquisition and development of real estate facilities amounting to  in  we continued to experience product research and development costs  lease termination expense as well as an increase in employee severance costs which in aggregate totaled  during  when compared to  we experienced an increase in overhead cost associated with the acquisition and development of real estate facilities amounting to  although we expect that our general and administrative expense for fiscal will be less than what we experienced in and  we expect to continue to exceed the level of general and administrative expense experienced in because the company has continued to expand the size and scope of its operations 
interest expense interest expense was  in   in and  in debt and related interest expense remain relatively low compared to our overall asset base 
the decrease in interest expense in and compared to is principally the result of increased capitalized interest  as well as a reduction in average outstanding debt balances 
capitalized interest expense totaled  in   in and  in in connection with our development activities 
the combined interest expense and capitalized interest was  in   in and  in the increase in as compared to is due to the addition of million of notes payable assumed in a merger during  partially offset by regular principal amortization 
we expect that our aggregate interest cost interest expensed and capitalized interest combined during fiscal will continue to decline as a result of principal amortization 
during fiscal  scheduled principal amortization approximates million 
the amount of interest which will be capitalized during fiscal will be dependent on our development activities which we believe will approximate the levels in fiscal minority interest in income minority interest in income represents the income allocable to equity interests in consolidated entities  which are not owned by the company 
the following table summarizes minority interest in income for each of the three years ended december  minority interest in income for the year ended december  december  december  description in thousands preferred partnership interests   consolidated development joint venture  convertible op units  other consolidated partnerships    total minority interests in income    on march   one of our consolidated operating partnerships issued million of series n cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred units

for and  the holders of our preferred partnership units were paid in aggregate approximately  and  respectively  in distributions and received a corresponding allocation of minority interest in earnings for the respective period 
we estimate that during we will pay aggregate distributions totaling million to these units with a corresponding allocation of income to minority interest in earnings 
in november  we formed a development joint venture the consolidated development joint venture with a joint venture partner whose partners include an institutional investor and b

the facilities in the entity are newly developed facilities that are all in the fill up phase 
the increase in minority interest in income in and as compared to the preceding years with respect to the consolidated development joint venture is due to the opening and fill up of the facilities owned by this entity 
we expect that such minority interest in income will continue to increase during as the facilities continue to fill up and increase the earnings of this entity 
we recently mailed an information statement relating to the april  acquisition by the company of all of the remaining limited partnership interest not currently owned by the company in ps partners v  ltd  a partnership which is consolidated with the company 
minority interest in income for the year ended december   with respect to these interests  was approximately million and is included in the other consolidated partnerships category in the table above 
if completed  the transaction would have the effect of reducing minority interest in income on a go forward basis 
see acquisition and development of facilities below 
in determining income allocable to the minority interest for  and consolidated depreciation and amortization expense of approximately   and  respectively  was allocated to the minority interests 
of these amounts    and  respectively  was allocated to the minority interests in the consolidated development joint venture  with the remainder allocated to the minority interests in the other consolidated partnerships and the convertible op units 
supplemental property data and trends at december   there were approximately ownership entities owning in aggregate  storage facilities  including the facilities which we own and or operate 
at december   of these facilities were owned by unconsolidated entities  entities in which we have an ownership interest and use the equity method for financial statement presentation 
the remaining  facilities are owned by the company and consolidated entities 
the following table summarizes our investment in real estate facilities as of december  net rentable square number of footage of storage storage facilities facilities in thousands consolidated facilities wholly owned by the company  owned by consolidated entities  facilities owned by unconsolidated entities institutional partnerships development joint venture a  other  total facilities in which the company has an ownership interest   a in january  we acquired the remaining interest in this partnership in which we previously owned only a interest for an aggregate of in addition to the company s interest in storage facilities noted above  the company and the consolidated entities own five commercial facilities with an aggregate of  net rentable square feet 
we also have a common interest in psb  which owns and operates million net rentable square feet of commercial space 
in order to evaluate how our overall self storage portfolio has performed  as management we analyze the operating performance of a consistent group of storage facilities representing million net rentable square feet of the  storage facilities herein referred to as same store storage facilities 
the facilities represent a consistent pool of properties which have been operated under the public storage name  at a stabilized level  by the company since january  from time to time  we remove facilities from the same store pool as a result of expansions  dispositions or other activities which make such facilities results not comparable to previous periods 
the same store group of properties includes facilities that are not consolidated in the financial statements 
accordingly  rental income and cost of operations with respect to these facilities are not reflected on the consolidated statements of income 
as of december   the remaining facilities are included in the consolidated financial statements  however  many of them were not included in the consolidated financial statements throughout each of the three years presented

cost of operations consists of the following payroll expense    property taxes    repairs and maintenance    advertising    telephone reservation center costs    utilities    management  office  insurance  and other expenses    gross profit margin is computed by dividing property net operating income before depreciation expense by rental revenues 
realized annual rent per square foot is computed by annualizing rental income excluding late charges and administrative fees divided by weighted average occupied square footage for the year 
as indicated above  the same store facilities net operating income increased in as compared to and in as compared to rental income increased in as compared to and in as compared to cost of operations increased in as compared to and in as compared to we do not expect to maintain this level of growth in either as to net operating income or rental income 
the increase in rental income for as compared to is attributable to a increase in realized rent per occupied square foot partially offset by a reduction in weighted average occupancy levels during the period 
higher realized rent per occupied square foot was achieved through more aggressive pricing of our self storage space  partially offset by a reduction in occupancy levels 
during  we increased rents charged to new tenants and significantly reduced the level of discounts offered to new tenants 
promotional discounts totaled approximately million in  million in and in in addition  during  we increased the level of rent charged to our existing tenant base in many markets 
we believe that our ability to raise rents and reduce promotional discounts and thereby increase rental income during was facilitated by more aggressive marketing efforts  including an increase in television advertising expenditures for of million as compared to  as well as an increase in the intensity of our yellow page advertising  and the continuing impact of our efforts over the last several years to improve the value of the public storage brand  most significantly through the completion of our program to enhance our visual icon and to modernize the appearance of our self storage facilities 
we believe that principally as a result of our more aggressive rental rates and reductions in the amount of promotional discounts  and partially as a result of the national economic contraction discussed below  our weighted average occupancy levels decreased during as compared to our occupancy levels through the first two months of fiscal continued to trend downward  with the same store facilities average occupancy level at at february  as compared to at february  while the occupancy level at february  is significantly lower than the average occupancy levels experienced during the year  some decreases in occupancy are expected due to minor seasonal fluctuations in occupancies 
occupancies are generally higher in the summer months than in the winter months 
we therefore believe that the comparison of occupancies at february  versus that at february  provides a more meaningful measure of occupancy trends 
we believe that the national economic contraction has also contributed to our decreasing occupancies  however  it is difficult to isolate the impact of the downturn from our aforementioned pricing decisions 
while there can be no assurance  we believe that the potential impact of regional downturns are partially mitigated by the geographic diversification and quality locations of our facilities 
our storage facilities are geographically diversified and are located primarily in or near major metropolitan markets in states 
we are continuously evaluating our call volume  reservation activity  and move in move out rates for each of our markets relative to our marketing activities and rental rates 
in addition  we are evaluating market supply and demand factors and based upon these analyses we are continuing to adjust our marketing activities  and are currently reducing rental rates charged to new incoming tenants in an effort to increase our occupancy levels

number of facilities liquidity and capital resources we believe that our internally generated net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to meet our operating expenses  capital improvements  debt service requirements and distributions to shareholders for the foreseeable future 
operating as a real estate investment trust reit  our ability to retain cash flow for reinvestment is restricted 
in order for us to maintain our reit status  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow must be used to make distributions to our shareholders see requirement to pay distributions below 
however  despite the significant distribution requirements  we have been able to retain a significant amount of our operating cash flow 
the following table summarizes our ability to fund distributions to the minority interest  capital improvements to maintain our facilities  and distributions to our shareholders through the use of cash provided by operating activities 
the remaining cash flow generated is available to make both scheduled and optional principal payments on debt and for reinvestment 
for the year ended december  amount in thousands net cash provided by operating activities    allocable to minority interests preferred units   allocable to minority interests common equity    cash from operations allocable to our shareholders    capital improvements to maintain our facilities storage facilities    commercial properties  add back minority interest share of capital improvements to maintain facilities   remaining operating cash flow available for distributions to our shareholders    distributions paid preferred stock dividends    equity stock  series a dividends   regular distributions to common and class b shareholders    special distributions to common and class b shareholders a    cash available for principal payments on debt and reinvestment    a the special distribution for was declared in august and paid in september the special distribution for was declared in august and paid in september the special distribution for was declared in and paid in january in each instance  the special distribution enabled the company to maintain its reit status with respect to the distribution requirements 
our financial profile is characterized by a low level of debt to total capitalization  increasing net income  increasing cash flow from operations  and a conservative dividend payout ratio with respect to the common stock 
we expect to fund our growth strategies with cash on hand at december   internally generated retained cash flows  and proceeds from issuing equity securities 
in general  our current strategy is to continue to finance our growth with permanent capital  either common or preferred equity 
we have in the past used our million line of credit as temporary bridge financing  and repaid those amounts with internally generated cash flows and proceeds from the placement of permanent capital 
as of december   outstanding borrowings under our million bank line of credit totaled million 
in addition  outstanding debt at december  totaled million  consisting of mortgage debt of million and unsecured debt of million 
by comparison  our real estate facilities had a net book value of approximately billion at december  accordingly  our portfolio of real estate facilities is substantially unencumbered 
over the past three years we have funded substantially all of our acquisitions with permanent capital both common and preferred securities 
we have elected to use preferred securities as a form of leverage despite the fact that the dividend rates of our preferred securities exceed the prevailing market interest rates on conventional debt 
we have chosen this method of financing for the following reasons i under the reit structure  a significant amount of operating cash flow needs to be distributed to our shareholders making it difficult to repay debt with operating cash flow alone  ii our perpetual preferred stock has no sinking fund requirement  or maturity date and does not require redemption  all of which eliminate any future refinancing risks  iii after the end of a non call period  we have the option to redeem the preferred stock at any time  which in enabled us to effectively refinance higher coupon preferred stock with new preferred stock at lower rates  iv preferred stock does not contain onerous covenants  thus allowing us to maintain significant financial flexibility  and v dividends on the preferred stock can be applied to our reit distribution requirements 
our credit ratings on each of our series of cumulative preferred stock by each of the three major credit agencies are baa by moody s and bbb by both standard poor s and fitch ibca 
we believe that our size and financial flexibility enables us to access capital when appropriate 
during  we completed the following capital raising activities amounts are presented net of issuance costs cumulative equity preferred stock  securities issued date issued stock series a in thousands cumulative preferred stock  series q january   public issuance of equity stock  series a april   direct placement of equity stock  series a may   cumulative preferred stock  series r september   cumulative preferred stock  series s october   direct placement of equity stock  series a november   the net proceeds raised through the issuance of our cumulative preferred stock  series r and series s allowed us to take advantage of favorable rate spreads 
accordingly  at our option  we redeemed for cash our cumulative preferred stock series g  series h and series i  each having higher coupon rates than either the series r or series s 
in addition  we repurchased all of our outstanding series p partnership preferred units and a portion of our outstanding series o partnership preferred units 
these transactions  summarized below  represented a refinancing of a portion of our permanent capital structure into lower coupon securities 
cumulative preferred date redeemed or preferred partnership security redeemed or repurchased repurchased stock units in thousands cumulative preferred units  series o august   cumulative preferred stock  series g september   cumulative preferred stock  series h october   cumulative preferred units  series p october   cumulative preferred stock  series i november   the cumulative preferred stock amounts listed above include redemption cost of approximately  per redemption 
subsequent to december   we issued additional cumulative preferred stock million of our cumulative preferred stock  series t was issued on january  and million of our cumulative preferred stock  series u was issued on february  it is our intent to call for redemption our senior preferred stock series a  which becomes redeemable on september  the aggregate redemption amount for this security is per share or approximately million  plus accrued dividends 
requirement to pay distributions we have operated  and intend to continue to operate  in such a manner as to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of  but no assurance can be given that we will at all times so qualify 
to the extent that the company continues to qualify as a reit  we will not be taxed  with certain limited exceptions  on the taxable income that is distributed to our shareholders  provided that at least of our taxable income is so distributed to our shareholders prior to filing of the company s tax return 
we have satisfied the reit distribution requirement since during  we paid regular quarterly distributions of per common share for the first two quarters  during the third and fourth quarters the regular quarterly distribution was per common share 
in addition  in the third quarter  a special distribution in the amount of per common share an aggregate of million was declared and paid 
aggregate dividends paid during  totaled million to the holders of our cumulative preferred stock  million to the holders of our common stock  million to the holders of our class b common stock and million to the holders of our equity stock  series a 
although we have not finalized the calculation of our taxable income  we believe that the aggregate dividends paid in to our shareholders were designed to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit 
we estimate that the distribution requirements for fiscal with respect to our cumulative preferred stock outstanding including the series t and u issued subsequent to december   and assuming the redemption of cumulative preferred stock  series a  will be approximately million 
during  we paid distributions totaling million with respect to our preferred partnership units 
we estimate the annual distributions requirements with respect to the preferred partnership units outstanding at december  to be approximately million 
for  distributions with respect to the common stock and equity stock  series a will be determined based upon our reit distribution requirements after taking into consideration distributions to the preferred shareholders 
we anticipate that  at a minimum  quarterly distributions per common share will remain at per common share increased from per common share during and in the first two quarters of 
for the first quarter of  a quarterly distribution of per common share has been declared by our board of directors 
over the past several years  in addition to the regular quarterly dividends paid to our common shareholder  we also paid special distributions 
these special distributions were necessary to meet our distribution requirements in order to maintain our reit tax status 
the need to make a special distribution in is not determinable at this time and will depend in large part on our taxable income relative to the distributions being paid to all of our shareholders 
with respect to the depositary shares of equity stock  series a  we have no obligation to pay distributions if no distributions are paid to the common shareholders 
to the extent that we do pay common distributions in any year  the holders of the depositary shares receive annual distributions equal to the lesser of i five times the per share dividend on the common stock or ii 
the depositary shares are noncumulative  and have no preference over our common stock either as to dividends or in liquidation 
capital improvement requirements during  we have budgeted approximately million for capital improvements 
capital improvements include major repairs or replacements to the facilities which keep the facilities in good operation condition and maintain their visual appeal 
capital improvements do not include costs relating to the development or expansion of facilities 
debt service requirements we do not believe we have any significant refinancing risks with respect to our mortgage debt  all of which is fixed rate 
at december   we had total outstanding notes payable of approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for approximate principal maturities of such borrowings 
we anticipate that our retained operating cash flow will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make scheduled principal payments 
it is our current intent to fully amortize our debt as opposed to refinance debt maturities with additional debt 
growth strategies during  we intend to continue to expand our asset and capital base through the acquisition of real estate assets and interests in real estate assets through direct purchases  mergers  tender offers or other transactions and through the development of additional storage facilities 
acquisition and development of facilities during  we acquired only one self storage facility for approximately million 
during  we acquired two commercial facilities and storage facilities at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
our low level of third party acquisitions over the past two years is not indicative of either the supply of facilities offered for sale or our ability to finance the acquisitions  but is primarily due to prices sought by sellers and our lack of desire to pay such prices 
during fiscal  we will continue to seek to acquire additional self storage facilities from third parties  however  it is difficult to estimate the level of third party acquisitions 
on september   we acquired the remaining ownership interests in an affiliated partnership  of which we were the general partner  for an aggregate acquisition cost of million 
this partnership owned self storage facilities 
in april  we formed a joint venture partnership with an institutional investor for the purpose of developing up to million of self storage facilities 
the joint venture is funded solely with equity capital consisting of from us and from the institutional investor 
our share of the cost of the real estate in the joint venture was approximately million at december  as of december   the joint venture had operating facilities  with  net rentable square feet and total development costs of approximately million 
on january   we acquired the interest from the institutional investor for approximately  in cash 
this transaction was principally financed with the capital raised through the issuance of our cumulative preferred stock  series t 
we recently mailed an information statement relating to the april  acquisition by the company of all of the  limited partnership units that it did not own in ps partners v  ltd  a partnership which is consolidated with the company 
the acquisition of the  units will be accomplished through a merger of a subsidiary of the company into the partnership and the conversion of the  units into either cash or common stock of the company 
each unit will be converted into the right to receive a value of in our common stock or  cash at the election of the unitholder 
we expect that the cash portion of the transaction will be funded by available cash on hand 
in november  we formed a second joint venture partnership for the development of approximately million of self storage facilities 
the venture is funded solely with equity capital consisting of from us and from the joint venture partner 
the term of the joint venture is years 
after six years  the joint venture partner has the right to cause the company to purchase the joint venture partner s interest for an amount necessary to provide them with a maximum return of or less in certain circumstances 
at december   this development joint venture was committed to develop facilities approximately  net rentable sq 
ft  of which facilities approximately  net rentable sq 
ft 
were completed at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
as of december   this development joint venture is developing two additional projects approximately  net rentable square feet that were in process  with total costs incurred of million and estimated remaining costs to complete of  we currently have a development pipeline of self storage facilities  combination facilities  and expansions to existing self storage facilities with an aggregate estimated cost of approximately million 
approximately million of development cost has been incurred as of december  we have acquired the land for of these projects  which have an aggregate estimated cost of approximately million  and costs incurred as of december  of approximately million 
the remaining facilities represent identified sites where we have an agreement in place to acquire the land  generally within one year 
we anticipate that the development of these projects will be funded solely by the company 
the development and fill up of these storage facilities is subject to significant contingencies such as obtaining appropriate governmental approvals 
we estimate that the amount remaining to be spent of approximately million will be incurred over the next months

during  we repurchased a total of  common shares  for a total aggregate cost of approximately million 
from the inception of the repurchase program through december   we have repurchased a total of  shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
from january  until march   there were no significant repurchases of our common stock 
funds from operations total funds from operations ffo increased to million for the year ended compared to million for the year ended and million in ffo available to common shareholders after deducting preferred stock dividends increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in and million in ffo means net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles before i gain loss on early extinguishment of debt  ii minority interest in income and iii gain loss on disposition of real estate  adjusted as follows i plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate assets including the company s pro rata share of depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated equity interests and amortization of assets acquired in a merger  including property management agreements and goodwill  and ii less ffo attributable to minority interests 
ffo is a supplemental performance measure for equity reits as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit 
the nareit definition does not specifically address the treatment of minority interest in the determination of ffo or the treatment of the amortization of property management agreements and goodwill 
in the case of the company  ffo represents amounts attributable to its shareholders after deducting amounts attributable to the minority interests and before deductions for the amortization of property management agreements and goodwill 
ffo is presented because management  as well as many industry analysts  consider ffo to be one measure of the performance of the company and it is used in establishing the terms of the class b common stock 
ffo does not take into consideration capital improvements  scheduled principal payments on debt  distributions and other obligations of the company 
accordingly  ffo is not a substitute for the company s cash flow or net income as discussed above as a measure of the company s liquidity or operating performance 
ffo is not comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other reits that do not define it exactly as we have defined it
