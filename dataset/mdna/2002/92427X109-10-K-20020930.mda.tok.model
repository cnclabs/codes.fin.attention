contingencies on october   the company entered into a ten year lease for  square feet on madison avenue in new york city 
on december   the company s madison avenue location was closed due to structural problems at neighboring madison avenue 
on december  the company announced that it was permanently closing that retail location 
the city of new york deemed the madison avenue building uninhabitable from december  to april   and the company has not made any rent payments on the lease since december  on december   the company received a notice from its landlord of madison avenue alleging that it was in default under the lease for failure to resume occupancy  and demand for back rent for the period july  to december  in the amount of  further on january  the company received a demand to resume rent payments beginning january the company disputed the landlord s position and believed it was not obliga ted to resume occupancy or pay rent under the lease 
as a result  on may   the company commenced action in the supreme court of the state of new york  county of new york against madison realty company 
the action sought breach of contract damages and a declaration that the contract at issue  the former lease between the parties  has been terminated 
the landlord moved to dismiss the action based on purported documentary evidence  being the lease itself 
that motion was denied by order entered april  after having unsuccessfully attempted to resolve the disputes and after engaging in document discovery  the company moved for summary judgement on its claims and dismissal of the landlord s claims 
that motion was granted by order dated july  and judgement was entered in favor of the company and against the landlord in the amount of  on august  the landlord filed an appeal of that judgement and  as settlement discussions have been unsuccessful  has posted a bon d to stay enforcement of the judgement pending its appeal  which will be argued in october of the company has accrued management s estimated cost of  to settle this contingency  but no assurance can be given that this dispute can be settled for this amount 
in the event that no settlement is reached and the judgement is ultimately reversed on appeal and the company is not successful in its suit against madison realty company  the remaining amount owed under the lease over its remaining term at face value is  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their impact cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgement 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
we believe application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies  which are described below inventory valuation the company carries its inventory at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis 
the company makes certain assumptions to adjust inventory based on historical experience and current information in order to assess that inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or market 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
these adjustments can have a significant impact on current and future operating results and financial position 
providing for litigation contingencies as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is involved in litigation incidental to its business  the disposition of which is expected to have no material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by differences between the company s assumptions related to these proceedings and actual results 
the company accrues its best estimate of the probable cost for the resolution of legal claims 
such estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling these matters and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
to the extent additional information arises  it is possible that the company s best estimate of its probable liability in these matters may change 
returns and allowances provision the company accrues a provision for returns and allowances 
the company makes certain assumptions to adjust this provision based on historical experience and current information in order to assess that the provision is estimated properly 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional adjustments to the provision may be required 
these adjustments can have a significant impact on current and future operating results and financial position 
income tax provision the company provides for income taxes at rates equal to our combined federal and state effective rates  however  certain estimates are made based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of deferred tax assets  deferred tax liabilities and other income tax liabilities could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from its investment of available cash balances in money market funds 
under its current policies  the company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a ten percent fluctuation in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s ability to meet its financial obligations
