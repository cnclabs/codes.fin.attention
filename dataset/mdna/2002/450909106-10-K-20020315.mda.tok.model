item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of ibis including notes thereto and selected financial data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview ibis technology corporation ibis was formed in october and commenced operations in january ibis initial activities consisted of producing and selling simox soi wafers and conducting research and development activities 
this research led to the development of a proprietary second generation implanter  the ibis  which we began selling in  and to other proprietary process technology 
initially  much of our revenue was derived from research and development contracts and sales of wafers for military applications 
over the years  there was a shift in revenue to sales of simox soi wafers for commercial applications and the nature of our business has evolved through stages where sometimes our revenues primarily resulted from selling wafers for evaluation purposes  and sometimes our revenue was generated primarily from equipment sales 
this is a normal path to follow while developing and promoting a fundamental new technology  especially when it relates to the semiconductor industry embracing any change that affects fabrication operations this trend is expected to continue in the near term as our customers continue to sample soi and the early adopters work to achieve stable production processes and enter pilot production 
we believe that we are in the technology rollout stage of our corporate life cycle 
our fundamental simox soi technology has been developed  refined  and proven over the last dozen years 
ibis is at a point of introducing the next generation production worthy simox soi  which includes both the recently licensed modified low dose mld wafer process and the i  our next generation oxygen implanter  which is capable of producing eight and twelve inch or and mm simox soi wafers 
in  we commenced a program to design and develop the i and in january  we successfully performed the first implants using the i the final steps in the development of the i are expected to be completed during the first half of commercial shipments of our wafers have been used principally for evaluation purposes or pilot production in products  including microprocessors  gate arrays  asics application specific integrated circuits  memories drams  srams  etc  and cellular and mobile radio components 
from our customers perspective  the pathway to soi adoption is complex and time consuming 
typically  a customer will go through three major stages sampling  where preliminary performance characteristics are explored and verified  r d  where specific customer specifications are tested and developed  and production  where yield and cost benefits are optimized 
each of these stages has many steps  and customers must evaluate each new wafer technology that essentially lays a new foundation for substantially all other processes they have spent billions of dollars and decades of time developing 
accordingly  it takes anywhere from to months for a customer to proceed from initial sampling through r d to initial production  which is not unlike the standard process for qualifying any new wafer material 
these steps apply each time there is a change in the customer s fabrication process  such as a feature size change or new material 
to date  most of our customers have purchased wafers for the purpose of characterizing and evaluating the wafers  developing prototype products or for pilot production  consequently historical sales are not necessarily an indication of future operations 
as a result  inventory valuation is a critical accounting policy for ibis 
our policy is to value our wafers at market when costs exceed market and to reserve for a possible over supply of wafers utilizing inventory aging records and for obsolescence when engineering changes or other technological advances indicate that obsolescence has occurred 
ibis has experienced quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenue and results of operations due to the timing of receipt of equipment orders and dependence on a limited number of customers 
we expect to continue to experience fluctuations in revenue due to equipment sales and shifts in customer demands during various stages of the simox soi sales cycle 
we recognize implanter revenue in accordance with sab  which includes among other criteria  the shipment and factory installation of the implanter at the customer s location 
as a result  deferral of revenue may extend longer due to meeting this criteria 
at december   ibis had nine ibis implanters available to produce up to mm simox wafers  two of which are owned by a customer 
relative to products produced  the utilization rate for those nine implanters during the fourth quarter of was approximately 
one more ibis implanter will become available to produce wafers in the first quarter of and an additional one is dedicated as a research and development tool 
ibis anticipates that one i implanter will be available to produce mm simox wafers in the second half of and we plan to build at least one more i in although  the implanters are currently underutilized  management has performed an analysis of impairment  which indicates that there is not an impairment issue with our implanters 
the factors we considered are as follows management of ibis currently believes that our anticipated scale of operations assumes a modest increase in wafer sales in the first half over the run rate in the fourth quarter of and indications suggest that our advantox mld wafers will be qualified at one of our largest customers  which we believe could lead to increased wafer sales in the second half of  soi is a new technology which is just starting to be adopted by major semiconductor players  ibis is at a point of introducing the next generation production worthy simox soi  which includes both the recently licensed modified low dose mld wafer process and the i  our next generation oxygen implanter  which is capable of producing eight and twelve inch or and mm simox soi wafers  and we recently sold an ibis implanter to a customer in china and have potential for additional sales of used ibis implanters to this customer and others in the future 
we will continue to review our assumptions about our long lived assets on a periodic basis for potential impairment in future quarters 
we cannot be sure that our implanters or other long lived assets will not become impaired in the future 
in addition  the impairment factors evaluated by management may change in subsequent periods  given the current trends of the business environment 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  product sales 
wafer product sales decreased to  for the fiscal year ended december   a decrease of  or from  for the fiscal year ended december  the decrease in product sales is attributable to decreased wafer sales by ibis in europe  as the impact of the order cutback announced in mid april from one of our largest wafer customers that is in the optical components arena  was realized 
in the pacific rim wafer sales increased overall during this twelve month period 
sales by ibis in the united states also increased overall during this twelve month period  even though our largest domestic customer delayed further simox soi wafer purchases during their qualification of our advantox mld process 
in december  ibis entered into a royalty bearing license agreement with this customer which gives ibis the right to manufacture and sell simox soi wafers using the licensed process 
ibis began shipping sample quantities of this material in may contract and other revenue

other income 
total other income for the fiscal year ending december  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ending december  the increase in total other income of  or is attributable to increased interest income earned on the cash balance and reduced interest expense on capitalized leases 
as of december   the company had federal net operating loss and general business credit carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively  for tax purposes expiring through as a result of the public stock offering that closed in april of  shares at per share  a change of ownership within the meaning of sec 
g of the internal revenue code occurred 
as a result of this ownership change  the net operating loss carryforward utilization is limited to approximately  per year  which limitation  if not utilized  can be carried forward to future years 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   ibis had cash and cash equivalents of  reflecting in large part our receipt of approximately million in net proceeds from the august public sale of  shares of common stock 
during the fiscal year ended december   ibis used  in cash from operating activities as compared to cash generated by operations in the amount of  in depreciation and amortization expense for the fiscal years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
this accounted for and of total revenue  respectively 
due to the capital intensive nature of ibis business and the recent expansion of our facilities and production capacity  management expects that depreciation and amortization will continue to be a significant portion of its expenses 
to date  ibis working capital requirements have been funded primarily through debt and equity financings 
the principal uses of cash during the fiscal year ended december  were to fund operations and additions to property and equipment which totaled  at december   ibis had commitments to purchase approximately  in material to be used for wafer manufacturing  spare parts on the ibis implanters and for manufacturing an additional i implanter  and approximately  in capital equipment purchases 
on august   ibis completed the public offering of  shares of common stock in an offering underwritten by soundview technology group 
the shares were included in a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on july  and declared effective on july  net proceeds from the offering were approximately million and have been used and will continue to be used to fund research and development  capital expenditures  working capital and for other general corporate purposes 
in september  ibis entered into a million equipment lease line with heller financial s commercial equipment finance group 
the lease line was used to finance the purchase of process equipment for wafer production  primarily mm wafers 
this line was fully drawn down in two sale leaseback transactions  bearing interest at approximately with a term of three years  and a monthly net payment of approximately  ibis has a fair market value purchase option at the end of the lease term 
the lease line is secured by the underlying assets and all other property and equipment of ibis 
our existing cash resources are believed to be sufficient to support ibis operations on our anticipated scale for at least the next twelve months 
our anticipated scale of operations assumes a modest increase in wafer sales in the first half over the run rate in the fourth quarter of and indications suggest that our advantox mld wafers will be qualified at one of our largest customers  which we believe could lead to increased wafer sales in the second half of our plans also include the purchase of production support equipment and facility improvements and the build of at least one more i oxygen implanter 
we continue to explore equity offerings and other forms of financing and anticipate that we may be required to raise additional capital in the future in order to finance the expansion of our manufacturing capacity and our research and development programs 
should dispositive results occur in the qualification of our mld wafers or our new i implanter  we will be required to curtail capital outlays and other discretionary spending and possibly accelerate longer term investments in ibis 
effects of inflation ibis believes that over the past three years inflation has not had a significant impact on our sales or operating results
