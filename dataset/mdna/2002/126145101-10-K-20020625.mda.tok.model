the products of each segment are manufactured and marketed both in the us and in other parts of the world 
sales between segments are not material 
net sales and net income the company s net sales decreased in  as compared to  and in  as compared to for the fuller brands segment  net sales decreased over this was primarily due to the decrease in cleaning technologies group sales of almost  due to the effects of the september  terrorist attacks  and the reduction in k mart business 
stanley home products slight sales decreases were offset by sales increases in the traditional fuller brush business 
in  the fuller brush segment sales were lower than  due to sales declines in all three operating divisions 
for the imaging segment  sales in decreased over  caused by sales decreases in the segment s domestic photochemical  medical imaging  and equipment manufacturing operations  mitigated by combined sales increases in the segment s international operations 
the company s domestic operations continued to be impacted by the fierce competition in the north american market  as well as the business slowdown experienced  as a result of the us recession  and september  terrorist attacks 
sales in decreased over this was largely attributable to decreases in the imaging segment s domestic medical imaging and photochemical sales  as well as the impact of currency translations on the foreign operation s reported revenues  which caused net sales to be reduced by approximately million 
net income in decreased over  as both segment profits declined 
in the fuller brands segment  stanley home products and cleaning technologies group operations had sharp declines in profits  due to sales shortfalls outlined above  as well as continued investments in sales and marketing programs intended to stimulate business once the us economy rebounds 
the traditional fuller brush business helped to mitigate this decline with strong earnings from their contract consumer and catalogue internet business 
the imaging segment s profits declined as all operations with the exception of the segment s asian operations had profit declines  led by its north american photochemical operation 
net income in decreased from  due to reductions in revenues from both segments that accelerated in the third and fourth quarters 
in the fuller brands segment  lower sales volume coupled with fixed operating expenses and continuation of sales stimulation programs caused operating income to decline as compared to in the imaging segment  reductions in operating income of the domestic operations were partially offset by positive foreign operation s earnings  leading to a net decline in operating income of 
in addition  foreign currency negatively impacted imaging results by approximately  corporate overhead expense not allocated to the two segments declined in over  due to a reduction in overall spending  resulting from the economic slowdown being experienced 
foreign operations combined net sales of the company s foreign operations in belgium  italy  south africa  and thailand rose approximately  in over this was primarily due to cpac asia whose net sales increased  over levels 
the sales increases at cpac asia were offset by sales declines at its belgian  italian  and south african operations where currency declines against the us dollar impacted their translated results 
pretax profits for the four combined entities declined almost  due to currency pressures in italy and south africa  as well as continued investment in sales and marketing initiatives to attempt to maintain or increase revenues 
combined net sales of the company s foreign operations in belgium  italy  south africa  and thailand rose in over this was primarily attributable to cpac asia  which had a full year of sales and manufacturing in  versus only three months of actual shipments in fiscal combined net sales of the other three foreign operations rose less than 
pretax profits for the combined grouped increased by approximately  to approximately  this was led by cpac asia which was profitable in versus a start up loss in  and cpac europe whose profits were up over  both net sales and pretax income were impacted by the strong us dollar and high currency translation rates 
management estimates that currency movements unfavorably impacted combined net sales and pretax profits by approximately  and  respectively 
the company has exposure to currency fluctuations and occasionally has utilized hedging programs primarily forward foreign currency exchange contracts to help minimize the impact of these fluctuations on results of operations 
at march  no forward foreign currency exchange contracts were outstanding 
the company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivative transactions 
on a consolidated basis  foreign currency exchange losses are included in income or expense as incurred and are not material to the results of operations 
gross margins gross margins net sales less cost of sales expressed as a percentage of net sales  were   and for the years ended march    and  respectively 
gross margins in the fuller brands segment increased in to  as compared to and in and  respectively 
however  as a result of lower sales volumes  gross profit margins in the fourth quarter of declined to and are expected to remain closer to that level for the early part of fiscal  depending on product mix sold 
in addition  the increase or decrease of the segment s manufacturing throughput in its great bend  kansas  facility will also have a significant impact on blended gross margins 
gross margins in the imaging segment increased to in  versus and in and  respectively 
strong margin improvement of several of the foreign operations helped increase the percentages in in an effort to gain additional market share  it is anticipated that margins may retreat slightly to the to range during early fiscal selling  administration and engineering expenses this category amounted to   and of net sales in fiscal years   and  respectively 
in  the fuller brands segment s selling  administration and engineering expenses were of net sales  as compared to in and in  respectively 
a portion of the increase was a direct result of lower revenues  coupled with increased marketing and promotional expenses in the segment s stanley home products to increase its direct selling business 
it is anticipated that as the segment s revenues begin to increase to previous year s levels  that the individual business units will not have to substantially increase selling expenses  thus reducing selling  administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales from its levels 
in  the imaging segment s selling  administration and engineering expenses as a percentage of sales were versus and in and  respectively 
the increase was largely caused by the continued decline in sales through the third and fourth quarters  without a corresponding reduction in spending 
employment levels  selling  and marketing programs were not reduced during this time period in hope of gaining additional business  when the economic conditions improve 
in addition  the segment s asian operation increased expenditures in the japanese market  as export opportunities in that country continued to expand

r d efforts in the imaging segment in will continue to be focused on improving the existing chemical products being sold domestically and internationally 
total research and development expense  as a percentage of net sales  is not expected to change dramatically in from current levels 
interest expense the decline in net interest expense in versus was caused by a combination of lower interest rates and debt reduction in while interest income declined slightly in  a strong cash position maintained through the first nine months of helped to offset lower investment rates for most of the year 
the increase in net interest expense in versus  is primarily a reflection of higher interest incurred on borrowings related to cpac asia imaging products limited 
income taxes the provision for income taxes  as a percentage of pretax income  was in  as compared to and in and  respectively 
in and  the effective tax rate reflected the benefit of the seven year tax holiday existing for the company s asian subsidiary  as well as lower domestic state taxes 
since the company continues to receive the tax holiday through  it is anticipated that the company s effective rate will continue to range from to during liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations and acquisitions with internally generated cash flows  supplemented with outside borrowings

the following tables represent various ratios the company uses to measure liquidity 
working capital ratios working capital is the excess of current assets over current liabilities 
the working capital ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities 
for the years ended march  working capital in thousands working capital ratio to to to during fiscal  despite the shortfall in sales and profits  the company s fuller brands segment continued to provide positive cash flow  allowing the consolidated company to continue its stock repurchase programs  acquire capital assets where needed  and fund the imaging segment s investment in tura ag 
during fiscal  reductions in capital spending million and reductions in stock repurchases million  helped to offset lower earnings million and contributed to increased working capital and an improvement in the working capital ratio 
during fiscal  lower revenues and operating earnings contributed to the decrease in the company s working capital levels 
increased net borrowings million  primarily to support the construction and start up activities of cpac asia  as well as cash utilized for the stock buy back program million and capital additions million  also lowered working capital levels 
however  cash generated from operations million was extremely strong  due to reduction in inventory levels  improvement in accounts receivable collection efforts  and other operating efficiencies experienced

the company s majority owned subsidiary cpac asia imaging products limited has a line of credit with an international bank of  million baht approximately  based on the year end conversion rate in thailand 
interest is payable at prime prime rate in thailand was at march   with the line collateralized by a standby letter of credit loc guaranteed by cpac  inc cpac asia imaging products limited had borrowings against the line of credit of  at march  management believes that its existing available lines of credit and cash flows from operations should be adequate to meet normal working capital needs  based on operations as of march  it is expected that additional financing may be necessary to allow the company to pursue additional acquisitions 
asset turnover ratios for the years ended march  receivables days outstanding days days days annual inventory turns times times times receivable days outstanding remained fairly consistent in  as compared to  despite the decline in sales 
receivable days outstanding improved in  as compared to  due primarily to continued improvement in fuller brands collection efforts  as well as a reduction of credit promotional programs associated with the stanley direct selling operation 
inventory turns decreased slightly in  as compared to and  due to an increase in inventory levels over the last three to six months of fiscal  when sales did not increase as expected 
profitability ratios operating return on net sales is the result of dividing operating income by net sales 
net income on net sales is calculated by dividing net income by net sales

for the years ended march  operating return on net sales net income on net sales net income to net worth the decrease in operating return on net sales  net income on net sales  and net income to net worth in  as compared to  is a result of the reduction in sales and earnings in both the fuller brands and imaging segments 
in addition  despite the significant impact of the september  terrorist attacks and the increasing effect of the continued us recession  the company made a deliberate effort to maintain selling and marketing efforts  so as to poise itself for eventual sales increases  once these factors mitigate  expected in late fiscal the decrease in net income to net worth in was partially offset by the continuation of dividend payouts at historical levels  as well as continuation of the company s stock buy back initiatives 
the decrease in operating return on net sales  net income on net sales  and net income to net worth in  as compared to  is a result of the revenue and earnings shortfall experienced in the third and fourth quarter  due to the economic slowdown experienced by the company s domestic operations 
leverage ratios debt to debt plus equity is calculated by dividing all liabilities by the sum of all liabilities plus shareholders equity 
total debt to equity is calculated by dividing all liabilities by the amount of shareholders equity 
these ratios measure the extent to which the company has been financed by debt and are an important measure to our lending institutions 
for the years ended march  debt to debt plus equity total debt to equity to to to the ratios remained relatively consistent in as compared to  with continued debt paydown improving the debt to equity ratio 
the decrease in both ratios in  as compared to  reflects continued paydown of debt obligations  supplemented by decreased stock repurchases  as compared to contractual cash obligations amounts in thousands the following tables summarizes information about the company s consolidated contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments in thousands  as of march   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its consolidated liquidity and cash flow in future periods cpac  inc consolidated payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years after years long term debt operating leases other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period total less than year to years to years after years unused credit facilities standby letters of credit total commercial commitments as of march   the company had no borrowings against its million line of credit with its primary domestic lending institution 
as of march   the company s majority owned subsidiary cpac asia imaging products limited had borrowed approximately  against its  line of credit  leaving  of available borrowing capacity 
the company believes that these liabilities have no material impact on cpac  inc s liquidity and capital resources 
as of the date of the report  cpac  inc had no other commercial commitments  which may impact its capital resources and liquidity 
in the absence of unforeseen developments  cpac  inc believes that it has sufficient liquidity to fund its operating expenses and other operational requirements at least for the months following the date of this report 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the estimates that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are described below 
the critical judgments impacting the financial statements include the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  and accounts receivable and inventory reserve determinations and net realizability estimates 
in each situation  management is required to make estimates about the effects of matters  or future events that are inherently uncertain 
specifically  in its assessment of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  management made estimates of the fair values based upon forecasted revenues and operations 
an assessment of accounts receivable and inventory realizability requires management to forecast sales and future market conditions and technological developments 
the company used what it believes are reasonable assumptions and where applicable  established valuation techniques in making its estimates 
impact of inflation due to continued competitive sales pressures in both of the company s segments  the company has generally not been able to pass on all inflation related cost increases in its imaging segment or in its fuller brands commercial cleaning operation 
the company is hoping to minimize the impact of inflationary pressures through increased productivity and cost reduction efforts with its various vendors 
environmental contingency remediation efforts that related to the fiscal acquisition of the fuller brush company  inc operations have been substantially completed and now consist of minimal monitoring efforts 
the company is awaiting final acceptance of the work from the department of health and environment of the state of kansas
