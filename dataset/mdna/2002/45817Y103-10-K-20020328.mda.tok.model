item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we derive our revenue from two primary sources product sales from cd s  cassettes  or books  and copyright revenue from third party use of our product masters and song catalog 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized when delivery has occurred and at the time title passes to the customer 
for product sales direct to consumers that allow a trial or acceptance period  title is not deemed to have passed nor revenue recognized until the acceptance periods have expired 
generally  these acceptance periods are fifteen days after receipt of product 
provisions for sales returns and allowances are made in the period in which the related products are shipped or title passes based on estimates derived from historical data 
the allowance represents the gross sales price and is recorded in the period in which the related products are shipped 
the returns allowance is presented  along with the allowance for doubtful accounts  as a reduction of accounts receivable in the accompanying financial statements 
revenue earned from licensing the use of songs or product masters in the company s song catalogs is generally recognized as payments are received from licensees 
if the company has information related to the licensed use of songs that would result in the revenue being fixed and determinable  and collection reasonably assured  then revenue is recognized in the periods in which the license revenue is earned 
allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  our management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
similarly  our management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of expense recorded if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
our accounts receivable balance at december  was million  net of allowances for returns of million and net of allowances for doubtful accounts of  product masters product masters  which include sound and video recordings and print masters  are amortized over their future estimated useful lives  using a method that reasonably relates to the amount of net revenue expected to be realized  not to exceed a three year period 
management periodically reviews the product masters amortization rates and adjusts the rate based on management s estimates for future sales 
in conjunction with such analysis  any amounts that do not appear to be fully recoverable are charged to expense during the period the loss becomes estimable 
the costs of producing a product master include the cost of the musical talent  the cost of the technical talent for engineering  directing and mixing  costs for the use of the equipment to record and produce the master  and studio facility charges 
a significant portion of these product master costs are capitalized costs of the company s resources  both personnel and equipment related  that can be primarily associated with the creation of the product master 
because consumer tastes  which are unpredictable and constantly changing  primarily determine the commercial success of any work  estimates must be made regarding future sales 
changes in management s judgment or estimates could result in different amortization rates 
our product masters balance at december  was million  net of accumulated amortization of million 
advance royalties and royalties payable royalties earned by publishers  authors  producers  songwriters and artists are charged to expense in the period in which the related product sale occurs 
advance royalties paid are capitalized if the past performance and current popularity of the artist author to whom the advance is made demonstrates such amounts will be recoverable from future royalties to be earned by the artist author 
such capitalized amounts are included as a component of other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
any portion of advances that subsequently appear not to be recoverable from future royalties are charged to expense during the period the loss becomes evident 
the amount of advance royalties totaled million at december  the company expects that any royalty advances will be recouped over future sales 
royalties payable to publishers  authors  producers  songwriters and artists from the related product sale or from the related copyright revenues are recorded in the period in which the revenue is recognized 
royalties payable are reduced for the estimated royalties that will not be paid due to product returns and bad debts based on historical experience 
royalty payments are generally made on a quarterly basis  days after the end of a quarter 
the amount of royalties payable totaled million at december  overview the company is a media communications company that produces  publishes and distributes christian music  books and related products 
integrity s music product formats include cassettes  compact discs  videos  dvd s and printed music 
the company produces praise and worship music in different musical styles for specific audiences such as children s music  gospel music for the african american audience  youth music and live worship music for adult audiences 
the company s recorded music products fall into two broad categories concept products and artist products

in addition to audio recordings  integrity produces christian music video and dvd products  printed music such as songbooks and sheet music  books and software 
the company has determined that its reportable segments are those that are based on the company s distribution channels 
these distribution channels are retail  direct to consumers  international and other channels 
the retail channel primarily represents sales to christian retailers through word  special event sales  sales of choral products and sales to the general market through sony music entertainment and its subsidiary epic records 
direct to consumers primarily represents sales from direct mail programs but also includes internet sales  television sales and sales of print products directly to churches  including sales of the celebration hymnal through a joint venture controlled by the company 
the international channel represents an international distribution network that reaches markets in countries 
all transactions with foreign entities  whether they are shipped from the united states or from one of the company s three subsidiaries in singapore  the united kingdom and australia  are reported in this segment 
christian retailers are the primary distribution channel for this segment  but there are also direct mail and other techniques used for these markets 
the other segment includes copyright revenue and other distribution sales 
the following historical analysis shows the percentage of sales by segment direct to consumer retail markets international other eliminations the direct to consumer segment  as a percent of total sales  increased largely due to the sales to time life for the songsworship continuity program 
as a result  the retail  international and other segments decreased as a percent of total sales  although net sales in these segments increased for the year as compared to the company s operating results may fluctuate significantly due to new product introductions  the timing of selling and marketing expenses  seasonality and changes in sales and product mixes 
results of operations the following table sets forth consolidated operating results expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated and the percentage change in such operating results between periods 
percentage of net sales year ended december net sales cost of sales gross profit marketing and fulfillment expenses general and administrative expenses income from operations before taxes and minority interest the year ended december  compared to the year ended december net sales increased to million in from million in the increases were mainly attributable to increases in the direct to consumer and retail market segments 
major new releases in included wow worship green and various releases of the songsworship series 
in  new products accounted for million units  or of the total units sold 
the new products released in featured several of integrity s best selling artists such as paul wilbur  paul baloche  ron kenoly and don moen 
three of the best selling albums of the year were songsworship shout to the lord  songsworship be glorified and wow worship green 
all three of the albums are compilations of the best praise and worship songs 
the wow albums were created in partnership with two other christian praise and worship song providers 
songsworship is a continuity series of praise and worship compilations developed in partnership with time life music 
according to time life music  the songsworship continuity series  released in the fourth quarter of  generated the strongest initial response for a music product launch in time life music s history 
over million consumers joined time life music s continuity series that was advertised on mainstream television in the united states 
time life music spent the equivalent of million in television advertising for this series 
due to the success of the songsworship series and the wow albums  substantial progress was made in in broadening the overall market for praise and worship music 
as the leader in this genre  integrity should benefit from this increased exposure 
due primarily to the success of time life music s songsworship continuity program  sales in the direct to consumer segment increased to million in from million in due to the retail release of the songsworship albums  sales in the retail segment increased to million in  from million in total wow sales were million in as compared to million in revenues in the international segment increased to million in from million in  due primarily to the release of the songsworship series in australia and new zealand 
other international divisions and subsidiaries were impacted negatively due to local competitive pressures and declining economic conditions in their areas  especially singapore and latin america 
management expects these conditions to continue in revenues in the other segment increased to million in  from million in  due primarily to additional song copyright royalties generated from the increase in product sales and third party use 
due primarily to the increase in sales  bad debts and returns were million in  compared to million in management does not expect the level of success of the songsworship series to be as substantial in as it was in revenue in from this series is projected to be approximately of the numbers 
however  the company and time life have been in discussions concerning new project ideas and various line extensions  and several new products are scheduled for release in in addition  the partnership agreement that resulted in the development and release of the three wow worship albums is still in place  and the company will continue to sell these albums 
however  the company does not expect to produce any new wow worship albums beyond the original three 
gross profit increased to million in from million in  due primarily to the increases in revenue discussed previously 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the songsworship sales to time life and due to an increase in the reserves for excess and obsolete inventory 
the gross margin percentage on sales to time life is lower because the company sells the product to time life at a wholesale price 
additionally  time life has no right of return on products sold to them 
the gross profit percentage in the direct to consumer segment declined to in from in the decline is attributable to songsworship sales whose gross margins are lower as the company sells the product to time life at a wholesale price 
the gross profit percentage in the retail segment increased to in from in  due primarily to the retail releases of the songsworship products 
the gross profit percentage in the international segment increased slightly to in from in additionally  reductions in the carrying value of product masters as a result of management s periodic estimates of the eventual recoupment of production costs increased to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  these amounts are included in cost of sales but are not specifically allocated to the segments 
the company s gross margins are generally higher in the direct to consumer segment  where sales are generally at retail value 
however  the songsworship release is sold to time life at a wholesale value and significantly lowers the gross margin for this segment 
the retail segment s gross margin is also affected by the sales mix of products that we distribute for third parties and artists products  which generally have lower gross margins than concept products 
management expects consolidated gross margin percentages to be higher in compared to due to lower sales of the songsworship series to time life 
the following table shows the gross margin by operating segment year ended december gross margin retail direct to consumer international other eliminations consolidated operating profit in the direct to consumer segment increased to million in from million in due to the songsworship sales mentioned earlier 
total gross margins increased  though the mix of songsworship sales resulted in a decline of the gross margin percentage from in to in marketing and fulfillment expenses increased compared to due to additional direct mail and marketing expenses for the company s own songsworship continuity club

due to increased sales for the year  copyright revenue and margins increased and  respectively  in compared to however  additional reserves for excess and obsolete inventory absorbed by this segment in resulted in an overall decline in operating profit compared to marketing and fulfillment expenses increased from million in to million in  due primarily to additional direct mail and marketing expenses incurred in the company s songsworship continuity club and the additional fulfillment expenses resulting from increased sales 
as a percentage of sales  the company s marketing and fulfillment expenses declined from in to in this decline is because the company bears no marketing and fulfillment expenses on songsworship sales to time life and songsworship sales into the general market 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily the result of additional personnel costs  increased professional fees  and the start up expenses for integrity publishers 
the increase in personnel costs is due to strategic additions in headcount for our vertical and urban product channels as well as added resources in the areas of marketing and radio promotion 
in addition  increases in commissions and incentive compensation substantially increased personnel expenses compared to professional fees increased primarily due to additional focus on investor relations and additional legal fees for trademark protection matters 
as a result of the above  income from operations increased to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  operating income increased to in from in interest expense decreased to  in from  in the decrease was a result of lower average indebtedness in in the quarter ended december   the company and its outside tax advisors undertook an extensive review of all deferred and current tax accounts

in the first days of release  over  consumers joined time life s continuity series 
due to the success of the songsworship series and the wow albums  substantial progress was made in in broadening the overall market for praise and worship music

gross profit as a percentage of sales was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to increased sales of the wow albums and the songsworship sales to time life  which have lower margins 
the gross profit percentage in the direct to consumer segment declined to in from in the decline is attributable to songsworship sales whose gross margins are lower as the company sells the product to time life at a wholesale price 
the gross profit percentage in the retail segment declined to in from in  due primarily to the increased sales of the wow albums 
because the wow albums were created in partnership with two other record companies  the company s margin is lower due to higher royalties 
the gross profit percentage in the international segment declined slightly to in from in additionally  reductions in the carrying value of product masters as a result of management s periodic estimates of the eventual recoupment of production costs increased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  these amounts are included in cost of sales  but are not specifically allocated to the segments 
the company s gross margins are generally higher in the direct to consumer segment where sales are generally at retail value 
however  the songsworship release is sold to time life at a wholesale value and significantly lowers the gross margin for this segment 
the retail segment s gross margin is affected by the sales mix of products that we distribute for third parties and artists products  which generally have lower gross margins than concept products 
the following table shows the gross margin by operating segment year ended december gross margin retail direct to consumer international other eliminations consolidated operating profit in the direct to consumer segment increased to million in from million in  due to songsworship sales mentioned earlier and due to lower marketing and fulfillment costs in versus in this segment

operating profit in the retail segment increased to million in from million in though retail gross margins rose million in compared to  most of this benefit was offset by increases in retail marketing and fulfillment expenses resulting from the higher level of sales 
as a percentage of sales  marketing and fulfillment expenses in the retail segment declined to in from in operating profit in the international segment decreased to million in from million in the net decrease is a result of a slight increase in international s gross margin  offset by larger increases in applicable general and administrative expenses in compared to the increase in the international segment s general and administrative expenses for is due to additional expenditures for market development and personnel additions 
the operating profit in the other segment decreased  or  due to increases in marketing and fulfillment expenses not charged to specific segments and due to amounts charged to expense for record masters that do not appear to be fully recoverable 
marketing and fulfillment expenses increased to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  however  marketing and fulfillment expenses decreased to in from in the company negotiated a reduction in its fulfillment services rate that was effective for the aggregate dollar amount of marketing and fulfillment expenses increased as a result of higher volumes in the retail segment 
these higher volumes were partially offset by the benefit of a reduction in the fulfillment services rate being charged 
also offsetting the increase were lower marketing costs due to fewer direct mail campaigns in the direct to consumer segment 
the primary reason for the decline as a percent of sales is that songsworship sales in the direct to consumer segment bear no marketing or fulfillment expenses when the company sells directly to time life 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was due to several new positions  company wide cost of living increases and certain professional fees 
also included in these amounts is approximately million from the international segment 
the additional personnel were needed to support the anticipated growth of the company

liquidity and capital resources the company historically has financed its operations through cash generated from operations and from borrowings under a line of credit and term notes as needed 
the company s need for cash varies from quarter to quarter based on product releases and scheduled marketing promotions

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas  business combinations  and statement no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas supercedes apb  business combinations  and requires the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas supercedes apb  intangible assets and primarily requires that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized and will be tested for impairment at least annually at a reporting unit level 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas had no effect  and the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material affect  on the company s reported results of operations  financial position or cash flows because the company has not entered into such a transaction 
however  should the company do so in the future  the company will comply with the provisions of fas and fas in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas requires that obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset be recorded as a liability when those obligations are incurred  with the amount of the liability initially measured at fair value 
sfas will be effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s reported results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in august  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supercedes sfas and applies to all long lived assets including discontinued operations and consequently amends accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas requires that long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and  generally  its provisions are to be applied prospectively 
adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s reported results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in november  the fasb s emerging issues task force reached a consensus on eitf issue  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products  which is a codification of eitf  and this issue presumes that consideration from a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products is a reduction in the selling prices of the vendor s product and  therefore  should be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendor s income statement which could lead to negative revenue under certain circumstances 
revenue reduction is required unless the consideration related to a separate identifiable benefit and the benefit s fair value can be established 
this issue is to be applied retroactively in the first fiscal quarter beginning after december  adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s reported results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operating results has been moderate in recent years  reflecting generally lower rates of inflation in the economy and relative stability in the company s cost of sales 
while inflation has not had  and the company does not expect that it will have  a material impact upon operating results  inflation may affect the company s business in the future 
risk factors our markets are highly competitive 
the markets for christian music  books and related products are highly competitive 
we face competition from other record companies  music publishers  book publishers  entertainment companies and multimedia companies that seek to offer recorded music  video products  software  printed music and books to the public 
many of these competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have significantly longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we 
this provides them with the ability to launch more new products  spend more on marketing those products  and pay more to artists  authors and songwriters for new music  book manuscripts and songs 
our ability to compete in this market depends largely on the skill and creativity of our employees and their relationships with artists  our ability to recruit and retain new and established artists  songwriters  authors and distributive relationships  the expansion and utilization of our catalog  the acquisition of licenses to enable us to create compilation packages  the effective and efficient distribution of our products  and our ability to build upon and maintain our reputation for producing  licensing  acquiring  marketing and distributing high quality christian media products 
in addition  the future success of our sales and marketing efforts through the internet will be affected by existing competition and by additional entrants to the electronic commerce market 
our business is subject to constantly changing consumer tastes 
our products consist of recorded music  video productions  books and printed music 
each music or video recording  book or printed product is an individual artistic work 
the commercial success of a music or video recording  book or printed product depends on consumer taste  the quality and acceptance of competing offerings released into the marketplace at or near the same time  the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities  general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors  all of which can change quickly 
accordingly  there can be no assurance as to the financial success of any particular product  the timing of such success  or the popularity of any particular artist 
our future success depends on our ability to continue to develop recorded music  videos  printed music and other content that is interesting and engaging to our target audience 
if our audience determines that our content does not reflect its tastes  then our audience size could decrease  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
our ability to develop compelling content depends on several factors  including the following quality of our editorial staff  technical expertise of our production staff  access to worship leaders  and access to songwriters furthermore  we must invest significant amounts for product development prior to the release of any product 
these costs may not be recovered if the release is unsuccessful 
there can be no assurance that our products will be successful releases or that any product will generate revenues sufficient to cover the cost of product development 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our business is dependent on access to distribution channels 
we distribute our products through a multi channel distribution system comprised of direct to consumer sales  retail sales  international  and license arrangements 
the direct to consumer channel primarily represents sales from direct mail programs such as our continuity clubs  direct response television to time life music  internet sales and sales directly to churches  including through the company s hymnal joint venture 
members of a continuity club receive monthly mailings containing a feature recording  which they may then accept and pay for or return within a specified time 
the performance of these clubs could be affected by a number of factors including the maturity of our mailing lists  such that consumers no longer desire our products and cancel their participation  our failure to expand and revise our mailing lists to include new potential customers  or the inability to secure new mailing lists from which to build ours  our failure to offer new and appealing products to these customers  and increases in the cost of mailing and shipping  or increased regulation of mail order sales 
in addition  our results could also be affected if time life music were to reduce its marketing efforts for the songsworship continuity series on television  or if the consumer popularity of the songsworship products were to decline 
we also sell our products through the internet through our websites www 
integritymusic 
com and www 
songsworship 
com 
revenues from these sites are not currently a significant part of our business 
the future success of on line sales and marketing efforts cannot be adequately determined at this time  particularly due to the short history of the electronic commerce market 
results will also be affected by existing competition and by additional entrants to the market  many of whom may have substantially greater resources than we 
currently  we rely on word s sales force to perform christian retail market sales functions for us pursuant to a contract with them that extends through january in addition  we recently concluded an important global marketing and distribution agreement with sony music entertainment and its subsidiary epic records for the distribution of our releases in the general retail markets 
our international area is dependent on our subsidiaries and a network of independent distributors and exporters reaching markets in countries 
our retail and international distribution channels rely heavily on third parties to sell and deliver our products 
we cannot quickly replace these third parties should they fail to perform  nor can we assume their duties in a timely manner 
as a result  the failure by any of these parties to fulfill their duties effectively and efficiently will immediately and adversely affect our results of operations 
should we encounter difficulty with our existing distribution methods  or be unable to further develop our distribution systems successfully in the future  our business  results of operation and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
because spending on our products is dependent on discretionary consumer spending  we are susceptible to fluctuations in general economic conditions 
we believe that revenue from sales of recorded music  video products  software  printed music and books are dependent on discretionary consumer spending 
our revenue will therefore be subject to fluctuations based upon general economic conditions in the united states and the foreign countries in which we do business 
if there is a general economic downturn or recession in the united states or in such foreign countries  general consumer spending in these markets likely would decline  and our revenues may decrease as a result 
we depend on the continued popularity of christian music 
we produce records  video productions and printed music in the christian music segment of the industry 
our artists are all in this segment of the market 
although we believe that this sector will continue to grow  consumer taste is unpredictable and constantly changing 
if tastes move away from this type of music and we do not develop any alternatives  we may not be able to sell enough recordings to be profitable 
we may have difficulty enforcing our intellectual property rights 
we consider our copyrights  trademarks and other similar intellectual property to be a valuable part of our business 
to protect our intellectual property rights  we rely upon copyright and trademark laws  as well as confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants 
the decreasing cost of electronic equipment and related technology  however  has made it easier to create unauthorized versions of audio and audiovisual products such as compact discs  videotapes and dvds 
a substantial portion of our revenue comes from the sale of audio and audiovisual products potentially subject to unauthorized copying 
similarly  advances in internet technology  such as peer to peer and mp technology  as well as the emergence of file sharing services  have increasingly made it possible for computer users to share audio and audiovisual information without the permission of the copyright owners and without paying royalties to holders of applicable intellectual property or other rights 
these developments may hinder our ability to sell our products through traditional retail outlets  and there can be no assurance that the application of existing law will provide sufficient protection from misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property rights 
there can also be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to others current or future intellectual property rights 
if we were to fail to develop effective means of protecting our intellectual property or entertainment related products and services  or to obtain appropriate relief through the judicial process or the complete enforcement of judicial decisions issued in our favor in the event our rights were to be violated by third parties  our results of operations and financial position would likely suffer 
portions of our business are dependent on cross licensing arrangements 
we license the rights to certain recordings and compositions from third parties for recording and re recording of music to produce compilations and to expand our catalog 
we also seek to license the rights to our recordings and compositions to third parties for a royalty or a flat fee 
these cross licensing arrangements are generally made possible by existing industry practices based on reciprocity 
if these practices change  we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain licenses from third parties on satisfactory terms  or at all  and our business  financial condition and operating results  particularly with respect to compilation products  could be materially and adversely affected 
we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our domain names  which could decrease the value of these domain names 
our trademark rights may not be sufficient to prevent third parties from acquiring or using domain names that infringe or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and domain names 
we currently hold the internet domain name integritymusic 
com  songsworship 
com  as well as various other related domain names 
we do not hold the domain names integrity 
com  integrity 
org or integrity 
net 
domain names generally have been regulated by the commerce department through a contract with network solutions  inc  a company that has exclusively administered the so called top level domain names ending in 
com  
net and 
org 
we expect that the regulation of domain names in the united states and in foreign countries will continue to evolve and change 
for example  the commerce department appointed the nonprofit internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann to further privatize the administration of domain names and to address regulatory issues  including the appointment of additional domain name registrars and the adoption of new domain name dispute policies 
the icann recently has appointed several new domain name registrars who will sell and administer new domain names  such as the 
biz and 
info domains  and the effect this will have on the regulation of domain names is uncertain 
internet regulatory bodies also could establish additional top level domains or modify the rights of current holders of domain names 
as a result  the value of the integritymusic 
com domain could be diluted and decrease the number of visitors to our websites  and we may not acquire or maintain the integritymusic 
com domain name in all of the countries in which we intend to conduct business 
our reserves for product returns may prove inadequate 
most of our products are sold on a returnable basis  which is standard music and book publishing industry practice 
we set reserves for future returns of products estimated based on return policies and experience 
we expect that our actual return experience will be within standard industry parameters and our historical experience 
however  we may in the future experience an increase in returns over our established reserves 
if this occurs our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause the market price for our class a common stock to be volatile 
our results of operations are subject to quarterly fluctuations and seasonal variations 
in particular  our revenues are affected by end of the year holiday sales 
in accordance with industry practice  we record revenues for music products when the products are shipped to retailers 
in anticipation of holiday sales  retailers purchase products from us prior to december 
in addition  changes in the timing of new product releases can also cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results because of the marketing costs involved in launching a new product and the delay in receiving any sales revenue from the new product 
for example  if releases planned for the peak holiday season are delayed  our operating results could be adversely affected  which could in turn cause the price of the class a common stock to fluctuate 
increases in the costs of cd s or cassettes could harm our profitability increases in the costs of producing a cd or cassette due to increases in petroleum prices or other costs associated with the manufacture and duplication of cd s or cassettes could adversely affect our profitability 
although we do not manufacture these products internally  any significant price increase to our suppliers could result in higher cd or cassette prices to integrity 
we may not be able to pass on these price increases to our customers 
increases in mailing  paper  printing and delivery costs could harm our profitability 
increases in postal rates  as well as in the costs of paper  printing and delivery  could adversely affect our direct response programs 
we generally ship orders by third class mail with the united states postal service  and we rely heavily on discounts from the basic postal rate structure  such as special rates for bulk mailings  sorting by zip code and carrier routes 
any increase in postal rates  paper  printing or delivery costs could adversely affect our profitability 
we depend on certain senior executives who have experience unique to our industry 
our success has been largely dependent on the skills  experience and efforts of our senior management 
although we have employment agreements with some of our senior executives  they could still choose to leave integrity at any time 
if they did  we would have difficulty replacing them with individuals who had an equal level of experience in the christian music and related products industries 
this could adversely affect our daily operations  creative development and financial performance 
our new book publishing business has a limited operating history 
our book publishing subsidiary  integrity publishers  inc  has a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of its business and prospects  having only commenced its initial operations in august  the prospects for our book publishing operation must be considered in light of the risks  difficulties and uncertainties frequently encountered by businesses in an early stage of development  particularly operations in industries involving many larger and more established competitors 
these risks include our ability to publish compelling and unique christian book content  successfully market and sell our books  and effectively develop new and maintain existing relationships with book distributors and other persons with which we do business 
the ability to attract successful and highly qualified authors and illustrators is critical to our future success 
competition for this type of resource is intense  and authors and illustrators have many options in terms of publisher affiliation 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop relationships with or retain superior quality authors and illustrators  and any failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results 
we may be subject to liability for misuse of users private information 
it is our policy that we will not willfully disclose any individually identifiable information about any customer to a third party without the customer s consent unless required by law 
this policy is available to customers when they initially register on integritymusic 
com website and is also easily accessible on our websites 
despite this policy  if third persons were able to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate  or if we inadvertently disclose  our customers personal information or credit card information  we could be subject to liability 
these liabilities could include claims for unauthorized purchases with credit card information  impersonation or other similar fraud claims 
they could also include claims for other misuses of personal information  such as for unauthorized marketing purposes 
these claims could result in litigation which may cause us to incur substantial costs 
we could incur additional expenses if new laws or regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if these authorities choose to investigate our privacy practices 
while we have implemented and intend to implement additional programs designed to enhance the protection of the privacy of our customers  these programs may not conform with laws or regulations that are adopted 
integrity is controlled by the coleman family 
our chairman  president and chief executive officer  p 
michael coleman  and his family beneficially own  shares of class a common stock and all  shares of class b common stock outstanding 
this represents approximately of the total voting power of all classes of our voting stock 
as a result  mr 
coleman is able to elect all of our directors  further amend our amended certificate of incorporation the amended certificate  effect or prevent a merger  sale of assets or other business acquisition or disposition  and otherwise control the outcome of actions requiring stockholder approval 
limited public trading of our class a common stock may result in increased price volatility 
although our class a common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market  the volume of shares traded during any particular period has historically been low 
any sale or purchase of our class a common stock in the public markets that is large in relation to recent trading volumes for the class a common stock may therefore disproportionately affect the market price of our shares 
we cannot assure you that a more active and liquid market for the shares of class a common stock will develop 
our class a common stock has limited voting rights 
our amended certificate limits the voting rights of our class a common stock 
each share of our class a common stock is entitled to one vote  while each share of our class b common stock is entitled to ten votes on all matters with respect to which our stockholders have a right to vote 
both classes of our stock generally vote together as a single class 
the shares of class b common stock are convertible into shares of class a common stock on a share for share basis at the election of the holder 
also  our class b common stock must be converted to shares of class a common stock automatically if it is transferred  except for transfers to or for the benefit of certain of mr 
coleman s relatives 
we do not have the authority to issue additional class b common stock except as dividends or distributions on outstanding class b common stock proportional to dividends or distributions on class a common stock 
the disproportionate voting rights of our class b common stock could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
these disproportionate voting rights may also make us a less attractive target for a takeover than we otherwise might be  and render more difficult or discourage a merger proposal  a tender offer  or a proxy contest  even if such actions were favored by holders of our class a common stock 
holders of class a common stock might therefore be deprived of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over the then prevailing market price 
the provisions of our charter documents and delaware law could discourage a take over of integrity 
our board of directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock 
our board of directors  without approval of the stockholders  is also authorized to establish the following provisions of any preferred stock voting  dividend  redemption  conversion  liquidation  and other provisions 
the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock 
further  the issuance of preferred stock could make more difficult  or discourage  a third party s attempt to acquire control of us 
finally  we are also subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which may render more difficult a change in control of integrity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk is limited to fluctuations in interest rates as they pertain to the company s borrowings under its credit facility 
as of april   the company paid interest on borrowings at either lasalle s base rate or an adjusted libor  plus an interest rate margin 
the interest rate margin is based upon the leverage ratio as of the last day of a fiscal quarter 
prior to april   under the bank austria credit facility  the company paid interest on borrowings at either the lender s base rate plus  or libor plus 
prior to september  the interest rate was the bank s base rate plus or libor plus 
in the event that interest rates were to increase basis points  the company s interest expense would increase and income before income tax would decrease by  assuming current debt levels are maintained 
this amount is determined solely by considering the impact of the hypothetical change in the interest rate on the company s borrowing cost without consideration of other factors such as actions management might take to mitigate its exposure to interest rate changes 
the company is also exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
the company does not use any hedging transactions in order to modify the risk from these foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations 
the company also does not use financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any leveraged derivatives
