forward looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  some of which cannot be predicted or quantified based on current expectations 
consequently  future events and results could differ materially from those set forth in  contemplated by  or underlying the forward looking statements contained in this report 
statements in this report  particularly in item business  item legal proceedings  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and the notes to consolidated financial statements describe certain factors  among others  that could contribute to or cause such differences 
some of the factors that may affect future results are discussed below 
o the company is subject to global economic and market conditions  including the current conditions affecting the results of the company s customers 
the company s results have been and could continue to be adversely affected depending on the length and severity of the current economic downturn 
the company may experience a continued decline in sales as a result of the current economic conditions and the lack of visibility relating to future orders 
in response to economic conditions  the company from time to time adjusts its cost structure to reduce spending where appropriate 
a failure by the company to reduce costs in a timely manner could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
in addition  notwithstanding such cost control measures  a continuing decline in the economy that adversely affects the company s customers would likely adversely affect the company as well 
o the company s consolidated results of operations depends upon  among other things  its ability to maintain and increase sales volumes with existing customers  its ability to attract new customers and the financial condition of its customers 
the company cannot predict with any certainty whether it will be able to maintain or improve upon historical sales volumes with existing customers  or whether it will be able to attract new customers 
o the company may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors 
the market for the company s products and services is intensely competitive and subject to constant technological change 
the company expects this competition to further intensify in the future 
some competitors are large companies with greater financial  marketing and product development resources than the company s 
in addition  new competitors may enter the company s key markets 
this may place the company at a disadvantage in responding to competitors pricing strategies  technological advances and other initiatives 
o in many cases the company s products compete directly with those offered by other manufacturers and distributors 
if any of the company s competitors were to develop products or services that are more cost effective or technically superior  demand for the company s product offerings could decrease 
o the company purchases certain materials and components for its products from various suppliers  some of which are located outside of the us any loss of  or interruption of supply from key suppliers may require the company to find new suppliers 
this could result in production or development delays while new suppliers are located  which could substantially impair operating results 
o the company s pc products contain electronic components  subassemblies and software that in some cases are supplied through sole or limited source third party suppliers 
although the company does not anticipate any problems procuring supplies in the near term  there can never be any assurance that parts and supplies will be available in a timely manner and at reasonable prices 
if the availability of these or other components used in the manufacture of our products was to decrease  or if the prices for these components was to increase significantly  operating costs and expenses could be adversely affected 
o a significant portion of the company s revenues are derived from the sale of products manufactured using licensed patents  software and or technology 
failure to renew these licenses on favorable terms or at all could force the company to stop manufacturing and distributing these products and the company s financial condition could be adversely affected 
o the company s inventory is subject to risk due to changes in market demand for particular products 
the resulting excess and or obsolete inventory could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
o the company currently has operations located in nine countries outside the united states  and non us sales accounted for of the company s revenue during the company s future results could be adversely affected by several factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a country s economic or political conditions  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and natural disasters 
o the company s current domestic credit facility expires on june  if the company is unable to renew or replace this credit facility  its liquidity and capital resources may be adversely affected 
other factors that could contribute to or cause such differences include  but are not limited to  unanticipated developments in any one or more of the following areas i the effect on the company of volatility in the price of paper and periodic increases in postage rates  ii the operation of the company s management information systems  iii significant changes in the computer products retail industry  especially relating to the distribution and sale of such products  iv the potential for expanded imposition of state sales taxes  use taxes  or other taxes on direct marketing and e commerce companies  v timely availability of existing and new products  vi risks involved with e commerce  including possible loss of business and customer dissatisfaction if outages or other computer related problems should preclude customer access to the company  vii risks associated with delivery of merchandise to customers by utilizing common delivery services such as the united states postal service and ups  including possible strikes and contamination  viii borrowing costs  ix changes in taxes due to changes in the mix of us and us revenue  x pending or threatened litigation and investigations and xi the availability of key personnel  as well as other risk factors which may be detailed from time to time in the company s securities and exchange commission filings

the market for computer products is subject to intense price competition  which the company anticipates will continue to have a negative impact on gross margins 
gross profit margins on industrial product sales remained consistent in from and  but continuing lower sales contributions of these higher margin products negatively impacted the company s overall gross profit margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million  or of net sales in  compared to million  or of net sales in this was due to a variety of reasons  including the following 
in  the company incurred television advertising expenses related to sales of its pcs 
the company incurred consulting costs associated with implementation of a new e commerce internet platform and new order entry and fulfillment software

for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales in this increase resulted from higher personnel and related costs in both north america and europe  reflecting the increase in the worldwide relationship marketing sales force and higher bad debt expense 
these expense increases were partially offset by lower advertising costs associated with catalog mailings as the company s focus continues to shift to relationship sales and decreases in staffing levels in areas other than relationship marketing during the year to adjust to the lower level of incoming business

in addition  liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing and to convert those assets that are no longer required to meet existing strategic and financing objectives into cash 
therefore  liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist of current and potentially available funds for use in achieving long range business objectives and meeting debt service commitments 
currently  the company s liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
the company s cash balance increased million to million during the year ended december  the company s working capital was million at december   down from million at the end of this was due principally to a million decrease in accounts receivable and a million decrease in inventories  offset by a million increase in cash  a million decrease in notes payable to banks and a million decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the policies below have been identified as critical to the company s business operations and understanding the results of operations 
certain accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty  and as result  actual results could differ from those estimates 
these judgments are based on historical experience  observation of trends in the industry  information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
management believes that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that the company may be subject to  and the financial statements of the company accurately reflect management s best estimate of the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of the company for the years presented 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
the company recognizes sales upon shipment of products to customers since title passes upon shipment 
reserves for estimated returns and allowances are provided when sales are recorded based on historical experience and current trends 
the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors  including an analysis of customer accounts and the company s historical experience with accounts receivable write offs 
the analysis includes the age of the receivable  the financial condition of a customer or industry  and general economic conditions 
in circumstances where we are aware of customer charge backs or a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  a specific reserve for bad debts applicable to amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected is recorded 
in those situations with ongoing discussions  the amount of bad debt recognized is based on the status of the discussions 
while bad debt allowances have been within expectations and the provisions established  there can be no guarantee that the company will continue to experience the same allowance rate it has in the past 
inventories 
the company values its inventories at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
reserves for slow moving and obsolete or unmarketable merchandise are provided based on historical experience and current product demand 
the adequacy of these reserves is evaluated quarterly 
while markdowns and obsolescence have been within expectations and the provisions established  there can be no guarantee that the company will continue to experience the same level of markdowns it has in the past 
long lived assets 
management exercises judgment in evaluating the company s long lived assets for impairment 
we believe the company will generate sufficient undiscounted cash flow to more than recover the investments made in property  plant and equipment  as well as goodwill and other intangibles recorded as a result of acquisitions 
while the company believes that its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect its evaluations income taxes 
the determination of the company s tax provision is complex due to operations in several tax jurisdictions outside the united states 
the company is subject to periodic examination from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these examinations include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with our various filing positions  the company records reserves for probable exposures 
the company is currently undergoing an examination of its tax year ended december  by the united states internal revenue service 
based on the company s evaluation of its tax positions  the company believes it has appropriately accrued for probable exposures 
deferred tax assets 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
the realization of net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s ability to generate future taxable income 
where it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized  the company has provided a valuation allowance 
in preparing estimates of future taxable income  the company has used the same assumptions and projections utilized in its internal forecasts and estimates 
recent accounting developments in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  business combinations and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
sfas requires the use of a non amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles 
under a non amortization approach  goodwill and certain intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead would be reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its fair value 
the company will be required within six months from the date of adoption to test its goodwill for impairment under the new standard  which could result in an adjustment to the amount of recorded goodwill 
the company is currently assessing  but has not yet determined  the impact of sfas and sfas on its financial position and results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes the cost associated with the asset retirement obligation by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is adjusted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supercedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  however  it retains many of its fundamental provisions 
sfas requires that long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
therefore  discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred 
sfas also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
implications to the company from the adoption of a european common currency the countries of the european union have adopted a single currency  the euro 
the euro came into existence on january   and could have been used for transactions within and between the countries of the economic and monetary union austria  belgium  finland  france  germany  netherlands  ireland  italy  luxembourg  portugal and spain  with national currencies expressed as a denomination national currency units of the euro 
during the three year transition period following its introduction  countries were allowed to transact business both in the euro and in their own currencies at fixed exchange rates 
on january   the euro became the only currency in economic and monetary union countries 
the company has extensive operations in europe  including france  germany  italy  the netherlands  spain  sweden  england and scotland 
it also sells into additional countries in europe 
for the fiscal year  approximately of the company s net sales were in europe 
with the exception of sweden and the united kingdom  all of the countries in which the company has operations are participants in the european common currency  the euro 
the introduction of the euro has not required a significant modification to the company s accounting systems and has not had a significant adverse impact on european sales or pricing 
there is no expectation of a significant adverse impact in the future 
the company adopted the euro for internal systems and reporting as of january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risks  which include changes in us and international interest rates as well as changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other 
the company has no involvement with derivative financial instruments and does not use them for trading purposes 
changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar may positively or negatively affect systemax s sales  gross margins  operating expenses and retained earnings as expressed in us dollars 
the company may enter into foreign currency options or forward exchange contracts aimed at limiting in part the impact of certain currency fluctuations  but as of december  the company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts
