item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a pharmaceutical development company committed to building a portfolio of products with significant commercial potential in select therapeutic areas 
our initial focus is on developing products for migraine therapy  a global market expected to exceed billion in mt  our proprietary formulation combining metoclopramide hydrochloride and naproxen sodium  is being developed as an oral  first line treatment for migraine pain and associated symptoms 
we have completed all planned phase pivotal clinical trials for mt  which consistently demonstrated mt s effectiveness in treating migraine pain 
mt  our injectable product candidate consisting of a new and improved formulation of dhe  is being developed to provide long lasting pain relief for severe migraine 
mt is currently in two phase pivotal trials comparing mt s efficacy with placebo 
we expect to complete both of these trials by the end of the first half of mt is being developed as a co active acute migraine therapy combining the activity of a triptan with that of a long acting  non steroidal  anti inflammatory drug in a single tablet 
mt is currently in phase development 
we have discontinued further development activities related to mt  our early stage migraine product candidate in licensed from roche  based upon unexpected phase trial results 
specifically  our business activities have included 
product candidate research and development  
designing and funding clinical trials for our product candidates  
regulatory and clinical affairs  
intellectual property prosecution and expansion  and 
business development including product acquisition or in licensing 
historically  we have financed our operations and internal growth primarily through private placements of preferred stock and our initial public offering rather than through collaborative or partnership agreements 
therefore  we have no research funding or collaboration payments payable to us nor have we received any payments that are refundable or subject to performance milestones 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception and we have not generated any revenue 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was  our historical operating losses have resulted principally from our research and development activities  including phase clinical trial activities for our product candidate mt and phase clinical trial activities for our product candidates mt and mt  and general and administrative expenses 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses over the next several years as we complete our development of mt and apply for regulatory approval  continue development of our other migraine therapeutic product candidates  and acquire and develop product portfolios in other therapeutic areas 
our results may vary depending on many factors  including 
the progress of mt  mt and mt in the regulatory process  
the establishment of collaborations for the development and commercialization of any of our migraine product candidates  and 
the acquisition or in licensing of other therapeutic product candidates 
our ability to generate revenue is dependent upon our ability  alone or with others  to successfully develop mt or our other migraine product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals and  alone or with others  successfully manufacture and market our future products 
in october  we received  in net proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock in our initial public offering  including the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
all of our outstanding preferred shares were converted into shares of our common stock upon the completion of our initial public offering 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees  we recorded deferred compensation of approximately  in the years ended december  the deferred compensation amounts were recorded as a component of stockholders equity and are being amortized as charges to operations over the vesting period of the options using the straight line method 
the vesting period of these options is generally three years 
approximately  and  of deferred compensation expense was charged to operations in the years ended december  and december   respectively 
as of december   we anticipate charging to operations additional amounts of amortization of deferred compensation of approximately   and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
historical results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue we generated no revenue during the year ended december  or the year ended december  in the future  we plan to generate revenue from upfront and milestone payments related to collaborations for the development and commercialization of product candidates and if any of our product candidates are sold  from royalties from such sales 
research and development research and development expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this net decrease of  was due primarily to a net decrease in direct product development costs of  the costs related to the research and development of mt decreased by  in  due primarily to decreased clinical trial activities 
during the year  while conducting three phase clinical trials  expenditures related to mt were at their highest historical level 
during the year  the research and development costs related to mt and mt increased by  and  respectively  as a result of increased clinical trial activities compared to the prior year 
the costs associated with all other product candidates increased  other research and development costs increased by  including an increase of  in personnel costs 
total amortization of deferred stock compensation included in research and development expenses was  for as compared to  for we expect that research and development expenditures will increase in due to the continuation or expansion of clinical trials  the expansion of pharmaceutical development and toxicology study expenditures  and the preparation of nda s for mt and mt we have included in our research and development expenses the personnel costs related to our research activities and costs related to clinical trial preparations  monitoring expenses  and regulatory matters 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase of  includes an increase of  in personnel and related benefits  an increase of  in fees  services and other costs related to public disclosure and investor communication activities  along with increases in other general operating expenses that totaled  total amortization of deferred compensation included in general and administrative expenses was  for as compared to  for we expect that general and administrative expenditures will continue to increase due to increasing fees and expenses associated with the growth in our market research  business development and commercialization efforts 
we have included in our general and administrative expenses the costs of administrative personnel and related facility costs along with legal  accounting and professional fees  services  and other costs related to public disclosure and investor communication activities 
interest income  net net interest income increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  interest income increased due to increased levels of cash and cash equivalents available for investing 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue we generated no revenue during the year ended december  or the year ended december  research and development research and development expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase of  was due primarily to a  increase in clinical trial costs of mt costs associated with mt increased  due primarily to increased clinical trial activities 
the costs associated with mt reflected a net increase of  due to an increase of  in toxicology and pharmaceutical development expenses being offset by a  decrease from the prior year s  product licensing expense 
mt costs decreased  reflecting the directing of development efforts toward mt additional other research and development costs increased  including an increase of  in personnel costs  of which  represented increased amortization of deferred stock compensation 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase of  resulted from increases of  in personnel and related benefits  of which  represented increased amortization of deferred stock compensation 
additionally  professional and consulting fees increased by  and an increase of  was reflected in other costs related to our expanded operational infrastructure 
interest income  net net interest income increased to  for the year ended december  from a net interest expense of  for the year ended december  interest income increased  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  due to increased levels of cash and cash equivalents available for investing 
during the year ended december  there was nominal interest expense while interest expense was  for the year ended december  related to a promissory note that was converted to preferred stock during the period 
income taxes as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million 
these federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards begin to expire in the utilization of the loss carryforwards to reduce future income taxes will depend on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the net loss carryforwards 
in addition  the maximum annual use of net loss carryforwards is limited in certain situations where changes occur in our stock ownership 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations and internal growth primarily through private placements of preferred stock and our initial public offering  resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us of  at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  a decrease of  as compared to december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents resulted primarily from our operating activities 
cash used by operations of  during the year ended december  represented a net loss of  offset by non cash charges of  an increase in prepaid and other assets of  and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  cash used in investing activities of  during the year ended december  reflected the purchase of equipment 
cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december   totaled  reflecting the net proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and warrants 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  an increase of  as compared to december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents resulted primarily from our financing activities  offset by the cash used in operating activities 
cash used by operations of  during the year ended december  represented a net loss of  offset by non cash charges of  a decrease in prepaid and other assets of  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to the increased spending in our clinical activities 
cash used in investing activities of  during the year ended december  reflected the purchase of equipment 
cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december   which totaled  was generated primarily by net proceeds of  from the sales of the series e preferred stock in march  net proceeds of  from the sales of the series f preferred stock in august  and net proceeds of  from our initial public offering in october we believe that our existing liquidity and capital resources  including the proceeds from our initial public offering  will be sufficient to complete our on going and planned clinical trials reflected in the description of our business  to conduct appropriate development studies  and to satisfy our other anticipated cash needs for operating expenses for at least the next two years 
below is a summary of our contractual obligations for our operational leases 
year amount total  we do not expect to make any material capital expenditures during the next two years 
in addition  we do not currently have any milestone or other required material payment obligations during that period 
however  we cannot be certain that additional funding will not be required and  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including 
the number and progress of our clinical trials and other trials and studies  
our ability to negotiate favorable terms with various contractors assisting in these trials and studies  
our success in commercializing the products to which we have rights  and 
costs incurred to enforce and defend our patent claims and other intellectual rights 
recent accounting pronouncements on june   the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations sfas and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations  except for qualifying business combinations that were initiated prior to july  sfas also includes new criteria to recognize intangible assets separately from goodwill 
the requirements of sfas are effective for any business combination accounted for by the purchase method that is completed after june  under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  for impairment 
separate intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the provisions of sfas requiring non amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets apply to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets acquired after june  with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   the company is required to adopt sfas on january   however  the adoption of sfas and sfas is not expected to have an impact on the company s operating results or stockholders equity for the periods presented 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas requires an entity to record a liability for an obligation associated with the retirement of an asset at the time that the liability is incurred by capitalizing the cost as part of the carrying value of the related asset and depreciating it over the remaining useful life of that asset 
the standard is effective for the company beginning january   and its adoption is not expected to have an impact on the company s operating results or stockholders equity 
in october  the fsab issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
sfas addresses how and when to measure impairment on long lived assets and how to account for long lived assets that an entity plans to dispose of either through sale  abandonment  exchange  or distribution to owners 
the new provisions supersede sfas  which addressed asset impairment  and certain impairment  and certain provisions of apb opinion related to reporting to the effects of the disposal of a business segment and requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be recorded in the period in which the losses are incurred rather than the measurement date 
under sfas  more dispositions may qualify for discontinued operations treatment in the income statement 
the provisions of sfas became effective for the company january  and are not expected to have a material impact on the company s operating results or stockholders equity 
factors affecting the company s prospects we depend heavily on the success of our product candidate  mt  which may never be approved for commercial use 
if we are unable to develop  gain approval of or commercialize mt  we may never be profitable 
since our founding  we have invested a significant portion of our time and financial resources in the development of mt and anticipate that for the foreseeable future our ability to achieve profitability will be dependent on its successful development  approval and commercialization 
many factors could negatively affect the success of our efforts to develop and commercialize mt  including 
negative  inconclusive or otherwise unfavorable results from our carcinogenicity studies or from any other studies or clinical trials  
an inability to obtain  or delay in obtaining  regulatory approval for the commercialization of mt  
an inability to establish collaborative arrangements with third parties for the manufacture and commercialization of mt  or any disruption of any of these arrangements  if established  
a failure to achieve market acceptance of mt  
significant delays in our carcinogenicity studies  
any demand by the fda that we conduct additional clinical trials or other studies and the expenses relating thereto  and 
significant increases in the costs of any additional carcinogenicity studies 
we have incurred losses since inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
we do not have a current source of product revenue and may never be profitable 
we have incurred losses in each year since our inception and we currently have no source of product revenue 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to incur significant and increasing operating losses and do not know when or if we will generate product revenue 
we expect that the amount of our operating losses will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of increases and decreases in development efforts  the timing of payments that we may receive from others  and other factors 
our ability to achieve profitability is dependent on a number of factors  including our ability to 
develop and obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates  
negotiate collaborative agreements under which we receive upfront and milestone payments for our product candidates  
successfully commercialize our product candidates  which may include entering into collaborative agreements  and 
secure contract manufacturing and distribution services 
if we  or our collaborators  do not obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals  we will be unable to commercialize our product candidates 
our product candidates under development are subject to extensive domestic and foreign regulation 
the fda regulates  among other things  the development  testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  record keeping  labeling  storage  approval  advertisement  promotion  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
if we market our products abroad  they are also subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments 
none of our product candidates  including mt  have been approved for sale in the united states or any foreign market 
we will need to complete preclinical  toxicology  genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies  as well as clinical trials  on these product candidates in support of nda submissions to the fda for approval to market the product candidates 
if we are unable to obtain and maintain fda and foreign governmental approvals for our product candidates  we will not be permitted to sell them 
approval of a product candidate may be conditioned upon certain limitations and restrictions as to the drug s use  or upon the conduct of further studies  and is subject to continuous review 
the fda may also require us to conduct additional post approval studies 
these post approval studies may include carcinogenicity studies in animals or further human clinical trials 
the later discovery of previously unknown problems with the product  manufacturer or manufacturing facility may result in criminal prosecution  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  or total or partial suspension of production  as well as other regulatory action against our product candidates or us 
if approvals are withdrawn for a product  or if a product is seized or recalled  we would be unable to sell that product and our revenues would suffer 
we and our contract manufacturers are required to comply with the applicable fda current good manufacturing practices regulations  which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance  as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
further  manufacturing facilities must be approved by the fda before they can be used to manufacture our product candidates  and are subject to additional fda inspection 
we  or our third party manufacturers  may not be able to comply with cgmp regulations or other fda regulatory requirements  resulting in a delay or an inability to manufacture the products 
labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and state regulatory agencies and  in some circumstances  the federal trade commission 
fda enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of approved products for unapproved  or off label  uses 
these regulations and the fda s interpretation of them may impair our ability to effectively market products for which we gain approval 
failure to comply with these requirements can result in regulatory enforcement action by the fda 
further  we may not obtain the labeling claims we believe are necessary or desirable for the promotion of our product candidates 
we need to conduct preclinical  toxicology  genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies and clinical trials of all of our product candidates 
any unanticipated costs or delays in these studies or trials  or the need to conduct additional studies or trials  could reduce our revenues and profitability 
generally  we must demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates before approval to market can be obtained from the fda 
our product candidates are in various stages of clinical development 
depending upon the stage at which a product candidate is in the development process  we will need to complete preclinical  toxicology  genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies  as well as clinical trials  on these product candidates before we submit marketing applications in the united states and abroad 
these studies and trials can be very costly and time consuming 
in addition  we rely on third parties to perform significant aspects of our studies and clinical trials  introducing additional sources of risk into our development programs 
results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials involving large scale testing of patients in comparison to control groups 
the completion of clinical trials depends upon many factors  including the rate of enrollment of patients 
if we are unable to recruit sufficient clinical patients during the appropriate period  we may need to delay our clinical trials and incur significant additional costs 
in addition  the fda or institutional review boards may require us to conduct additional trials or delay  restrict or discontinue our clinical trials on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
even though we have completed all planned phase pivotal clinical trials for mt and even if we complete our current clinical trials for mt and our other product candidates  we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials and studies to support our nda to the fda 
once submitted  an nda would require fda approval before we could distribute or commercialize the product described in the application 
even if we determine that data from our clinical trials  toxicology  genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies are positive  we cannot assure you that the fda  after completing its analysis  will not determine that the trials or studies should have been conducted or analyzed differently  and thus reach a different conclusion from that reached by us  or request that further trials  studies or analyses be conducted 
for example  the fda may require data in certain subpopulations  such as pediatric use  or may require long term carcinogenicity studies  prior to nda approval  unless we can obtain a waiver to delay such studies 
our costs associated with our human clinical trials vary based on a number of factors  including 
the order and timing of clinical indications pursued  
the extent of development and financial support from collaborative parties  if any  
the need to conduct additional clinical trials or studies  
the number of patients required for enrollment  
the difficulty of obtaining sufficient patient populations and clinicians  
the difficulty of obtaining clinical supplies of our product candidates  and 
governmental and regulatory delays 
even if we obtain positive preclinical or clinical study results initially  future clinical trial results may not be similarly positive 
we depend on collaborations with third parties  which may reduce our product revenues or restrict our ability to commercialize products 
our ability to develop  manufacture  commercialize and obtain regulatory approval of our existing and any future product candidates depends upon our ability to enter into and maintain contractual and collaborative arrangements with others 
we have and intend in the future to retain contract manufacturers and clinical trial investigators 
in addition  the identification of new compounds or product candidates for development may require us to enter into licensing or other collaborative agreements with others  including pharmaceutical companies and research institutions 
we currently intend to market and commercialize our products through others  which will require us to enter into sales  marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties 
these arrangements may reduce our product revenues 
our third party contractual or collaborative arrangements may require us to grant rights  including marketing rights  to one or more parties 
these arrangements may also contain covenants restricting our product development or business efforts in the future  or other terms that are burdensome to us  and may involve the acquisition of our equity securities 
collaborative agreements for the acquisition of new compounds or product candidates may require us to pay license fees  make milestone payments and or pay royalties 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain our existing or future collaborative or contractual arrangements  or that we will be able to enter into future arrangements with third parties on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we fail to maintain our existing arrangements or to establish new arrangements when and as necessary  we could be required to undertake these activities at our own expense  which would significantly increase our capital requirements and may delay the development  manufacture and commercialization of our product candidates 
we are subject to a number of risks associated with our dependence on contractual and collaborative arrangements with others 
we may not have day to day control over the activities of our contractors or collaborators 

third parties may not fulfill their obligations to us 

we may not realize the contemplated or expected benefits from collaborative or other arrangements 

business combinations and changes in the contractual or collaborative party s business strategy may adversely affect its willingness or ability to complete its obligations to us 

the contractor or collaborative party may have the right to terminate its arrangements with us on limited or no notice and for reasons outside of our control 

the contractual or collaborative party may develop or have rights to competing products or product candidates and withdraw support or cease to perform work on our products 

disagreements may arise regarding breach of the arrangement  ownership of proprietary rights  clinical results or regulatory approvals 
these factors could lead to delays in the development or commercialization of our product candidates  and disagreements with our contractors or collaborators could require or result in litigation or arbitration  which would be time consuming and expensive 
our ultimate success may depend upon the success and performance on the part of these third parties 
if we fail to maintain these relationships or establish new relationships as required  development and commercialization of our product candidates will be delayed 
we currently depend and will in the future depend on third parties to manufacture our product candidates 
if these manufacturers fail to meet our requirements or any regulatory requirements  the product development and commercialization of our product candidates will be delayed 
we do not have  and have no plans to develop  the internal capability to manufacture either clinical trial or commercial quantities of products that we may develop or are under development 
we rely upon third party manufacturers to supply us with our product candidates 
we also need supply contracts to sell our products commercially 
there is no guarantee that manufacturers that enter into commercial supply contracts with us will be financially viable entities going forward 
if we do not have the necessary commercial supply contracts  or if our current manufacturer is unable to satisfy our requirements or meet any regulatory requirements  and we are required to find an alternative source of supply  there may be additional costs and delays in product development and commercialization of our product candidates or we may be required to comply with additional regulatory requirements 
if we are unable to build sales  marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions  we will not be able to commercialize any of our drug candidates 
we currently intend to enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell any of our product candidates approved by the fda for commercial sale 
we may not be able to enter into marketing and sales agreements with others on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
to the extent that we enter into marketing and sales agreements with others  our revenues  if any  will be affected by the sales and marketing efforts of others 
we may also retain the right  where possible  to co promote our products in conjunction with our collaborative parties 
if we are unable to enter into third party sales and marketing agreements  or if we are exercising our rights to co promote a product  then we will be required to develop internal marketing and sales capabilities 
we may not successfully establish marketing and sales capabilities or have sufficient resources to do so 
if our competitors develop and commercialize products faster than we do or if their products are superior to ours  our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated 
our product candidates will have to compete with existing and any newly developed migraine therapies 
there are also likely to be numerous competitors developing new products to treat migraine and the other diseases and conditions for which we may seek to develop products in the future  which could render our product candidates or technologies obsolete or non competitive 
our primary competitors will likely include large pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  universities and public and private research institutions 
we face  and will continue to face  intense competition from other companies for securing collaborations with pharmaceutical companies  establishing relationships with academic and research institutions  and acquiring licenses to proprietary technology 
these competitors  either alone or with collaborative parties  may succeed with technologies or products that are more effective than any of our current or future technologies or products 
many of our actual or potential competitors  either alone or together with collaborative parties  have substantially greater financial resources  and almost all of our competitors have larger numbers of scientific and administrative personnel than we do 
many of these competitors  either alone or together with their collaborative parties  also have significantly greater experience than we do in 
developing product candidates  
undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials  
obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals of product candidates  and 
manufacturing and marketing products 
accordingly  our actual or potential competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection  receiving fda approval or commercializing products before we do 
our competitors may also develop products or technologies that are superior to those that we are developing  and render our product candidates or technologies obsolete or non competitive 
if we cannot successfully compete with new or existing products  our marketing and sales will suffer and we may not ever be profitable 
if we are unable to protect our patents or proprietary rights  or if we are unable to operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of others  we may be unable to develop our product candidates or compete effectively 
the pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies  products and processes 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability  and the ability of our licensors  to obtain and to keep protection for our products and technologies under the patent laws of the united states and other countries  so that we can stop others from using our inventions 
our success also will depend on our ability to prevent others from using our trade secrets 
in addition  we must operate in a way that does not infringe  or violate  the patent  trade secret and other intellectual property rights of other parties 
we cannot know how much protection  if any  our patents will provide or whether our patent applications will issue as patents 
the breadth of claims that will be allowed in patent applications cannot be predicted and neither the validity nor enforceability of claims in issued patents can be assured 
if  for any reason  we are unable to obtain and enforce valid claims covering our products and technology  we may be unable to prevent competitors from using the same or similar technology or to prevent competitors from marketing identical products 
in addition  due to the extensive time needed to develop and test our products  any patents that we obtain may expire in a short time after commercialization 
this would reduce or eliminate any advantages that such patents may give us 
we may need to license rights to third party patents and intellectual property to continue the development and marketing of our product candidates 
if we are unable to acquire such rights on acceptable terms  our development activities may be blocked and we may be unable to bring our product candidates to market 
we may enter into litigation to defend ourselves against claims of infringement  assert claims that a third party is infringing one or more of our patents  protect our trade secrets or know how  or determine the scope and validity of other s patent or proprietary rights 
as a result of such litigation  our patent claims may be found to be invalid  unenforceable or not of sufficient scope to cover the activities of an alleged infringer 
if we are found to infringe the patent rights of others  then we may be forced to pay damages sufficient to irreparably harm the company and or be prevented from continuing our product development and marketing activities 
regardless of its eventual outcome  any lawsuit that we enter into may consume time and resources that will impair our ability to develop and market our product candidates 
we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators 
however  these parties may not honor these agreements and  as a result  we may not be able to protect our rights to unpatented trade secrets and know how 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know how 
also  many of our scientific and management personnel were previously employed by competing companies 
as a result  such companies may allege trade secret violations and similar claims against us 
if we fail to acquire  develop and commercialize additional products or product candidates  or fail to successfully promote or market approved products  we may never achieve profitability 
as part of our business strategy  we plan to identify and acquire product candidates or approved products in areas in which we possess particular knowledge 
because we do not directly engage in basic research or drug discovery  we must rely upon third parties to sell or license product opportunities to us 
other companies  including some with substantially greater financial  marketing and sales resources  are competing with us to acquire such products 
we may not be able to acquire rights to additional products on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  we may acquire new products with different marketing strategies  distribution channels and bases of competition than those of our current products 
therefore  we may not be able to compete favorably in those product categories 
any of our future products  including mt  may not be accepted by the market  which would limit the commercial opportunities for our products 
even if our product candidates perform successfully in clinical trials and are approved by the fda and other regulatory authorities  our future products  including mt  may not achieve market acceptance and may not generate the revenues that we anticipate 
the degree of market acceptance will depend upon a number of factors  including 
the receipt and timing of regulatory approvals  
the availability of third party reimbursement  
the indications for which the product is approved  
the rate of adoption by health care providers  
the rate of product acceptance by target patient populations  
the price of the product relative to alternative therapies  
the availability of alternative therapies  
the extent of marketing efforts by us and third party distributors and agents  
the publicity regarding our products or similar products  and 
the extent and severity of side effects as compared to alternative therapies 
if we do not receive adequate third party reimbursements for any of our future products  our revenues and profitability will be reduced 
our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully will depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of such products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities  such as medicare and medicaid in the united states  private health insurers and other organizations 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of a newly approved health care product  particularly for indications for which there is no current effective treatment or for which medical care is typically not sought 
adequate third party coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product research and development 
if adequate coverage and reimbursement levels are not provided by government and third party payors for use of our products  our products may fail to achieve market acceptance 
our future revenues  profitability and access to capital will be affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and private third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means 
we expect that a number of federal  state and foreign proposals will seek to control the cost of drugs through governmental regulation 
we are unsure of the form that any health care reform legislation may take or what actions federal  state  foreign and private payors may take in response to the proposed reforms 
therefore  we cannot predict the effect of any implemented reform on our business 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us  we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates 
the testing and marketing of pharmaceutical products entails an inherent risk of product liability 
product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers  health care providers  pharmaceutical companies or others selling our future products 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against such claims  we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit the commercialization of our product candidates 
we have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage only for our human clinical trials 
however  insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive  and no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability 
we may not be able to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing 
if a plaintiff brings a successful product liability claim against us in excess of our insurance coverage  if any  we may incur substantial liabilities and our business may fail 
we may need substantial additional funding and may not have access to capital 
if we are unable to raise capital when needed  we may need to delay  reduce or eliminate our product development or commercialization efforts 
we may need to raise additional funds to execute our business strategy 
we have incurred losses from operations since inception and we expect to incur additional operating losses 
in particular  we believe that we will require additional capital to fund the acquisition of new product candidates 
our actual capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including 
the progress of our research and development programs  
the progress of preclinical studies  clinical and other testing  
the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  
the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  
the effect of competing technological and market developments  
the effect of changes and developments in our collaborative  licensing and other relationships  and 
the terms and timing of any new collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish 
we may be unable to raise sufficient funds to execute our business strategy 
in addition  we may not be able to find sufficient debt or equity funding on acceptable terms 
if we cannot  we may need to delay  reduce or eliminate research and development programs 
the sale by us of additional equity securities or the expectation that we will sell additional equity securities may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
in addition  collaborative arrangements may require us to grant product development programs or licenses to third parties for products that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel  which would harm our research and development efforts 
we are highly dependent on the efforts of our key management and scientific personnel  especially john r 
plachetka  pharmd  our chairman  president and chief executive officer 
dr 
plachetka signed an employment agreement with us on april   as amended and restated on july   for a three year term with automatic one year renewal terms 
as of july   we also have entered into employment agreements with four of our other key management personnel  each of which provides for a two year term with automatic one year renewal terms 
if we lose the services of dr 
plachetka or the services of any of our other key personnel  or fail to recruit key scientific personnel  we may be unable to achieve our business objectives 
there is intense competition for qualified scientific personnel 
since our business is very science oriented  we need to continue to attract and retain such people 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for developing our business 
furthermore  our future success will also depend in part on the continued service of our other key management personnel 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our proceeds from our initial public offering and private placements have been invested in money market funds that invest primarily in short term  highly rated investments  including us government securities  commercial paper and certificates of deposit guaranteed by banks 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a decrease in market rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio 
declines in interest rates will  however  reduce our interest income while increases in interest rates will increase our interest income
