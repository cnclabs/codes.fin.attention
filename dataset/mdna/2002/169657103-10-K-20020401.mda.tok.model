item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations covers in part periods prior to the completion of our recapitalization in august and prior to our initial public offering in august as part of our recapitalization  we entered into financing arrangements and  as a result  we have a different capital structure 
as a result of the initial public offering  we again significantly changed our capitalization 
accordingly  the results of operations for periods subsequent to the recapitalization and initial public offering are not necessarily comparable to prior periods 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report 
overview in  we were incorporated as a distinct entity and established as the parent of a stand alone worldwide business 
prior to this time  we operated as a separate division of hyundai electronics  now hynix semiconductor  one of the world s largest semiconductor manufacturers and a member of the hyundai group  the south korean conglomerate 
in  as part of a recapitalization  a group of equity investors along with management obtained control of chippac 
this transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization 
our revenue consists of fees charged to our customers for packaging  testing  and distribution of their integrated circuits 
from to  revenue increased from million to million  a cumulative annual growth rate of  primarily from the growth of substrate  or bga packaging  and  in  from the growth of test revenue and the acquisition of our malaysian business 
the semiconductor industry is however inherently volatile  with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns 
these downturns have been characterized by  among other things  diminished product demand  excess production capacity and accelerated erosion of selling prices 
the semiconductor industry is presently recovering from the worst downturn in its history 
we expect conditions to improve in due to the severity of this downturn for the semiconductor industry and for our customers  we have also experienced the first decline in revenue on a year over year basis in our history 
this in turn has had a significant impact on our operating results 
our revenue for the year ended december  declined to million or by compared to the year ended december  the semiconductor industry has historically experienced volatility  with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns 
these downturns have been characterized by  among other things  diminished product demand  excess production capacity and accelerated erosion of selling prices 
the semiconductor industry is presently recovering from a downturn  and we expect conditions to improve in based on current general economic and semiconductor market expectations  we believe it is likely we could achieve revenue growth in as compared to this growth assumes a replenishment of inventory in the electronics supply chain  gradual recovery in our end markets and ramp up of new customers acquired in based on these assumptions  we believe gross margins could increase to approximately to  in the second half of as compared to approximately for the second half of and that operating income could be approximately of revenue in the second half of based on these estimates  we expect to be profitable on a quarterly basis by the end of if our current assumptions and estimates are correct  operating expenses selling  general  administrative  and research and development expenses are expected to be approximately of revenue for management is constantly re evaluating estimates and the expectations above could and probably will change as the year unfolds

revenue was million in the year ended december   a decrease of from the year ended december  the decline in revenue is a result of lower end market demand for our customers products 
this decrease was realized across all the end markets we serve and was not significantly concentrated in any one end market 
we believe that our customers purchased product for their inventory in amounts consistent with historical demand 
thus  as end user demand dropped  our customers inventories increased  thereby decreasing demand for our products 
gross profit 
gross profit during the year ended december  was million  a decrease of from the year ended december  the majority of the decrease was caused by lower demand leading to lower equipment utilization as well as lower average selling prices in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  equipment utilization was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
although reductions in force  furloughs  plant shutdown days and other cost saving methods were used in the year ended december   they were insufficient to offset the decline in revenue 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were million in the year ended december   a decrease of from the year ended december  expenses declined compared to  because we implemented strict cost controls in reaction to the decline in revenue and because of the reductions in force we implemented in the first quarter of in addition  we incurred staffing expenses in the second half of related to our initial public offering that did not occur in research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  in the year ended december  our research and development expenses in represent an increase from similar expenses in the increases were mainly due to expenses related to power packaging technology  new processes development and flip chip technology development 
restructuring  write down of impaired assets and other charges 
during the year ended december   the company wrote down impaired assets by million 
the asset write down relates primarily to the company s manufacturing assets in the assembly and test facilities in south korea and malaysia 
the company determined that due to excess capacity the future expected cash flows related to equipment for certain niche package types will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the manufacturing equipment for those package types in the facility 
the carrying values of these assets were written down to the estimated fair market value and will continue to be depreciated over the remaining useful lives 
there were no equivalent write offs in the year ended december  in addition  we recorded expenses associated with reduction in force and furlough costs of million and a loss reserve of million on executive officers loans forgiveness in  that occurred in the year ended december  with no comparable costs in interest expense 
total outstanding interest bearing debt increased to million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in debt was primarily due to draw down of our revolving credit line for general corporate purposes and issuance of million of convertible debt and million of additional high yield borrow in june related interest expense was million for the year ended december   a decrease of compared to the year ended december  the reduction in interest expense was primarily due to reduced interest rates on our debt 
foreign currency gains 
net foreign currency gains were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these non cash gains are primarily due to the fluctuations between the exchange rate of the united states dollar and the south korean won related to long term pension benefits payable to our south korean employees 
other income and expenses 
other income and expenses  net  was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other expenses for december  includes the one time payment of million  paid to bain capital and sxi group in exchange for the termination of two advisory agreements  which were entered into during our recapitalization in there were no equivalent expenditures related to this one time payment in the year ended december  accretion of dividends and recorded value of the intel warrant 
accretion of dividends on preferred stock and the recorded value of the intel warrant was in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  all preferred stock was redeemed or converted to non dividend bearing class a common stock concurrent with our initial public offering in august the intel warrant expired unexercised in february income taxes 
income tax expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  for an effective tax rates of approximately in and in concurrently with our recapitalization on august   the company was reorganized and as a result now has operations and earnings in jurisdictions with relatively low income tax rates  or where we enjoy tax holidays or other similar tax benefits 
net loss income available to common stockholders 
as a result of the items above  net loss available to common stockholders increased to million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue in increased to million from million in we experienced strong increases across all product lines 
laminate sales increased over leaded sales  not including those attributable to our acquisition of the malaysian business  increased over and test revenue increased over increases in revenue were broadly distributed across all of our end markets  but the communications segment showed an increase of 
during the last six months of  the malaysian business contributed million in revenue 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in  resulting in a gross margin of compared to in effective january  we re evaluated the estimated useful lives of our property  plant and equipment 
based on our internal assessment of historical experience  a third party appraisal  and future expectations of the useful lives of our property  plant and equipment  the useful lives were changed from five years to eight years 
the net book values of assembly and test product equipment and furniture and fixtures already in use are now being depreciated over the remaining useful life  based on eight years from the date the assets were originally placed in service 
this change resulted in depreciation expense for the year ended december  being million lower than we would have recorded if we had continued to use five year lives 
the remaining increase in gross profit was attributable to improved materials procurement and greater efficiency due to high utilization rates partially offset by an increase in average labor costs  the effect of the malaysian business acquisition  and the strengthening of the south korean won against the us dollar in versus the prior year 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  these expenses increased to from 
in we hired new personnel at the management level to accommodate both our expanded operations and our transition to a public company 
as a result  we incurred additional expenses associated with hiring in the areas of administration  sales  and marketing 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  these expenses decreased to from 
the decrease  as a percentage of revenue  was mainly caused by the additional revenue from the malaysia business that did not require as high research and development expenditures in as the required intellectual property and process technology for the malaysian business was acquired in the purchase 
restructuring and other charges 
as a result of our recapitalization  we were contractually required to make a one time change of control payment to our unionized south korean employees of approximately million 
the payment was recorded as an operating expense during the year ended december  this expense did not reoccur in interest income 
interest income decreased to million in compared to million in the average cash balance maintained in was significantly lower than in due to the working capital and fixed asset investments needed to support our growth 
interest expense 
interest expense for increased to million in from million in this is primarily due to months of interest expense on the debt incurred as part of the recapitalization compared to five months of interest payments in in addition  we incurred interest expense on the debt incurred to complete the malaysian acquisition 
foreign currency gains 
the foreign currency gain was million in compared to million in the prior year period 
the exposure to foreign currency gains and losses has been significantly mitigated by two related factors 
first  we negotiated with the large majority of our material and equipment suppliers to denominate purchase transactions in us dollars 
second  on october   we changed our functional currency to the us dollar from the local currencies of the south korean and chinese subsidiaries 
other income expense 
other expense increased million in compared to other income of million in this was primarily due to the one time charge of million to end the management services agreements with bain capital and sxi group 
income taxes 
income tax expense was million in compared to million in our effective tax rate was in compared to in our effective tax rate during was adversely affected by losses of the operations in china  for which no tax benefit was realized 
the recapitalization also changed the tax structure and overall effective tax rate compared to extraordinary loss 
we incurred an extraordinary loss of million and million  net of tax benefit  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the extraordinary loss was related to the early repayment of our senior term debt that was used in the acquisition of intersil s malaysian business that was subsequently repaid using proceeds from our initial public offering 
in  the extraordinary loss was related to the early retirement of debt upon the recapitalization of our company 
net income 
as a result of the items described above  our net income increased to million in compared to a net loss of million in critical accounting policies we believe the following accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our significant judgments 
we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in fixed assets  intellectual property and related intangible assets 
management evaluates the valuation of these assets every quarter paying special attention to events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that their carrying amount might not be recoverable 
we determine whether or not the assets are recoverable based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the assets and if not  we calculate the amount of the impairment charge based on estimated discounted future cash flows to be generated by the assets or appraised fair value 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail rather than those used in estimating future cash flows  significantly different determination of recoverability or of fair value for these assets and results of operations could be reported 
we recorded an asset impairment charge of million for the year ended december  in addition  management uses judgment when setting expected asset useful lives for long lived assets 
the asset useful lives used are based on historical experience and future expectations 
however  business conditions or underlying technology may change in the future which could cause a change in asset lives 
any change in lives would cause a significant change in depreciation and amortization 
after the recapitalization see note to the consolidated financial statements  we reassessed the asset useful lives for our long lived assets in and changed the useful lives from five years to eight years 
this change resulted in depreciation expense for the year ended december  being million lower than would have been recorded using five year lives 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  price protection  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
furthermore  if anticipated volume levels turn out to be different  this would impact reductions to revenue and accrued customer rebates 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions less costs to dispose 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in the year ended december   we increased the valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount  we believe  is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
liquidity and capital resources our ongoing primary cash needs are for operations and equipment purchases 
we spent million on capital expenditures during the year ended december  compared to million in capital expenditures during the year ended december  we anticipate spending million in capital expenditures in  not including any buy out of operating leases  which we expect will not exceed million in we no longer have the ability to borrow additional funds under the million capital expenditure line portion of our senior credit facilities  which expired on july  outstanding borrowing on the capital expenditure line at december  was million and bore a weighted average interest rate of in under the terms of the agreement relating to our acquisition of the malaysian business  during the period from june  to june   intersil is entitled to receive additional contingent incentive payments based upon the achievement of milestones relating to the transfer of business previously subcontracted by intersil to a third party 
in the event that intersil were to achieve all the milestones  we would pay intersil an additional sum of approximately million in the aggregate 
as of december   we have cumulatively paid intersil million under this arrangement 
in june  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes and million of senior subordinated notes in a private placement 
a majority of these funds were used to pay down our term loans and revolving loans under the senior credit facility 
the million of convertible subordinated notes are convertible into shares of our class a common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment at any time prior to june  and bear an interest rate of per annum 
the million of senior subordinated notes bear an interest rate of per annum and mature on august  as of december   our total debt consisted of million of borrowings  which was comprised of million of revolving loans  which fully utilized the borrowing capacity under our revolving loans  million in term loans  million of senior subordinated notes and million of convertible subordinated notes 
the revolving credit line under our senior credit facilities matures on july   and had a weighted average interest rate of in the term loans mature on july   have amortization payments due each quarter and had a weighted average interest rate of in our total potential commitments on our loans  operating leases  intersil incentive payments  royalty and license agreements as of december   were as follows in thousands within total year years years after years on balance sheet commitments senior credit facilities     senior subordinated notes   convertible subordinated notes   total on balance sheet commitments      off balance sheet commitments operating leases      royalty licensing agreements   restructuring  net   contingent payments to intersil relating to purchase of malaysian business    total off balance sheet commitments      total commitments      our senior credit facilities require that we meet specified financial tests  including  without limitation  a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum interest coverage ratio  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a maximum senior leverage ratio and  for only  a minimum consolidated adjusted ebitda amount 
in conjunction with our million private placement in june  the lenders of our senior credit facilities amended the financial tests for the period july  through december  our senior credit facilities also contain covenants restricting our operations 
there were no violations of these covenants through december  amended as follows 
on december   these covenants were waived for and three new covenants were established for a requirement to raise at least million in junior capital by march   which was fulfilled by us through an underwritten public offering of our class a common stock  which was completed in january  a minimum ebitda requirement based on a rolling months ending march   june   september  and december   of million  million  million and million  respectively  and a capital expenditures limit of million in with an exemption for a buyout of existing operating leases 
in january we issued million shares of our class a common stock in an underwritten public offering 
not only did this offering meet the requirements of our debt instruments but the net proceeds of the offering also allowed us to pay off the entire amount outstanding under our revolving loans and a portion of the principal amount of our term loans 
see a further discussion of this offering and the use of proceeds from it below under subsequent common stock offering 
the weakness in demand in for packaging and test services has adversely affected our cash flows from operations 
we believe that our existing cash balances  cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our senior credit facilities provide sufficient cash resources to meet our projected operating and other cash requirements for the next twelve months 
an event of default under any debt instrument  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
we may require capital sooner than currently expected 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available when we need it or  if available  that it will be available on satisfactory terms 
in addition  the terms of our senior credit facilities and senior subordinated notes significantly reduce our ability to incur additional debt 
failure to obtain any such required additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our company 
other than the covenants on the debt as discussed above  we have no performance guarantees or unconsolidated entities 
our off balance sheets commitments are limited to equipment operating leases  leases on office and manufacturing space and additional contingent incentive payments to intersil 
our total off balance obligations are approximately million 
in   and cash used in provided by operations was million  million  and million  respectively 
cash from operations mainly consisted of net loss income plus depreciation and amortization less utilization for working capital 
in   and cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million  respectively 
in and  cash used in investing activities mainly was invested in property and equipment 
in  in addition to the acquisition of property and equipment  cash was invested in the purchase of the malaysian business  including purchased intellectual property 
in   and  cash provided by used in financing activities was million  million  and million  respectively 
cash was mainly provided by or used in debt issuance  debt prepayment  stock issuance  and stock redemption 
derivative financial instruments in  we entered into foreign forward contracts to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on the cost of materials and equipment 
the contracts entered into required the purchase of south korean won or japanese yen and the delivery of us dollars  and generally had maturities which did not exceed three months 
because the contracts entered into did not qualify as hedges under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  the gains and losses from the contracts were recorded as foreign currency gains and losses 
we had a net loss of million in arising from forward foreign currency contracts 
we had no gain or loss in and as of december   we had no foreign currency contracts outstanding 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the use of the pooling of interest method of accounting is no longer allowed 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and other intangible assets will no longer be amortized but shall be reviewed and tested annually for impairment 
sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and early adoption is permitted for companies with a fiscal year beginning after march  we expect that the adoption of sfas no 
and on january   will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provision of accounting principles board apb no 
 reporting the results of operations  reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets including amortizable intangibles and is effective for fiscal years beginning december  as well as interim periods within those fiscal years 
sfas no 
does not apply to the impairment of goodwill and non amortizable intangibles 
we are currently reviewing this statement to determine its effect on our financial position and results of operations 
acquisition of malaysian business on june   we consummated our acquisition of intersil s packaging and test operations located in kuala lumpur  malaysia along with related intellectual property for approximately million in cash and preferred stock 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into a five year supply agreement with intersil to provide intersil assembly and test services on an exclusive basis 
the malaysian business increases opportunities in high growth advanced communications products  provides a presence in malaysia near emerging wafer foundries  broadens our package portfolio and enhances our intellectual property in key areas 
in addition  the malaysian business expands our mixed signal testing capabilities and provides us with critical expertise in rf testing 
we accounted for the malaysian acquisition using purchase accounting 
under purchase accounting  the total purchase price of the malaysian business is allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values as of the closing date of the acquisition 
the purchase price of million represents the total of the cash consideration including direct costs of the acquisition and the estimated fair value of the class c preferred stock exchanged for the whole of the issued shares of the malaysian business and certain intellectual property associated with it 
the terms of the acquisition of the malaysian business require us to pay until june  additional contingent incentive payments to intersil based on the achievement of milestones with respect to the transfer of the seller s packaging business  currently subcontracted by intersil to third parties  to us 
we will record these contingent payments as additional purchase price if and when they are earned and paid on a quarterly basis 
in the event that intersil were to achieve all the milestones  we would pay intersil an additional sum of approximately million in the aggregate 
for the years ended december  and  we have paid million and million  respectively  for a cumulative total of million 
these payments increased the effective purchase price and were allocated to non current assets 
additionally  million of other purchase price adjustments were recorded based on the difference between the final closing balance sheet and the estimated closing balance sheet of the malaysian business and deferred tax of million on the total of these purchase price adjustments 
this resulted in a further increase in non current assets 
the amount and components of the purchase price along with the allocation of the purchase price to assets purchased and liabilities assumed as of december  were as follows in millions purchase price cash consideration estimated fair value of class c preferred stock deferred taxes expenses less payment due from intersil allocation of purchase price land and buildings plant and equipment intellectual property restructuring accrual deferred taxes net other assets and liabilities there is no goodwill arising from the acquisition of the malaysian business 
the fair value of total assets and liabilities exceeded the purchase price by million 
this amount has been allocated in full to non current assets as summarized below excess of estimated fair value over fair purchase price adjusted non current asset value allocated fair value in millions land and buildings plant and equipment intellectual property intellectual property we acquired along with the malaysian business primarily consists of trade secrets and patents 
the estimated average useful life of these assets is between five and nine years 
an accrual of million was established for expected costs of restructuring the malaysian business 
as of december  and  million and million of these one time non recurring costs have been incurred in connection with our factory reorganization  product discontinuance and employee related costs 
as of december   a total of million remains for completion of the purchase activities 
we began formulating exit plans and termination data during our due diligence relating to the acquisition of the malaysian business 
the accrual was originally comprised of million for involuntary termination benefits and million of other exit activities 
actual involuntary termination benefits and other exit costs amounted to million and million  respectively 
the projected number of planned reductions in head count as a result of this planned restructuring was employees  with an actual reduction of employees 
all restructuring activities were completed in the year ended december   and there are no unresolved contingencies or purchase price allocation issues 
the results of operations of the malaysian business have been included with our results of operations for periods subsequent to june  set forth below is the unaudited pro forma combined summary of operations of our company for the years ended december  and  as if the acquisition had been made on january  in thousands  except for per share amounts 
pro forma disclosure december  unaudited unaudited net sales   income before extraordinary item   net income   earnings per share basic diluted shares used in per share calculation basic   diluted   subsequent common stock offering on january   we sold  shares of class a common stock in an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of per share 
in connection with this sale  we received net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and estimated offering expenses 
we used the net proceeds of the million from this offering to pay down term loans and revolving loans  respectively 
the term loans had a weighted average interest rate of for the year ended december   have scheduled amortization payments each quarter and mature on july  the revolving loans had a weighted average interest rate of for the year ended december  and mature on july  on february   we sold an additional  shares of class a common stock in conjunction with the underwriter s exercise of their over allotment option at the public offering price of per share 
in connection with this sale  we received net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses 
we used million of the net proceeds from the sale of the additional shares sold on february  to further pay down term loans 
as of february   our term loans had a remaining balance of approximately million and our revolving loans had been repaid in its entirety 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we have no derivative financial instruments 
we have long term debt that carries fixed and variable interest rates 
a fluctuation in interest rates of would increase our annual interest charge by approximately million 
the exposure to foreign currency gains and losses has been significantly mitigated by two related factors 
first  we negotiated with the large majority of our material and equipment suppliers to denominate purchase transactions in us dollars 
second  on october   we changed our functional currency to the us dollar from the local currencies of our south korean and chinese subsidiaries 
for the years ended december   and  we generated approximately   and of total revenue  respectively  from international markets  primarily from customers in south korea 
in addition  all of the facilities currently used to provide packaging services are located in china  malaysia and south korea 
moreover  many of our customers operations are located in countries outside of the united states of america 
we cannot determine if our future operations and earnings will be affected by new laws  new regulations  a volatile political climate  changes in or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations or other consequences of doing business outside the united states of america particularly in china  malaysia and south korea 
if future operations are negatively affected by these changes  sales or profits may suffer 
investment risk all of our investments are at fixed rates  therefore  the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of investments is minimal as all of our investments mature within one year 
foreign currency risk based on the our overall currency rate exposure at december   a near term appreciation or depreciation in the value of the us dollar would have an insignificant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year 
there can be no assurance  however  that there will not be a material impact further in the future 
a portion of our costs is denominated in foreign currencies like the chinese renminbi  the malaysian ringgit and the south korean won 
as a result  changes in the exchange rates of these currencies or any other applicable currencies to the us dollar will affect the cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses 
we cannot fully predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our profitability 
from time to time  we may have engaged in  and may continue to engage in  exchange rate hedging activities in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
however  we cannot assure that any hedging technique we implement will be effective 
if it is not effective  we may experience reduced operating margins
