item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the company  which are included elsewhere herein 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and costs and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those relating to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  property and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
on december   the securities and exchange commission sec requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting policies in md a 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial position and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company believes that the following accounting policies fit this definition revenue recognition for premier club initiation fees revenue from premier club initial membership fees originated after december  is deferred and recognized ratably over the average expected life of the memberships  which has been estimated to be eight years 
the average estimated life is based on management s best estimate using company specific historical information 
the company has not changed the estimated life used to recognize the premier club membership initiation fees since adoption in january when premier club membership initiation fees became nonrefundable  but would revise such estimate if  in management s opinion  changing trends in membership experience warrant such a change 
intangible assets intangible assets consist of goodwill  which represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets of the acquired business 
on july   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets which states  among other things  that goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill that is not subject to amortization will be tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level using a two step impairment assessment 
impairment testing must be performed more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the company tested for potential impairment  both upon adoption of sfas no 
and annually as of july   by determining whether the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
the company had no impairment of goodwill during the year ended june  or at july  accounting for impairment of long lived assets the carrying value of long lived assets is reviewed if the facts and circumstances suggest that it may be impaired 
if this review indicates that long lived assets will not be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flows of the entity over the remaining amortization period  the carrying value of the long lived assets will be 
table of contents reduced by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value 
fair value is determined using management s best estimate of the discounted net operating cash flows over the remaining life of the assets 
property and equipment expenditures for maintenance  repairs and renewals of items that do not extend the service life or increase the capacity of assets are charged to expense as incurred 
significant additions  along with interest incurred during the construction period for expansion at the company s resorts  are capitalized 
interest has been capitalized using the average borrowing rate of the company 
depreciation and amortization has been computed using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives years building and improvements land improvements leasehold improvements furniture  fixtures and equipment business philosophy the company s current business strategy is to focus on internal expansion and development opportunities at its existing resort properties 
however  management continuously evaluates ownership  acquisition and divestiture alternatives with the intention of maximizing shareholder value 
seasonality the resort operations are generally seasonal 
the resorts historically experience greater revenue  costs and profits in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year ended june due to increased occupancy and room rates during the winter months 
historically  approximately   and of annual revenue has been derived during the first  second  third and fourth fiscal quarters  respectively 
events of september  during the three month period following the september  terrorist attacks on new york s world trade center towers and on the pentagon  the company s results of operations were adversely affected by travel disruption and short term cancellation of group bookings at its properties 
the company s resorts experienced an increase in demand during the three months ended march  and june  and management is cautiously optimistic that its lodging fundamentals will continue to advance and operations will continue to approach pre september  levels 
impact of inflation inflation and changing prices have not had a material impact on the company s revenue and results of operations 
based on the current economic climate  the company does not expect that inflation and changing prices will have a material impact on the company s revenue or earnings during the fiscal year 
many of the costs of operating the resorts can be fixed for certain periods of time  reducing the short term effects of changes in the rate of inflation 
room rates  which are set on a daily basis  can be rapidly changed to meet changes in inflation rates as well as other changing market conditions 
the company has less flexibility in changing group rates since guest reservations are typically made to months in advance of the stay 
to the extent inflationary trends affect short term interest rates  a portion of the company s debt service costs may be adversely affected 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere herein

ebitda and adjusted ebitda see below are used by management and certain investors as indicators of the company s historical ability to service debt  to sustain potential future increases in debt and to satisfy capital requirements

working capital current liabilities exceeded current assets by million at june   compared to positive working capital of million at june  the change is primarily because the company used cash to repurchase million principal amount of senior subordinated notes during the year ended june   which would have otherwise matured in april however  the ratio of current liabilities to current assets is not indicative of a lack of liquidity as the company maintains a revolving credit line that represents an additional and immediate potential source of liquidity
