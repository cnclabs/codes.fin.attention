item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release numbers cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies and  commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to impairment of long lived assets  accruals for workers compensation insurance  and contingencies and litigation 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements the company periodically assesses the impairment of long lived assets to be held for use based on expectations of future undiscounted cash flows from the related operations  and when circumstances dictate  adjusts the asset to the extent the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
in september  the company determined that it would close its slurp restaurant and its remaining ladles restaurant due to poor operating performance 
the company recorded an accrual of  at september   representing the present value of the estimated net future lease payments associated with the planned closures of these restaurants 
of this amount   was recorded as accrued liabilities and  was recorded as other long term liabilities 
the company closed the ladles location during the first quarter of fiscal and was successful in terminating the lease agreement for that location during the third quarter of fiscal the company closed the slurp location during the second quarter of fiscal and negotiated a sublease of that location through the end of its lease term during the fourth quarter of fiscal the sublease income is expected to offset all future lease obligations associated with this location 
the company has no future liability related to either location as of september  during fiscal  the company made cash payments to reduce the liabilities for future rent payments of  and reversed the accrual for the remaining balance of  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year all charges and credits described above have been included in the results of operations as facility exit costs 
should the company incur unexpected additional expenses related to the exit of the leases for these locations  additional charges to facility exit costs would be required and would affect the company s results of operations 
the company maintains an accrual for workers compensation and general liability insurance which is recorded in the accrued liabilities section of the balance sheets 
the company determines the adequacy of this accrual by periodically evaluating information periodically provided by its carrier regarding the company s historical experience and trends relating to insurance claims and payments  and industry experience and trends related to insurance claims and payments 
the company also consults with its carrier regarding the carrier s expectation of future trends to determine necessary accruals 
if such information indicates that the accruals are overstated or understated  the company will adjust the assumptions utilized in their methodologies and reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate 
an increase or decrease to this accrual would result in an increase or decrease to the company s employee benefits expense  respectively  which would affect the company s results of operations 
the company is subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of business 
some of these matters include professional liability  employee related matters  and investigations by governmental agencies regarding employment practices 
the company is not currently aware of any such pending or threatened litigation that it believes is reasonably likely to have a material adverse 
table of contents effect on its results of operations 
should the company become aware of such claims it will evaluate the probability of an adverse outcome and provide accruals for such contingencies as necessary

certain operating results and considerations in fiscal  and  the company experienced an increase of   and respectively  in comparable restaurant sales 
the company does not believe it has significant latitude to achieve comparable restaurant sales growth through price increases  and  as a result  the company does not believe that recent comparable restaurant sales are indicative of future trends in such sales 
the company believes that it may from time to time in the future experience declines in comparable restaurant sales  and that any future increases in comparable restaurant sales may be modest 
further  the company s newer restaurants have not historically experienced significant increases in guest volume following their initial opening period

expansion risks the company opened ten salad buffet restaurants in fiscal  seventeen in fiscal  ten in fiscal opening nine new restaurants and re opening one existing restaurant and two new restaurants in fiscal the company currently intends to open two to three restaurants in fiscal but the company may experience difficulty in opening these restaurants for reasons that include  but are not limited to  difficulties in identifying and hiring qualified restaurant managers and staff 
the company s ability to achieve its expansion plans will depend on a variety of factors  many of which may be beyond the company s control  including the company s ability to locate suitable restaurant sites  qualified managers  negotiate acceptable leases or purchase terms  obtain required governmental approvals  construct new restaurants in a timely manner  attract  train and retain qualified and experienced personnel and management  operate its restaurants profitably and obtain additional capital  as well as general economic conditions and the degree of competition in the particular region of expansion 
the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  delays in restaurant openings from time to time 
since its inception  the company has closed three non performing buffet restaurants  one mini restaurant  two ladles restaurants and one slurp restaurant due to poor operating performance 
given the number of restaurants in current operation and the company s projected expansion rate  there can be no assurances that the company will not close restaurants in the future 
any closure could result in a significant write off of assets  which could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company incurs substantial costs in opening a new restaurant and  in the company s experience  new restaurants experience fluctuating operational levels for some time after opening 
in the company s experience  operational expenses tend to stabilize over a period of three to fifteen months after a store opens 
owned restaurants generally require significantly more up front capital than leased restaurants 
as a result  an increase in the percentage of owned restaurant openings as compared to historical practice would increase the capital required to meet the company s growth plans 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully expand into new regions or that the company s existing or new restaurants will be profitable 
the company has encountered intense competition for restaurant sites  and in many cases has had difficulty buying or leasing desirable sites on terms that are acceptable to the company 
in many cases  the company s competitors are willing and able to pay more than the company for sites 
the company expects these difficulties in obtaining desirable sites to continue for the foreseeable future 
see restaurant industry and competition  business expansion strategy and business competition 
restaurant industry and competition the restaurant industry is highly competitive 
key competitive factors in the industry include the quality and value of the food products offered  quality of service  price  dining experience  restaurant location and the 
table of contents ambiance of the facilities 
the company s primary competitors include mid price  full service casual dining restaurants at dinner and fast casual restaurants at lunch 
additionally  the company competes with traditional self service buffet and other soup and salad restaurants and healthful and nutrition oriented restaurants at both meal periods 
the company competes with national and regional chains  as well as individually owned restaurants 
the number of casual restaurants with operations generally similar to the company s has grown substantially in the last several years and the company believes competition among casual restaurants has increased and will continue to increase as the company s competitors expand operations in various geographic areas 
such increased competition could increase the company s operating costs or adversely affect its revenues 
the company believes it competes favorably in the industry  although many of the company s competitors have been in existence longer than the company and have both a more established market presence and substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company  which may give them certain competitive advantages 
in addition  the restaurant industry has few non economic barriers to entry 
therefore  there can be no assurance that third parties will not be able to successfully imitate and implement the company s concept

capital requirements in addition to funds generated from operations  the company will need to obtain external financing in the form of sale lease backs of owned properties and long term debt financing to complete its plans for expansion through new restaurants and improvements to existing restaurants for fiscal year and beyond and meet principal payments on its existing loans

additionally  should the company s results of operations decrease it may not have the ability to pay its debt of million outstanding at september  cost sensitivity the company s profitability is highly sensitive to increases in food  labor  utilities  insurance costs  and other operating costs 
the company s dependence on frequent deliveries of fresh produce and groceries subjects it to the risk that shortages or interruptions in supply caused by adverse weather or other conditions could materially adversely affect the availability  quality and cost of ingredients 
in addition  unfavorable trends or developments concerning factors such as inflation  increasing food  labor and employee benefit costs including increases in hourly wage and minimum unemployment tax rates  rent increases resulting from the rent escalation provisions in the company s leases  and the availability of experienced management and hourly employees may also adversely affect the company 
the company believes recent relatively favorable inflation rates and part time labor supplies in its principal market area have contributed to relatively stable food and labor costs in recent years 
both insurance and energy costs have increased at a much higher than historical rates in the company s core market california and other regions 
however  there can be no assurance that these conditions will continue or that the company will have the ability to control costs in the future

there can be no assurance that the increases in repair and maintenance expense and increased property insurance expense will not continue to impact the company s profitability or its ability to control costs in the future
