actual results may vary depending on the company s results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses gateway s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgements  including those related to customer incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  restructuring costs  retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
gateway records estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive offerings 
should a greater proportion of customers redeem incentives than estimated by the company  additional reductions to revenue may be required 
gateway maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of gateway s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
gateway provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while gateway engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  gateway s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from gateway s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
gateway writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
gateway holds minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within or adjacent to its strategic focus  some of which are in publicly traded companies whose share prices are highly volatile and some of which are in non publicly traded companies whose value is difficult to determine 
gateway records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
gateway records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
while gateway has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event gateway were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should gateway determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made

in  million of beyond the box revenue was sold at the point of sale and million was sold after the point of sale 
the decline in beyond the box revenue on a year over year basis is primarily attributable to the decline in unit shipments as well as the company s decision to discontinue certain non profitable revenue streams mentioned above 
during the first quarter of  the company modified its strategic alliance with america online  inc aol whereby it will convert existing gateway 
net customers to the aol branded internet access in order to improve the customer experience and the economic return to the company for such subscribers 
in addition  the company began to participate earlier in a greater share of recurring income on new prepaid isp subscribers rather than earning a higher fee for re selling prepaid isp subscriptions at the point of sale and participating in the recurring income stream at a later date 
the change in the strategic alliance has resulted in the company reporting substantially less revenue from isp at the point of sale 
this change has the effect of negatively impacting average selling price  as well as the sales mix percentage of beyond the box revenue while favorably impacting the gross profit percentage of beyond the box items

new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations fas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
fas requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
under fas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life 
the amortization provisions of fas apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   the company is required to adopt fas effective january  the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  which supersedes both statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fas and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions opinion  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
fas retains the fundamental provisions in fas for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with fas for example  fas provides guidance on how a long lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
fas retains the basic provisions of opinion on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike fas  an impairment assessment under fas will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company is required to adopt fas no later than its first fiscal year beginning after december  management does not expect the adoption of fas for long lived assets held for use to have a material impact on the company s financial statements because the impairment assessment under fas is largely unchanged from fas the provisions of this statement for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities and therefore  will depend on future actions initiated by management 
as a result  management cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of fas will have on the company s financial statements with respect to future disposal decisions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included herein for discussion of decisions made in early item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during the third quarter of  the company made the decision to exit substantially all of its company owned international operations 
prior to this decision  the company used foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions and probable anticipated foreign currency transactions 
these forward contracts were designated as a hedge of international sales by us dollar functional currency entities and intercompany purchases by certain foreign subsidiaries 
the principal currencies hedged were the british pound  japanese yen  french franc  australian dollar  singapore dollar and the deutsche mark over periods ranging from one to six months 
forward contracts were accounted for on a mark to market basis  with realized and unrealized gains or losses recognized currently 
gains or losses arising from forward contracts which were effective as a hedge were included in the basis of the designated transactions 
the related receivable or liability with counterparties to the forward contracts is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet

the company is generally not subject to material market risk with respect to its investments classified as marketable securities as such investments are readily marketable  liquid and do not fluctuate substantially from stated value 
marketable equity securities that have certain regulatory disposal limitations could contain some market risk 
the company has approximately million of marketable equity securities as of december  regarding long term investments  gateway holds and expects to continue to consider investments in minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within gateway s strategic focus 
many of these investments are in early stage companies  investment funds or internet or e commerce companies where operations are not yet sufficient to establish them as profitable concerns 
certain of these investments are in publicly traded companies whose share prices are highly volatile 
adverse changes in market conditions such as occurred in years and  and poor operating results of certain of these underlying investments have resulted and may in the future result in gateway incurring losses or an inability to recover the original carrying value of its investments 
as of december   the company held long term investments of approximately million
