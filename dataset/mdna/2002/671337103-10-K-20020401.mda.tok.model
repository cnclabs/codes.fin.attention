effect of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for using the purchase method 
the pooling of interests method of accounting is prohibited except for combinations initiated before july  the remaining provisions of sfas no 
relating to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method  including identification of intangible assets  accounting for negative goodwill  financial statement presentation and disclosure  are effective for combinations initiated after june  management adopted sfas no 
effective july   as required  without material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  which prescribes accounting for all purchased goodwill and intangible assets 
pursuant to sfas no 
 acquired goodwill is not amortized  but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and whenever an impairment indicator arises 
all goodwill should be assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the goodwill 
when an entity reorganizes its reporting structure  goodwill should be reallocated to reporting units based on the relative fair values of the units 
goodwill impairment should be tested with a two step approach 
first  the fair value of the reporting unit should be compared to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  then any goodwill impairment should be measured as the excess of goodwill s carrying value over its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill should be calculated in the same manner as goodwill is calculated for a business combination  using the reporting unit s fair value as the purchase price 
therefore  goodwill s implied fair value will be the excess of the purchase price over the amounts allocated to assets  including unrecognized intangible assets  and liabilities of the reporting unit 
goodwill impairment losses should be reported in the income statement as a separate line item within operations  except for such losses included in the calculation of a gain or loss from discontinued operations 
an acquired intangible asset  other than goodwill  should be amortized over its useful economic life 
the useful life of an intangible asset is indefinite if it extends beyond the foreseeable horizon 
if an asset s life is indefinite  the asset should not be amortized until the life is determined to be finite 
intangible assets being amortized should be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
intangible assets not being amortized should be tested for impairment  annually and whenever there are indicators of impairment  by comparing the asset s fair value to its carrying amount 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  until adoption of sfas no 
 existing goodwill continues to be amortized and tested for impairment under previously existing standards 
as of the date sfas no 
is adopted and based on the company s current reporting structure  reporting units should be established  net assets should be assigned to reporting units  unless they do not relate to a reporting unit  and goodwill should be assigned to one or more reporting units 
within six months of adopting sfas no 
 a company must have completed the first step of the goodwill transitional impairment test a comparison  as of the beginning of the fiscal year  of each reporting unit s fair value with its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds fair value  the second step calculating the amount of goodwill impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal year would be required as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the fiscal year 
any transitional impairment loss would be reported as a change in accounting principle in the first interim period financial statements of the implementation year  regardless of when the loss measurement is completed 
after completion of the first step of the transitional test  a company should disclose which segments might have to recognize an impairment loss and when the potential loss would be measured 
if an impairment indicator arises before the completion of the transition testing  a full impairment test would be required as soon as possible 
any goodwill impairment resulting from this test should be reported as an impairment loss  not as a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  as the elimination of annual goodwill amortization will increase earnings by approximately  in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
carries over the recognition and measurement provisions in sfas no 
accordingly  an entity should recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group a is not recoverable and b exceeds its fair value 
similar to sfas no 
 sfas no 
requires an entity to test an asset or asset group for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
sfas no 
differs from sfas no 
in that it provides guidance on estimating future cash flows to test recoverability 
an entity may use either a probability weighted approach or best estimate approach in developing estimates of cash flow to test recoverability 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
management adopted sfas no 
effective january   as required  without material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations
