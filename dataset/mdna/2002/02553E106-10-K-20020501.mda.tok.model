the company bases its estimates and assumptions on the best available information and believes them to be reasonable for the circumstances 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgement and complexity 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company principally records revenue upon purchase of merchandise by customers 
revenue is not recorded on the purchase of stored value cards and gift certificates by customers 
a current liability is recorded upon purchase and revenue is recognized when the card is redeemed for merchandise 
revenue is recorded net of sales returns 
a sales returns reserve is provided on gross sales for projected merchandise returns based on historical average return percentages 
revenue is not recorded on the sell off of end of season  overstock and irregular merchandise to liquidators 
these sell offs are typically sold below cost 
proceeds from sell offs have an insignificant effect on cost of sales 
leasehold improvements 
the company capitalizes leasehold improvement costs  net of construction allowances 
these assets are stated at cost and amortized utilizing the straight line method over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the life of the lease generally five to ten years 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  management evaluates the ongoing value of leasehold improvements associated with retail stores which have been open longer than one year 
when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets  impairment losses are recorded 
when events such as these occur  the impaired assets are adjusted to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
should actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated  additional losses may be recorded 
inventory 
merchandise inventory is valued at the lower of average cost or market  utilizing the retail method 
average cost includes merchandise design and sourcing costs and related expenses 
the company reviews its inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and generally uses markdowns to clear merchandise 
if inventory exceeds customer demand for reasons of style  seasonal adaptation  changes in customer preference  lack of consumer acceptance of fashion items  competition  or if it is determined that the inventory in stock will not sell at its currently ticketed price  additional markdowns may be necessary 
these markdowns may have an adverse impact on earnings  depending on the extent and amount of inventory affected

income taxes we had deferred tax assets of million at february   which resulted primarily from financial and tax accounting differences 
we have had taxable income during each of the past three tax years and anticipate that future taxable income will be able to recover the full amount of the deferred tax assets 
a portion of the deferred tax assets has resulted from a capital loss 
we anticipate that we will have sufficient capital gain income to recognize the benefit recorded from the loss 
assuming a effective tax rate  we will need to recognize pretax net income of approximately million in future periods to recover existing deferred tax amounts 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant effect on our net sales or our profitability 
substantial increases in cost  however  could have a significant impact on our business and the industry in the future

historically  our operations have been seasonal  with a significant amount of net sales and net income occurring in the fourth fiscal quarter  reflecting increased demand during the year end holiday selling season and  to a lesser extent  the third quarter  reflecting increased demand during the back to school selling season 
during fiscal  these periods accounted for approximately of our sales 
as a result of this seasonality  any factors negatively affecting us during the third and fourth fiscal quarters of any year  including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for the entire year
