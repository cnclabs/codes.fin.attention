item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis  explains the general financial condition and the results of operations for guilford and its subsidiaries  including where our revenues came from  what our revenues and expenses were in  and  why revenues and expenses changed from the year before  what factors affect our business  how all of the foregoing affect our overall financial condition  and what our expenditures for capital projects were in  and and a description of our capital requirements 
as you read this management s discussion and analysis  you may find it helpful to refer to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report 
these consolidated financial statements present the results of our operations for  and as well as our financial position at december  and we analyze and explain the annual changes in the specific line items set forth in our consolidated statements of operations 
our analysis may be important to you in making decisions about your investment in guilford 
critical accounting policies and practices in cautionary advice regarding disclosures about critical accounting policies sec release no 
 december   the sec advised registrants to provide more information about a company s most critical accounting policies  ie  the specific accounting policies that have the most impact on a company s results and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
we have identified two of our accounting policies that may constitute critical accounting policies  under the guidance provided by this release 
first  is our decision to apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  to account for our stock option plans rather than statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

had we applied sfas no 
 our net loss in  and would have been increased by approximately million  million and million  respectively see note to the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements 
second  is our estimate for product returns in connection with our sales of gliadel wafer 
we have applied a historical return rate to our unit sales to provide an allowance for future product returns under our product return policy 
this historical return rate is calculated by blending the significant product return experience of our previous marketing  sales and distribution partner  aventis  with our own product return experience 
the product return rate is periodically updated to reflect actual experience 
results of operations in this section we discuss our   and revenues  costs and expenses  and other income and expenses  as well as the factors affecting each of them 
revenues during  our revenues primarily came from our net product sales of gliadel wafer to hospitals  wholesalers and specialty distributors 
during and our revenues primarily came from the following sources net product sales of gliadel wafer to our marketing  sales and distribution partners  aventis pharmaceuticals products  inc  or aventis  milestone payments from aventis and amgen  inc  or amgen  under corporate collaboration agreements  non cash contract revenues under the agreements with aventis or amgen pursuant to the implementation of sab  quarterly research funding from amgen  and royalty payments from aventis on its sales of gliadel wafer to others  primarily hospitals 
during   and  we recognized net revenues of million  million  and million  respectively 
these revenues consisted of the following in millions revenues related to gliadel wafer net product sales license fees and royalties non recurring milestone payments non recurring rights and milestone payments pursuant to implementation of sab revenues from amgen non recurring milestone payments non recurring rights and milestone payments pursuant to implementation of sab research funding under collaborative agreements other total gliadel wafer in june  we entered into a marketing  sales and distribution agreement  together with related agreements with rhone poulenc rorer  predecessor in interest to aventis pharmaceuticals products inc  or aventis 
under these agreements the aventis agreements we granted aventis the worldwide other than scandinavian  and later japanese marketing rights to gliadel wafer  a biodegradable polymer used for the treatment of brain cancer 
at the time that we entered into the aventis agreements  we received million from aventis million as an equity investment and million as a one time non refundable rights payment 
in september  the fda cleared gliadel wafer to be marketed for use in connection with surgery for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme  a certain type of primary brain cancer 
from the commercial launch of gliadel wafer in february  until december   we manufactured the product for marketing  sale and distribution by aventis and orion corporation pharma our scandinavian marketing partner for the product 
in exchange we received milestone payments from aventis upon the occurrence of certain events  such as the receipt of marketing approval both in the united states and internationally and royalties in respect of aventis sales 
in october  we reacquired aventis rights in gliadel wafer for  shares of our common stock at an approximate value of million and the assumption of obligations for product returns occurring after december  after a transition period which ended on december   we began marketing  selling and distributing gliadel wafer ourselves on january  revenue from gliadel wafer net product sales for the year ended december   we earned million from net product sales of gliadel wafer to hospitals  wholesalers and specialty distributors 
for the years ended december  and  we earned million and million  respectively  from net product sales to our marketing  sales and distribution partners  aventis for the entire world  except scandinavia and japan and orion corporation pharma for scandinavia only 
for the year ended december   our financial statements record the entire selling price of gliadel wafer as net product sales  due to our reacquisition of the product effective january  for the years ended december   and  we recognized revenue on our sale of gliadel wafer to aventis in accordance with our contractual arrangements  at approximately of the net product sales price established by aventis 
the decrease in revenues attributable to sales of gliadel wafer to aventis in when compared to we believe is due to aventis managing its existing inventory to meet demand for the product 
during the year ended december   we sold gliadel wafer i directly to hospitals  ii by drop shipment to hospitals pursuant to purchase orders from wholesalers  and iii to specialty distributors  who stock our product and provide us with additional marketing and distribution capabilities 
it is our policy to recognize net product sales revenue only after i we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii the price is fixed and determinable  iii title has passed  and iv collection is reasonable assured 
normal payment terms include discounts for early payment with payment being due in days 
the company s credit and exchange policy includes provisions for exchange of a product that i has expired  or ii was damaged in shipment 
we sold  units during the year ended december   recognizing approximately million in net product sales 
over of unit sales of gliadel wafer for the year ended december   were sold to customers within the united states 
the remaining units were sold outside the united states  including europe  canada and south america  either through distributors or direct to hospitals 
approximately million  or of total net product sales resulted from sales directly to hospitals or drop shipped to hospitals pursuant to purchase orders from wholesalers 
as noted in the following paragraph  as we expand the utilization of specialty distributors in the future we expect sales directly to hospitals or through wholesalers  as a percentage of total units sold  to decrease significantly 
substantially all of these sales to hospitals and wholesalers included our normal payment terms including discounts for early payment 
approximately million  or of total net product sales during the year ended december  were sold to specialty distributors to capitalize on their marketing and distribution strengths and to reduce our cost of distributing the product directly to hospitals 
one specialty distributor accounted for approximately million in net product sales representing of total units sales during the year ended december  as we continue to utilize the services of these specialty distributors in the future  we expect the units sold to these specialty distributors  as a percentage of the total units sold  to increase significantly 
with the exception of the initial order where the specialty distributors were offered extended payment terms up to days  the company s normal payment terms apply 
during  to increase the awareness and availability of gliadel wafer among neurosurgeons  and to ensure our product was available to the neurosurgeon when needed  we sold gliadel wafer under our ensured availability marketing program which provided our customers with extended payment terms 
of the approximately million in revenue on the units sold during the year ended december   approximately million included payment terms of up to days pursuant to this program 
as of december   of the approximately million unpaid  million was paid during january and february  and the remaining balances are not due until the quarter ending june  our international sales for the year ended december  amounted to less than million  or of total revenue from sales of gliadel wafer 
royalties from gliadel wafer royalties on sales by aventis prior to our reacquisition of the rights to market  sell and distribute gliadel wafer effective january   in addition to recognizing net product sales revenue on our sale of gliadel wafer to aventis  we also recognized royalty revenue based on aventis sales of the product to third parties  such as hospitals 
for the years ended december  and  royalty revenue on aventis sales of gliadel wafer to third parties was million for each year 
contract revenues contract revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as a result of the reacquisition of gliadel wafer from aventis and the termination of our collaboration with amgen  no contract revenues were recognized from these or any other partners during the year ended december  prior to the reacquisition of gliadel wafer  we received certain non refundable upfront fees and milestone payments from aventis 
we earned non refundable milestone payments from aventis of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  upon receipt of approval to market and sell gliadel wafer in certain countries 
pursuant to our agreement with amgen to research  develop  and commercialize our fkbp neuroimmunophilin ligand technology  amgen was required to make milestone payments to us if amgen achieved specified regulatory and product development milestones 
during the year ended december   we recognized million in milestone payments from amgen 
the remaining contract revenue in is the result of our adoption of sab  in the fourth quarter of  effective january  our previous accounting policy was to recognize as revenue certain non refundable upfront fees at the inception of the arrangement 
under sab  collaborative arrangements that include a non refundable upfront fee and contain an element of continuing involvement must be deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of continuing involvement 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of contract revenues upon adoption of sab revenues under collaborative agreements as part of our collaboration with amgen  amgen agreed to fund up to a total of million to support our research relating to the fkbp neuroimmunophilin ligand technology 
this research funding began on october  and was payable quarterly over three years 
the last quarterly payment was made on july  cost of sales and gross margin our cost of sales for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively  including unabsorbed manufacturing overhead of million for the year ended december  cost of sales for the years ended december   and  includes the cost of materials  labor and overhead 
the cost to manufacture gliadel wafer at current market levels can vary materially with production volume 
to the extent that gliadel wafer production levels increase or decrease in the future  we anticipate that the unit cost to manufacture gliadel wafer may decrease or increase  respectively 
based on our experience to date  we would expect the cost of net product sales of gliadel wafer to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
research and development expenses we engage in numerous research and development projects in order to expand and develop our portfolio of proprietary technologies and product candidates  primarily in two areas biopolymer technology for drug delivery and pharmaceutical research and development 
the status of the major projects comprising our portfolio is status biopolymer technologies gliadel wafer marketed paclimer microspheres ovarian cancer phase i ii lidomer microspheres phase i paclimer microspheres lung cancer phase i other biopolymer products research pre clinical pharmaceuticals and other technologies gpi  neuroimmunophilin ligand phase ii aquavan injection phase i gpi  naaladase inhibitor phase i parp inhibitors research other cns products research for each project  we may incur direct expenses such as salaries and other costs of personnel  raw materials and supplies utilized  and third party contracted research costs  consulting and other clinical development costs 
shared expenses  such as facility and equipment costs  utilities  project management and other administrative overhead  are allocated to research and development projects based on occupancy percentages  infrastructure requirements and personnel effort 
our research and development expenses were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these expenses were divided among our technology platforms in the following manner in thousands years ended december  biopolymer technologies pharmaceuticals other shared expenses total research development biopolymer technologies with respect to our biopolymer technologies  the modest decrease in compared to reflects less development expenses incurred related to paclimer microspheres offset by an increase in expenses related to lidomer tm microspheres as it advanced into the clinic 
the decrease in compared to is a result of advancing paclimer microspheres into the clinic offsetting a reduction in spending on research to select an appropriate product candidate 
pharmaceuticals other research and development expenses related to our pharmaceutical and related technologies increased in compared to this increase is the result of advancing aquavan tm injection and gpi into clinical trials and was offset by a reduction in expenses associated with our fkbp neuroimmunophilin program  as amgen  inc  our former corporate partner  completed its research funding to us 
the increase in compared to is a result of our acquisition of the rights to  and beginning the development of  aquavan tm injection 
shared expenses shared expenses include the costs of operating and maintaining our facilities  property and equipment used in the research and development processes  and management effort allocable to research and development projects 
the increases from year to year result from increased costs to operate our facilities as we occupied our new research and development facility during the second half of  and increased expenses associated with our project management efforts as the number and magnitude of our projects have increased 
the projects we currently have in process are at various stages of development 
for example  aquavan tm injection  gpi  one of our naaladase inhibitor compounds  paclimer microspheres and lidomer tm microspheres are currently in human clinical trials 
several other projects  such as our parp program  are in earlier stages of research 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict given the purpose  number and timing of studies that will need to be conducted for any of our product candidates 
in general  pharmaceutical development involves a series of stages beginning with the identification of a potential target  development of a suitable drug  proof of concept in pre clinical models and several phases of testing in humans each of which is typically more costly than the previous stage 
also  product candidates that appear promising at earlier stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
product candidates may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to pass through clinical trials than had been anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals and may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable costs and with acceptable quality 
furthermore  as part of our corporate development strategy  we may enter into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates and it is uncertain which of our product candidates would be subject to future collaborative arrangements 
the participation of a collaborative partner may accelerate the time to completion and reduce our costs or it may delay the time and increase the cost to us due to the alteration of existing development strategy 
because of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully complete the development of our product candidates or the ultimate development cost 
for a complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with developing our product candidates  see the section in this annual report titled risk factors 
at december   we employed individuals on a full time basis in the areas of research and development  including individuals responsible for manufacturing gliadel wafer and other product candidates currently under development 
we employed individuals and individuals in these areas at december  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the costs incurred to market  sell and distribute gliadel wafer were million 
we incurred million in costs associated with the reacquisition and re launch of gliadel wafer during the fourth quarter of prior to the fourth quarter of  we did not have a marketing  sales and distribution function within the company 
during october  the company entered into a three year agreement the cardinal agreement with cardinal health sales and marketing services cardinal to provide guilford with sales representatives for its gliadel wafer product 
included in our costs to market  sell and distribute gliadel wafer is million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  for services provided by cardinal under the cardinal agreement 
costs and expenses associated with our general and administrative functions were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our general and administrative functions include the areas of executive management  finance  investor and public relations  corporate development  and legal 
additionally  we include the costs to prepare  file  and prosecute domestic and international patent applications and for other activities to establish and preserve our intellectual property rights in our general and administrative expenses 
for each function  we may incur direct expenses such as salaries  supplies  and third party consulting and other external costs 
indirect costs such as facilities  utilities and other administrative overhead are also allocated to these functions 
as we continued to expand our corporate development activities  our costs and expenses associated with this function have increased from year to year 
at december   we employed individuals on a full time basis in selling  general and administrative areas  of which were in the marketing  sales and distribution function 
the remaining individuals were in the general and administrative functions  which compares to and at december  and  respectively 
in addition to the individuals in the marketing  sales and distribution function  a total of field sales representatives and managers sold gliadel wafer on our behalf under the cardinal agreement 
merger costs on august   we terminated the agreement and plan of merger previously entered into on may  with gliatech  inc we incurred costs related to this proposed merger transaction of million for the year ended december  other income and expense other income and expense consists primarily of investment income on our investments and interest expense on our debt and other financial obligations 
our investment income was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease in investment income in compared to was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on moderately larger investment balances maintained during the year 
investment income in compared with remained the same as average investment balances and interest rates earned on those balances during were comparable to we incurred interest expense of million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these expenses resulted primarily from i loans from a commercial bank that helped fund the construction of our manufacturing  administrative  and research and development facilities and the purchase of certain furniture and equipment  ii capital leases entered into for the purchase of computer equipment  and iii a note payable pursuant to an agreement to provide us with sales representatives to market and sell gliadel wafer 
we describe these obligations in notes  and to the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle we recorded a non cash charge to earnings of million as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the implementation of sab our previous accounting policy was to recognize as revenue certain non refundable upfront fees at the inception of a collaborative arrangement 
under sab  non refundable upfront fee arrangements that contain an element of continuing involvement must be deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of involvement 
as of december   the company has recognized as revenue the full amount of non refundable upfront fee payments subject to deferral under sab liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities  revenues from the sale of gliadel wafer  funding pursuant to collaborative agreements and proceeds from loans and other borrowing arrangements 
for the three year period ended december   we received million from issuance of common stock  million from net product sales and royalties from gliadel wafer  million in non recurring payments under our collaborative agreements and million as proceeds from borrowing arrangements 
our cash  cash equivalents  and investments were approximately million at december  of this amount  we pledged million as collateral for certain of our loans and other financial lease obligations 
in addition to these restricted investments  the company is required to maintain  in the aggregate  unrestricted cash  cash equivalents  and investments of million at all times under the terms of certain of its financial obligations 
during  to increase the awareness and availability of gliadel wafer among neurosurgeons  and to ensure our product was available to the neurosurgeon when needed  we sold gliadel wafer under our ensured availability marketing program which provided our customers with extended payment terms 
approximately million of net product sales were recognized pursuant to this marketing program 
at december   of the approximately million unpaid  million was paid during january and february and the remaining million is not due until the quarter ending june  our long term total debt increased a net million to million at december   compared to million at december  this increase is primarily due to a million note payable  pursuant to an agreement for the supply of sales representatives for our gliadel wafer marketing  sales and distribution effort 
during october  the company entered into a three year agreement the cardinal agreement with cardinal health sales and marketing services cardinal to provide guilford with sales representatives for its gliadel wafer product 
in accordance with the terms of the cardinal agreement  during the first year of the cardinal agreement  the company was obligated to pay cardinal only million of total costs charged by cardinal 
amounts charged in excess of million were converted to a note payable on october  in the amount of million 
principal and interest on the note are paid monthly and the note is due september during the year ended december   the company repaid million in principal 
additionally  we entered into million in capital leases in connection with our acquisition of computer equipment and financed certain insurance premiums of million during the year ended december  these increases in long term debt were offset by million in repayments 
we also made principal repayments on our existing bond  term and other loans of million 
we have funded our capital expenditures by either leasing the equipment pursuant to our equipment lease arrangements or purchasing the equipment utilizing our existing cash 
we funded capital expenditures of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
of the capital expenditures funded during the year ended december   million were funded pursuant to equipment lease arrangements and million were acquired through the use of our cash 
in order to meet our anticipated future facilities needs  we initiated a project to design  construct  and lease a research and development facility 
to accomplish this task  in february  we entered into a real estate development agreement and operating lease with a special purpose entity  or spe  sponsored by a commercial bank 
the spe is not consolidated in our consolidated financial statements and we have accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases  as amended 
this facility  which was substantially completed in june for a total cost of approximately million  was constructed adjacent to our current headquarters in baltimore  maryland and provides approximately  square feet of research and development capacity 
the initial lease term is for a period of months including the construction period and expires in february we have the option to either purchase the facility on the remaining anniversary dates during the initial lease term  or sell the facility to a third party at the expiration of the initial lease term 
in the event the facility is sold to a third party  we will be obligated to pay the lessor any shortfall between the sales price and of the lessor s net investment in the facility 
the lessor s net investment in the facility was approximately million at december  and we anticipate that it will be further reduced to approximately million by the expiration of the initial lease term in february we are required to maintain collateral equal to approximately of the remaining balance of the lessor s net investment in the facility 
we had cash collateral of million as of december  and  which is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as investments restricted 
in addition to this cash collateral requirement  we are subject to various other affirmative and negative covenants  the most restrictive of which requires us to maintain unrestricted cash  cash equivalents  and investments in the aggregate equal to million 
pursuant to the terms of the operating lease agreement  we are obligated to make monthly lease payments equal to the interest  based on monthly libor plus  calculated on the lessor s net investment in the facility plus principal of  as a result of the interest rate swap agreements entered into during and with a commercial bank  we effectively fixed the interest rates on these variable interest rate based lease payments at approximately in the aggregate 
these interest rate swap agreements provide the commercial bank with a call provision exercisable during assuming the commercial bank exercises its call provision  we would be exposed to market risk related to the underlying interest rates of the operating lease 
we describe these interest rate swap transactions with the commercial bank in note to the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements 
we anticipate that this research and development facility  along with our headquarters  will support our research and development activities through at least the end of we may be required to seek additional office space to support commercial and administrative activities 
should this be required  we would expect to lease such facilities at market rates for a period not to exceed three years 
during and  we entered into a series of interest rate swap transactions with a commercial bank covering million of our bond and term loans 
as a result  we fixed the interest rates on our debt at approximately in the aggregate 
the notional amounts of these interest rate swap agreements amortize at the same rate as the underlying bond and term loans 
we describe these interest rate swap transactions with the commercial bank in note to the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements 
during  we established an unsecured  revolving line of credit for million with a commercial bank 
borrowings under this line of credit are payable on demand at an interest rate of libor plus 
no amounts were drawn under this line of credit in  or in  our board of directors approved a program to purchase up to  shares of our common stock in the open market from time to time at our discretion 
in august  the company terminated this share repurchase program 
we repurchased a total of  of our shares under this program for an aggregate cash outlay of approximately million 
we expect to need significantly greater capital to continue our research and product development programs and pre clinical and clinical testing and to manufacture and market  sell and distribute our products 
we will also need additional funds to meet our future facility expansion needs if necessary 
our capital requirements depend on a number of factors  including the progress of our research and development programs  the progress of pre clinical and clinical testing  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  changes in our existing research relationships  competing technological and market developments  our ability to establish collaborative arrangements  our ability to enter into licensing agreements and contractual arrangements with others  and the progress of efforts to scale up manufacturing processes 
we believe that our existing resources will be sufficient to fund our activities through at least december  however  we may need significantly greater capital in the near future to increase pre clinical and clinical development activities for product candidates  such as gpi our lead fkbp neuroimmunophilin ligand  paclimer microspheres  gpi our lead naaladase inhibitor  aquavan tm injection our propofol prodrug  lidomer tm microspheres our delayed release lidocaine analgesic product candidate targeting post surgical pain  and parp inhibitors 
additionally  in order to leverage the capabilities of our commercial operations group  we are investigating the possibility of in licensing additional hospital based products within our targeted markets 
in order to acquire one or more of these products  we may require significant additional capital 
the following are contractual commitments at december  associated with debt obligations  lease obligations and our research and development projects in thousands payments due by period contractual commitment total year years years thereafter long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases research and development facility lease research and development arrangements total contractual commitments this table does not include any milestone payments under agreements we have entered into in relation to our in licensed technology  as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 
also  minimum annual research expenditures pursuant to such license agreements have been excluded from this table as we expect to spend those amounts as we progress the development of the underlying technologies 
in the aggregate these minimum annual research expenditures are approximately million and typically apply to all years prior to regulatory approval of a product incorporating the licensed technology 
in february  we entered into a real estate development agreement and operating lease with a special purpose entity sponsored by a commercial bank which we will refer to as lessor in this section to acquire construct and lease a research and development facility 
construction was completed in at a total cost covered by this lease of approximately million 
we account for this lease as an operating lease and  as a result  record neither an asset nor a liability on our balance sheet 
the amounts included in the table above include only our annual lease payments of approximately million for the remainder of the initial lease term ending february our lease payments represent variable rate interest payments indexed to the london interbank offered rate on the lessor s net investment in the facility plus principal of  per month 
as a result of certain interest rate swap agreements entered into by us  we have effectively fixed the interest rate on this variable interest rate based lease at approximately 
at the expiration of the initial lease term  we may either purchase the facility or sell the facility to a third party 
the lease provides a residual value guarantee from us to the lessor in the event the facility is sold to a third party for less than of the lessor s net investment in the facility 
we do not believe that our facility has experienced a property value decline since it was constructed 
however  we have no assurance that the property value will not decline between now and the termination of the initial lease on or before february includes commitments that we have entered into at december  to engage third parties to perform various aspects of our research and development efforts subsequent to december  recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
in addition  the standard includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing intangibles as goodwill and reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have an initial impact on our consolidated financial statements since we have determined that our intangible asset of the rights to market  sell and distribute gliadel wafer  has a finite life  which is consistent with our current accounting treatment 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas required the recognition of a liability for an asset retirement in the period in which it is incurred 
a retirement obligation is defined as one in which a legal obligation exists in the future resulting from existing laws  statutes or contracts 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have any immediate impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which supercedes both sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb  for the disposal of a business segment as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas retains the fundamental provisions in sfas for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas for example  sfas provides guidance on how long lived assets that are used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribed the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
sfas retains the basic provisions of apb on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike sfas  an impairment assessment under sfas will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we are required to adopt sfas no later than the year beginning after december   and plan to adopt its provisions for the quarter ending march  we do not expect the adoption of sfas for assets held for use to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements because the requirement for the assessment of impairment under sfas is largely unchanged from sfas the provisions of the new standard for assets held for sale or disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities 
therefore  we cannot determine the potential effects that the adoption of these provisions of sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
outlook during the year ending december   we expect sales of gliadel wafer to be between million and million 
previously  we had disclosed that we expected gliadel wafer sales to be between and million 
this previous guidance assumed that we would receive an approval prior to the end of the first quarter of from the fda regarding our supplemental new drug application for the use of gliadel wafer during initial surgery 
in march  we received notification from the fda that our supplemental new drug application was not approvable 
although we plan to address with the fda issues the agency raised regarding this application  we cannot be certain that we will be successful in our attempt to receive an expanded label for gliadel wafer in the united states during  or at all 
accordingly  we have reduced our projections for gliadel wafer sales for to be consistent with sales we achieved during because we expect the market to be the same 
during  we also plan to expand our presence globally  and expect to sign agreements with international distributors to expand the use of gliadel wafer in markets outside the united states 
in order to leverage the capabilities of our commercial operations group  we are investigating the possibility of in licensing additional hospital based products within our target markets 
we are seeking new corporate collaborations during we are continuously in discussions with potential partners regarding rights to our products  product candidates and research programs 
as a result of sab  we are currently not able to define the extent to which any payments received in from partnering activities would be recorded as revenue 
we currently anticipate research and development expenses in to be approximately million to million 
almost all of the increase in research and development expenses over these expenses in  will be related to increased clinical development costs 
we anticipate that general and administrative costs will be consistent with we expect marketing  sales and distribution costs to increase modestly from the levels incurred in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales are expected to be in the range of to of net product sales  although increases or decreases in quarterly production levels may cause volatility in the cost of sales percentages 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a substantial portion of our assets are investment grade debt instruments such as direct obligations of the us treasury  securities of federal agencies which carry the direct or implied guarantee of the us government  bank certificates of deposit and corporate securities  including commercial paper and corporate debt instruments 
the market value of such investments fluctuates with current market interest rates 
in general  as rates increase  the market value of a debt instrument would be expected to decrease 
the opposite is also true 
to minimize such market risk  we have in the past and  to the extent possible  will continue in the future to hold such debt instruments to maturity at which time the debt instrument will be redeemed at its stated or face value 
due to the short duration and nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio at december  was million and yield to maturity was approximately 
the weighted average return on our investments during the year ended december  was approximately 
substantially all of our financial obligations were established with interest rates which fluctuate with market conditions 
as a hedge against such fluctuations in interest rates  we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements with a commercial bank counter party  to exchange substantially all of our variable rates of interest on certain financial obligations for fixed rates 
our borrowings under our bond and term loans and financial obligations under certain lease arrangements are approximately million 
pursuant to these borrowing arrangements  we are obligated to pay variable interest rates on substantially all of these obligations of libor plus between and 
the interest rate swap agreements have a total notional principal amount of approximately million as of december  pursuant to these interest rate swap agreements  we pay a fixed rate of interest to the counter party of approximately and receive from the counter party a variable rate of interest of libor plus
