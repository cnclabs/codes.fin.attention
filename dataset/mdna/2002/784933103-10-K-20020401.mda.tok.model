in  ibj whitehall business credit corporation ibj whitehall and the members of the spar group other than pia canada collectively  the borrowers entered into a revolving credit  term loan and security agreement as amended the bank loan agreement 
the bank loan agreement provides the borrowers with a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
the revolving credit facility allows the borrowers to borrow up to million based upon a borrowing base formula as defined in the agreement principally of eligible accounts receivable 
the bank loan agreement s revolving credit loans of million were scheduled to mature on september  on march   ibj whitehall extended the maturity date to february  the term loan amortized in equal monthly installments of  and was repaid in full as of december  the revolving loans bear interest at ibj whitehall s alternate base rate plus one half of one percent a total of per annum at december  
in addition  the borrowers are required to make mandatory prepayments in an amount equal to of excess cash flow  as defined in the bank loan agreement  for each fiscal year  to be applied first to the term loan and then to the revolving credit loans subject to the borrowers ability to re borrow revolving advances in accordance with the terms of the bank loan agreement 
in july  the company made an additional  payment on the term loan as a result of the excess cash flow requirement 
the facility is secured with all the assets of the company and its subsidiaries 
the bank loan agreement contains an option for the bank to purchase  shares of common stock of the company for per share in the event that the company s average closing share price over a ten consecutive trading day period exceeds per share 
this option expires september  the bank loan agreement contains certain financial covenants that must be met by the borrowers on a consolidated basis  among which are a minimum net worth  a fixed charge coverage ratio  a minimum ratio of debt to ebitda  and a minimum ebitda  as such terms are defined in the bank loan agreement 
the company was in compliance worth such financial covenants on december   with the exception of the minimum net worth covenant due to the estimated loss on disposal of discontinued operations  for which a waiver was obtained from ibj whitehall 
the balances outstanding on the revolving line of credit were million and million at december   and december   respectively 
as of december   based upon the borrowing base formula  the spar group had availability of million of the million unused revolving line of credit 
as of december   the company is obligated  under certain circumstances  to pay costs in connection with the merger restructure charges of approximately million 
in addition  the company incurred substantial cost in connection with the transaction  including legal  accounting and investment banking fees estimated to be an aggregate unpaid obligation as of december   of approximately million 
the company has also accrued approximately million for expenses incurred by pia prior to the merger  which have not been paid as of december  management believes the current bank credit facilities are sufficient to fund operations and working capital  including the current maturities of debt obligations  but may not be sufficient to reduce certain of the pre merger obligations of the pia companies inherited in the merger 
in and prior years  certain principal stockholders of the company each made loans to certain spar companies in the aggregate amount of million to facilitate the acquisition of the pia companies and the assets of old mci 
these stockholders were also owed million in unpaid distributions relating to the former status of certain of the operating spar companies as subchapter s corporations see note to the financial statements 
those amounts were converted into promissory notes issued to these certain stockholders severally by smf  sinc and spgi prior to the merger  which aggregated million 
during  with the consent of the company those stockholders applied approximately  of such indebtedness in payment of the exercise price of certain of their respective stock options to purchase shares of common stock of the company 
as of december   a total of million remained outstanding under these notes with an interest rate of and are due on demand 
the current bank loan agreement contains certain restrictions on the repayment of stockholder debt 
management believes that based upon the company s current working capital position and the existing credit facilities  funding will be sufficient to support ongoing operations over the next twelve months 
however  delays in collection of receivables due from any of the company s major clients  or a significant reduction in business from such clients  or the inability to acquire new clients  would have a material adverse effect on the company s cash resources and its ongoing ability to fund operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to the variable interest rate on the line of credit and the variable yield on its cash and cash equivalents 
the company s accounting policies for financial instruments and disclosures relating to financial instruments require that the company s consolidated balance sheets include the following financial instruments cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and long term debt 
the company considers carrying amounts of current assets and liabilities in the condensed consolidated financial statements to approximate the fair value for these financial instruments because of the relatively short period of time between origination of the instruments and their expected realization 
the carrying amounts of long term debt approximate fair value because the obligation bears interest at a floating rate 
the company monitors the risks associated with interest rates and financial instrument positions 
the company s investment policy objectives require the preservation and safety of the principal  and the maximization of the return on investment based upon the safety and liquidity objectives 
currently  the company s international operations are not material and  therefore  the risk related to foreign currency exchange rates is not material 
investment portfolio the company has no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments in its cash and cash equivalents and investments 
excess cash is normally used to pay down the revolving line of credit
