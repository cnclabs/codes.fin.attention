item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general oil and gas prices remained strong during the first half of before declining for the remainder of the year due to  among other reasons  the global economic slowdown which reduced demand for oil and natural gas 
while we recognized record levels of revenue in early  the rate of growth in revenues decreased in the latter part of primarily as a result of the decline of the north american natural gas market 
activity outside north america has been less volatile than domestic activity 
we continue our efforts to expand our market presence by opening strategic facilities and realizing synergies within our business lines 
also  as a result of the consolidation in the oil and gas industry  some of our customers have used and may continue to use their global presence and market influence to seek economies of scale and pricing concessions 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based on financial statements prepared in conformity with gaap and require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and base these estimates on our historical experience as well as on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable in a given circumstance 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations o revenue recognition  o valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  o estimating valuation allowances related to inventory  and o accounting for income taxes 
for a detailed discussion of our accounting policies see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues are recognized as services are completed or as product title is transferred  usually when delivery occurs 
all advance client payments are classified as unearned revenues until services are completed or as product title is transferred 
we recognize revenue consistent with the guidance set forth in the securities and exchange commission s sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 sab  as amended by sab a and b 
if there is any change in or to the underlying assumptions we follow as prescribed by sab such as whether i persuasive evidence an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services rendered  iii the fee is fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured  then it could have a material adverse effect upon our financial position and results of operations 
we account for our goodwill and other intangibles based on the financial accounting standards board s fasb s statement of financial accounting standard sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
effective january   we will account for goodwill and other intangible assets based on sfas goodwill and other intangible assets which requires that goodwill is no longer amortized but tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the measurement of possible impairment is based primarily on the ability to recover the balance of the related asset from expected future operating cash flows on an undiscounted basis 
if the underlying assumptions we follow change  our conclusions relating to whether or not an impairment exists could change 
any resulting impairment loss could result in a material adverse effect upon our financial position and results of operations 
our valuation reserve for inventory is based on historical data  and various assumptions and judgments 
should these assumptions and judgments not come to fruition our valuation would change 
the industry we operate in is characterized by rapid technological change and new product development that could result in an increase in obsolete inventory 
our valuation reserve for inventory at december  was million compared to million at december  if we over or underestimate demand for inventory  it could result in a material adverse effect upon our financial position and results of operations 
our income tax expense includes income taxes of the netherlands  us and other foreign countries as well as local  state and provincial income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets or liabilities for the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates at the end of the period 
the valuation allowance recorded is based on estimates and assumptions of taxable income into the future and a determination is made of the magnitude of deferred tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   we had recorded approximately million of valuation allowances related to our net deferred tax assets 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets which could result in a material adverse effect upon our financial position and results of operations 
business core laboratories was established in and is currently traded on the new york stock exchange 
we provide our products and services to the world s major  national and independent oil companies 
our specialty services and products are designed to improve oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields through the following business segments o reservoir description encompasses the characterization of petroleum reservoir rock  fluid and gas samples 
we provide analytical and field services to characterize properties of crude oil and petroleum products to the oil and gas industry 
o production enhancement includes products and services relating to reservoir well completions  perforations  stimulations and production 
we provide integrated services to evaluate the effectiveness of well completions and to develop solutions aimed at increasing the effectiveness of enhanced oil recovery projects 
o reservoir management combines and integrates information from reservoir description and production enhancement services to increase production and improve recovery of oil and gas from our clients reservoirs 
we plan to continue the expansion of our operations through i continuing the development of proprietary technologies through client driven research and development  ii expanding the services and products offered throughout our global network of offices and iii acquiring complementary businesses that add key technologies or market presence and enhance existing products and services 
we continued to pursue our acquisition strategy  as illustrated by our most recent acquisition of promore 
we have also acquired assets beneficial to our growth strategy from gris gun 
in addition  we believe that we have positioned ourselves for increased profitability by restructuring certain operations and creating operating efficiencies within our manufacturing divisions 
results of operations our revenues are derived from services and product sales 
strong demand for our services led to revenue growth of to million in compared to million in with activity levels higher than in previous years  our reservoir optimization services were in higher demand 
these increases were primarily derived from an increase in activity levels in the first half of in north america for our production enhancement projects 
service revenue in increased by million from million in this excluded revenues of million attributable to our environmental testing assets  which were disposed of in the third quarter of the increase in service revenues in reflected a recovery from the depressed market conditions in 
service revenue and cost of service graph 
costs of services in were million  an increase of million as compared to cost of services in decreased million from million in costs of services expressed as a percentage of service revenue were in and in and in and again in we took actions to reduce our cost structure including personnel reductions and office consolidations 
we realized improved service margins as a result of the restructuring charge and anticipate further improvements on our service margins related to the actions taken in decreased sales demand led to a decline in sales revenue of to million in compared to million in the decrease was primarily a result of the lower levels of north america natural gas related activity by our customers 
sales revenue in increased by million from million in increased spending for well completion and stimulation technologies primarily drove the increase in sales revenues in 
sales revenue and cost of sales graph 
costs of sales in were million  a decrease of million as compared to costs of sales in increased million from million in costs of sales expressed as a percentage of sales revenues were in  in and in in  in an effort to improve manufacturing efficiencies  we recorded expenses in cost of sales of approximately million for several initiatives 
these initiatives were implemented in the fourth quarter whereby certain processes and business practices were evaluated and improvements were made 
general and administrative expenses are comprised of corporate management and centralized administrative services which benefit our operating subsidiaries 
general and administrative expenses are typically fixed in nature and are measured in relation to sales 
in  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were as compared to in  which is an increase of 
general and administrative expenses increased million in as compared to in  general and administrative expenses increased million as compared to the increase in both years was attributable to the number of people necessary to support the growth in our operations 
general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues remained below for all periods 
depreciation and amortization expense for increased million as compared to in we had a decrease in depreciation of million as compared to the increased depreciation expense in was partially attributable to the capital expenditures of million and a full year of depreciation for the million of capital expenditures in the prior year 
the decrease in as compared to was due primarily to the sale of our environmental testing business  the effect of asset retirements and the effect of assets which had become fully depreciated 
amortization of goodwill in was million and million in and upon adoption of sfas in  we will no longer amortize goodwill  but instead will test for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded write offs and other charges of million 
these charges were comprised of inventory write downs of million  charges of million to write fixed assets down to their fair value  and other costs of million to migrate data from legacy computer systems to a global information system database 
also  during the fourth quarter of we had several transactions which impacted certain operations that were not viewed as ongoing 
we restructured certain operations in mexico  the uk  the uk and other countries to improve operating efficiencies 
this restructuring expense included write offs of assets and leasehold improvements  and an accrual for facility restoration  severance benefits and lease termination costs 
approximately field employees were terminated 
during  we intend to relocate one of our operations from dallas to the houston advanced technology center and another facility from mexico city  mexico to villahermosa  mexico 
this charge of approximately million affected each of our operating segments as follows reservoir description million  production enhancement million  reservoir management million 
substantially all employee terminations will be completed by the end of the first quarter of total cash required for this restructuring charge of million will be funded from operating activities 
cash required for the costs incurred through december  was million 
this charge is summarized in the following table restructuring charges dollars in thousands lease asset obligations severance restoration write offs other total total restructuring charges  less costs incurred through december   accrual remaining  the fixed assets and leasehold improvements were disposed of by the end of december the write off approximates the carrying amount as these assets were abandoned or sold for salvage value 
depreciation expense was reduced by approximately in  and will be reduced by in and thereafter 
the asset write offs of were attributable to the reservoir management segment 
in the first quarter of  we recorded write offs and other charges totaling million 
this amount included million of asset write offs  million related to facility closures and personnel reductions and million associated with the termination of the proposed acquisition of geoscience corp 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge to cover the cost of exiting redundant facilities and restructuring certain of our operations 
this charge affected each of our operating segments as follows reservoir description million  production enhancement million  reservoir management million 
interest expense for was million  a decrease of approximately million as compared to  after an additional decrease of million compared to the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to lower borrowing costs 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate to in from in and in reflects the relative increase in international earnings taxed at rates lower than the netherlands statutory rate

restructuring charges primarily relating to the reservoir management segment 
included in cost of services and sales are charges of  relating to manufacturing efficiency initiatives incurred in the fourth quarter of segment analysis our operations are managed primarily in three complementary segments reservoir description  production enhancement and reservoir management

improved market conditions in the middle east  venezuela and asia pacific also contributed to the revenue growth 
revenues for were million  an increase of compared to revenues after excluding the revenues attributable to our environmental testing assets  which were sold in when revenues attributable to our environmental testing assets are included in  this segment s revenues decreased by

income before interest  taxes and unusual charges in increased million as compared to reduced operating costs in the us due to the consolidation of businesses in late became fully realized in we experienced an increase of million in as compared to our margins in this segment came under pressure in as our clients reduced spending in response to lower oil and gas prices 
production enhancement production enhancement revenues for were million  an increase of compared to revenues 
the introduction of two new services  packscan tm and completion profiler tm  contributed to the increase in revenue 
in addition  we increased canadian market penetration with proprietary perforating charges and gun systems 
the rate of growth slowed in compared to due to the slowdown in activity levels by our clients in the north american natural gas markets 
revenues for were million  an increase of as compared to revenues 

production enhancement revenue graph 
income before interest  taxes and unusual charges in remained virtually unchanged as compared to in  in an effort to improve manufacturing efficiencies  we recorded expense in cost of sales of approximately million for several initiatives 
these initiatives were implemented in the fourth quarter whereby certain processes and business practices were evaluated and improvements were made 
these costs were offset by income increases due to new initiatives with our downhole completion technologies and incremental margins on fracture diagnostic and field flood monitoring services 
in  we experienced an increase of million as compared to as the introduction of new services and products in our production enhancement segment increased 
reservoir management reservoir management revenues for were million  an increase of compared to revenues 
this increase was attributable to the new technologies derived from our acquisition of promore 
revenues for were million  a decrease of compared to revenues 
demand for our geophysical related services was weak across most regions

although the loss before interest  taxes and unusual charges improved in compared to  we still experienced a loss of million in  compared to a loss of million in we recorded a restructuring charge of million during to reflect our costs to restructure and refocus this segment of our business 
beginning in certain facilities were downsized or closed  causing our workforce in this segment to be reduced by from the highest levels in we have taken and will continue to take actions  including  but not limited to  employee terminations and facility consolidations  when appropriate  to control our costs and generate additional service revenues in order to improve our results in this segment 
we experienced a loss of million in liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our activities through cash flows from operations  bank credit facilities  equity financing and the issuance of debt 
during the year ended december   cash flows from operating activities were million  an increase of million and million from the corresponding periods in and  respectively 
the increase from was partially related to improved receivable turnover while the increase compared to resulted from higher relative margins 
at december   we had working capital of million compared to working capital of million at december  and million at december  we are a netherlands holding company and we conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries 
consequently  our cash flow is dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or otherwise distribute or advance funds to us 
our financing activities provided million in  a decrease of million compared to while financing activities used million  primarily due to a net reduction in borrowings 
our investing activities used million in compared to using million in while investing activities provided million  primarily due to proceeds from the sale of our environmental testing assets 
the significant financing and investing activities in were as follows o we incurred capital expenditures from operations of million which was primarily due to investments made in instruments  tools  computers and facilities in all of our business segments 
o our total borrowings under our credit facility were approximately million  while payments on the credit facility were approximately million 
o we acquired gris gun for approximately million in cash 
we maintain financial flexibility through our million credit facility of which million was available at december  in addition  we have senior notes  which bear interest at an average interest rate of 
the senior notes require semi annual interest payments  interest payments on the credit facility are made based on the interest period selected 
we are subject to certain covenants under the terms of the credit facility and senior notes and we believe that we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december  our ability to maintain and grow our operating income and cash flow is dependent upon continued capital spending 
we believe our future cash flow from operations  supplemented  if necessary  by our borrowing capacity and issuances of additional equity should be sufficient to fund debt requirements  capital expenditures  working capital and future acquisitions 
due to the low inflationary rates in  and  the impact of inflation on our results of operations was insignificant 
accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued two statements  sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  that amend accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 business combinations  and supersede apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
sfas eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations and establishes the purchase method of accounting as the only acceptable method on all business combinations initiated after june  five of our recent acquisitions were accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting 
goodwill resulting from a business combination after june  is to be recognized as an asset but not amortized  while goodwill existing at june  was amortized through december  beginning january   we will no longer amortize goodwill but will test for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
under the requirements  we expect to reflect impairment of goodwill of approximately million as a result of adoption of this standard on january  this impairment will be reflected in the statement of income as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the cessation of goodwill amortization under the guidelines will result in a reduction of approximately million in annual operating expenses  assuming no additional impairment of goodwill 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas requires that the fair value of a liability associated with an asset retirement be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and subsequently depreciated over the life of the asset 
sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material adverse effect upon our financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas provides updated guidance concerning the recognition and measurement of an impairment loss for certain types of long lived assets and modifies the accounting and reporting of discontinued operations 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material adverse effect upon our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf staff issued announcement topic d  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
as a result  customer reimbursements  including those relating to travel and other out of pocket expenses  and other similar third party costs  will be required to be included as revenues effective january   and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses will be included in expenses 
we do not expect eitf topic d to have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
outlook we have established internal earnings targets that are based on current market conditions 
we anticipate north american spending by our clients to decline from levels and international markets to remain at or below levels in response to lower crude oil prices 
we expect the spending levels of our clients to increase in the second half of we expect to meet ongoing working capital and capital expenditure requirements from a combination of cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
forward looking statements this discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  concerning among other things  our expected revenues  expenses and profit  our prospects  and business strategies and development  all of which are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
we based our statements on our current expectations  estimates  historical trends  current conditions and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances 
such statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties related to the oil and gas industry  business conditions  international markets  international political climates and other factors that are beyond our control 
we caution you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance 
accordingly  our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we express or forecast in the forward looking statements 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should our underlying assumptions prove incorrect  our actual results may vary materially from those expected  estimated or projected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risk  which is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
we do not enter  or intend to enter  into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we do not believe that our exposure to market risks  which are primarily related to interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  are material 
during  we issued fixed rate senior notes denominated in us dollars 
the proceeds were used to pay off variable rate term loans 
this significantly reduced our exposure to market risk 
this section should be read in conjunction with note long term debt and note concentration of credit risk of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our credit facility debt which carries a variable interest rate 
at december   our variable rate debt outstanding of million approximated its fair value 
a one percent change in the interest rate would not cause a material change in interest expense on an annual basis 
we attempt to balance the benefit of variable rate debt that has inherent increased risk with fixed rate debt that has less market risk
