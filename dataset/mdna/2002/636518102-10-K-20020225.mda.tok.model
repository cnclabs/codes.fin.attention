item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion in this document contains trend analysis and other forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements throughout this document as a result of a number of important factors 
for a discussion of important factors that could affect the company s results  please refer to the risk factors set forth below in factors affecting the company s business  in the financial line item discussions below and elsewhere in this document 
overview national instruments corporation designs  develops  manufactures and markets instrumentation and automation software and hardware for general commercial  industrial and scientific applications 
the company offers hundreds of products used to create virtual instrumentation systems for measurement and automation 
the company has identified a large and diverse market for test and measurement t m and industrial automation ia applications 
the company s products are used in a variety of applications from research and development to production testing  monitoring and industrial control 
in test and measurement applications  the company s products can be used to monitor and control traditional instruments or to create computer based instruments that can replace traditional instruments 
in industrial automation applications  the company s products can be used in the same ways as in test and measurement and can also be used to integrate measurement functionality with process automation capabilities 
the company sells to a large number of customers in a wide variety of industries 
no single customer accounted for more than of the company s sales in  or the company has been profitable in every year since however  there can be no assurance that the company s net sales will grow or that the company will remain profitable in future periods 
as a result  the company believes historical results of operations should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by certain items reflected in the company s consolidated statements of income years ended december  net sales north america europe asia pacific consolidated net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating income other income expense interest income interest expense net foreign exchange loss income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change provision for income taxes income before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax net income net sales 
in  net sales for the company s products were million  a decrease from the level achieved in  which followed an increase in net sales of in over the level achieved in the company believes the decrease in sales in is primarily attributable to the approximate decline in the sales of certain hardware products that are used to control traditional instruments  which resulted from the worsening of the industrial economy and the severe deterioration of sales of traditional instruments by other vendors used in test and measurement applications 
in  the sales of hardware products that are used to control traditional instruments represented of revenue compared to in and in north american revenue was million in  a decrease of from  following a increase in over the company believes the decrease in sales and in the revenue growth rate in north america in is primarily attributable to the decrease in sales of the company s hardware products that are used to control traditional instruments as a result of the downturn in the test and measurement market 
this downturn was most significant in sales to customers in the telecommunications  instrumentation and semiconductor capital equipment industries 
european revenue was million in  a decrease of from  following a increase in from asia pacific revenue grew to million in  which followed a increase in over levels 
the company believes the decrease in revenue in europe  and the decrease in the revenue growth rate in asia pacific in is primarily attributable to the decrease in sales of the company s hardware products that are used to control traditional instruments  the result of the downturn in the industrial economy  and the strengthening of the us dollar 
see the discussion below for more information concerning the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on sales growth 
international sales sales to customers outside of north america accounted for  and of the company s consolidated net sales for  and  respectively 
the company intends to continue to expand its international operations by increasing its presence in existing markets  add a market presence in some additional geographical markets and continue to use distributors to sell its products in some countries 
sales made by the company s direct sales offices in europe and asia pacific are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  the us dollar equivalent of these sales is affected by changes in the weighted average value of the us dollar 
this weighted average is calculated as the percentage change in the value of the currency relative to the us dollar  multiplied by the proportion of international sales recorded in the particular currency 
between and  this weighted average value of the us dollar increased by  causing an equivalent decrease in the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency sales and expenses 
if the weighted average value of the us dollar during had been the same as that in  on a pro forma basis  the company s sales for would have decreased by 
pro forma european sales for would have increased by over sales 
pro forma asia pacific sales for would have increased by over sales 
if the weighted average value of the us dollar during had been the same as that in  on a pro forma basis  the company s consolidated operating expenses would have been million  representing an increase of million 
the preceding pro forma amounts and percentages are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles but are presented for comparative purposes 
gross profit 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit represented  and in  and  respectively 
the relatively high software content of the company s products is demonstrated in the gross margins achieved by the company 
in  approximately of the lower margin is attributable to reduced sales volume  with the remaining fraction of the lower margin primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates 
there can be no assurance that the company will maintain its historical margins 
the company established a new manufacturing facility in hungary in the forth quarter of the company believes its current manufacturing capacity is adequate to meet current needs 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense in decreased from  which followed an increase of in from the decrease in the expense in is attributable to decreases in travel  advertising and literature costs and special event activities 
sales and marketing personnel increased by during from  at december  to  at december  sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue was in  up from in and in the company expects sales and marketing expenses in future periods to increase in absolute dollars  and to fluctuate as a percentage of sales based on recruiting  initial marketing and advertising campaign costs associated with major new product releases and entry into new market areas  investment in web sales and marketing efforts  increasing product demonstration costs and the timing of domestic and international conferences and trade shows 
research and development 
research and development expense in increased compared to following an increase of in over excluding the pre tax charge for the write off of in process research and development  on a pro forma basis  research and development expense grew and during and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s acquisitions 
the increase in research and development expenditures in absolute amounts in each period was primarily due to increases in personnel costs from hiring of additional product development engineers 
research and development personnel increased from at december  to at december  the company plans to continue making a significant investment in research and development in order to remain competitive 
the company capitalizes software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
the company amortizes such costs over the related product s estimated economic useful life  generally three years  beginning when a product becomes available for general release 
software amortization expense totaled million  million and million during  and  respectively 
software development costs capitalized during such years were million  million and million  respectively 
the significant items capitalized in were primarily the result of labview  measurement studio and teststand the increased levels of capitalization for were primarily a result of the development of labview i  ni daq and max see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of intangibles 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in decreased from  which followed an increase of in from a significant amount of the decrease was due to reduced intellectual property defense costs  the result of the net recovery of million of intellectual property defense costs accrued in the prior year  and to operational efficiencies resulting from continued systems improvement 
implementation of information systems to support the hungarian manufacturing facility  upgrading its worldwide business applications suite to oracle s latest web based release i and continued investment in the company s web presence were the main areas of focus for investment in the information systems department in the decrease followed a increase in which was primarily driven by continued development of web and e commerce offerings and a million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of for defending our intellectual property 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to during from in the decrease in was primarily due to the recovery of million in of the million accrual for future intellectual property defense costs recorded in the fourth quarter of the company expects that general and administrative costs will increase in absolute amounts and will fluctuate as a percentage of revenue as the company continues to invest in maintaining its existing systems  developing the infrastructure for the new hungarian manufacturing facility  and developing web based commerce and management information systems 
interest income and expense 
interest income decreased in from  which followed an increase of in from the decrease in interest income in was primarily due to lower yields on the company s investments 
the primary source of interest income is from the investment of the company s cash 
net cash provided by operating activities in totaled million 
interest expense decreased in  the result of full repayment of debt outstanding in net foreign exchange gain loss 
the company experienced net foreign exchange losses of million in  compared to losses of million in and gains of  in these results are attributable to movements between the us dollar and the local currencies in countries in which the company s sales subsidiaries are located 
the company recognizes the local currency as the functional currency of its international subsidiaries 
the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a majority of its foreign currency denominated receivables in order to reduce its exposure to significant foreign currency fluctuations 
the company typically limits the duration of its receivables foreign currency forward contracts to days 
the company also utilizes foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency purchased option contracts in order to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in future foreign currency cash flows 
the company purchases these contracts for up to of its forecasted cash flows in selected currencies primarily the euro and yen and limits the duration of these contracts to months 
the foreign currency purchased option contracts are purchased at the money or out of the money 
as a result  the company s hedging activities only partially address its risks in foreign currency transactions  and there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
the company does not invest in contracts for speculative purposes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s forward and purchased option contracts and hedged positions 
the company s hedging strategy reduced the foreign exchange loss for december  by million and reduced the net foreign exchange loss for december  by million 
effective january   the company elected to adopt sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
see note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of in  and the effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of tax exempt interest and the benefit of the company s foreign sales corporation 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations 
at december   the company had working capital of approximately million compared to million at december accounts receivable decreased to million at december  from million at december   as a result of lower sales levels and improved collections 
receivable days outstanding at december  decreased to days from days at december  consolidated inventory balances have decreased to million at december  from million at december  inventory turns of per year for represent a decrease from turns of per year for and reflect the decrease in sales from the prior year 
cash used for investing activities in includes million for the purchase of property and equipment and capitalization of software development costs of million 
in october of  the company began construction of an office building mopac c located on the north austin campus 
it is currently anticipated that a significant portion of the construction costs will be paid out of the company s existing working capital 
the company estimates the total cost for the new building  including furniture  fixtures and equipment  will range from million to million 
in october of  the company entered into firm commitments of approximately million for the new building 
the company has incurred approximately million in construction costs as of december   with the remainder becoming payable in the actual level of spending may vary depending on a variety of factors  including unforeseen difficulties in construction 
upon completion of the mopac c building  the company intends to vacate its existing  sq 
ft 
millenium office building 
the company has signed an agreement to lease the millenium building to a third party and currently estimates that the net rental income from this lease will offset approximately of the projected operating costs from the mopac c building 
during  the company completed construction of a second manufacturing facility located in hungary 
this european manufacturing facility became operational in the forth quarter of  and the company estimates that by the facility will source a significant portion of the company s sales 
the location of the facility has a cost base and tax rate significantly lower than in the us  which should have the effect of reducing the cost of manufacturing and lowering the consolidated tax rate 
however  there can be no assurance that the actual manufacturing costs and tax rates will be lower 
the total cost for the new facility  including furniture  fixtures and equipment  was approximately million 
the company currently expects to fund expenditures for capital requirements as well as liquidity needs created by changes in working capital from a combination of available cash and short term investment balances and internally generated funds 
the company estimates that its budgeted capital expenditures over the next fiscal year will be approximately million 
as of december   the company had no debt outstanding to financial institutions 
the company believes that the cash flow from operations  if any  existing cash balances and short term investments  will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months depend on the company s profitability  its ability to manage working capital requirements and its rate of growth 
financial risk management the company s international sales are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in local economies  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in the repatriation of earnings and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
the company s sales outside of north america are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  the company is subject to the risks associated with fluctuations in currency rates 
in particular  increases in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies decrease the us dollar value of foreign sales requiring the company either to increase its price in the local currency  which could render the company s product prices noncompetitive  or to suffer reduced revenues and gross margins as measured in us dollars 
these dynamics have adversely affected revenue growth in international markets in and in previous years 
the company s foreign currency hedging program includes both foreign currency forward and purchased option contracts to reduce the effect of exchange rate fluctuations 
however  the hedging program will not eliminate all of the company s foreign exchange risks 
see net foreign exchange gain loss and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the marketplace for the company s products dictates that many of the company s products be shipped very quickly after an order is received 
as a result  the company is required to maintain significant inventories 
therefore  inventory obsolescence is a risk for the company due to frequent engineering changes  shifting customer demand  the emergence of new industry standards and rapid technological advances including the introduction by the company or its competitors of products embodying new technology 
while the company maintains valuation allowances for excess and obsolete inventory and management continues to monitor the adequacy of such valuation allowances  there can be no assurance that such valuation allowances will be sufficient 
the company has no debt or off balance sheet debt 
as of december   the company has non cancelable operating lease obligations of approximately million and contractual purchase commitments with various suppliers of general components and customized inventory and components of approximately million 
as of december   the company has outstanding guarantees for payment of foreign operating leases  customs and foreign grants totaling approximately million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  the company is not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if the company were engaged in such relationships 
market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of its investments 
in the normal course of business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and changes in the market value of its investments 
foreign currency hedging activities 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in such exchange rates on the company s earnings and cash flow 
accordingly  the company utilizes purchased foreign currency option contracts and forward contracts to hedge its exposure on anticipated transactions and firm commitments 
the principal currencies hedged are the euro  british pound and japanese yen 
the company monitors its foreign exchange exposures regularly to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions 
however  there can be no assurance the company s foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its results of operations and financial position 
based on the foreign exchange instruments outstanding at december   an adverse change defined as in the asian currencies and in all other currencies in exchange rates would result in a decline in the aggregate fair market value of all instruments outstanding of approximately million 
however  as the company utilizes foreign currency instruments for hedging anticipated and firmly committed transactions  management believes that a loss in fair value for those instruments will be substantially offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s financial instruments at december  and short term investments 
the fair value of the company s investments in marketable securities at december  was million 
the company s investment policy is to manage its investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds 
the company diversifies the marketable securities portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities 
the company s investment portfolio is primarily invested in short term securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds 
based on the company s investment portfolio and interest rates at december   a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease or increase of approximately  respectively  in the fair value of the investment portfolio 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the investment portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations except for qualifying business combinations that were initiated prior to july  the purchase method of accounting is required to be used for all the business combinations initiated after june  sfas no

in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
 discontinues amortization of acquired goodwill and instead requires annual impairment testing 
separable intangible assets will be amortized over their useful economic lives and tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of 
intangible assets with an indefinite useful economic life will not be amortized until the life of the asset is determined to be finite 
for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets acquired prior to july   amortization will continue until adoption of sfas no 
at which time amortization will cease and a transitional impairment test will be performed 
any impairment charges resulting from the initial application of the new rules will be classified as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective january  as of december   the company had net goodwill of approximately million and related amortization expense of goodwill of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on the company s financial position or future results of operations 
also in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no

in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes previous guidance for financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for segments of a business to be disposed of 
the company adopted sfas no 
on january  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have an impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policies are as follows o revenue recognition revenue from the sale and licensing of products is recognized on the date the product is shipped to the customer 
revenue related to the sale of maintenance contracts is deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the service period 
o estimating allowances  specifically sales returns  the allowance for doubtful accounts and allowance for excess and obsolete inventory the preparation of financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  the company must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
the allowance for sales returns was million at december  material differences may result in the amount and timing of the company s revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
similarly  our management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based on assumptions on future demands and market conditions 
the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was million at december  if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
o accounting for costs of computer software the company capitalizes costs related to the development and acquisition of certain software products 
capitalization of costs begins when technological feasibility has been established and ends when the product is available for general release to customers 
amortization is computed on an individual product basis for those products available for market and has been recognized based on the product s estimated economic life  generally three years 
at each balance sheet date  the unamortized costs are reviewed by management and reduced to net realized value when necessary 
as of december   unamortized capitalized software development costs was million 
o valuation of long lived and intangible assets the company assesses the impairement of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following o significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  o significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  o significant negative industry or economic trends  o the company s market capitalization relative to net book value 
when it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the measurement of any impairment is determined and the carrying value is reduced as appropriate 
as of december   the company had net goodwill of approximately million 
factors affecting the company s business us global economic slowdown 
as occurred in when the worsening of the industrial economy resulted in a deterioration of the test and measurement market  the markets in which the company does business could again experience the negative effects of a slowdown in the us and or global economies 
downturns in the us or global economies could result in reduced purchasing and capital spending in any of the markets served by the company which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
budgets 
the company has established an operating budget for the company s spending for could exceed this budget due to a number of factors  including additional marketing costs for any unplanned conferences and tradeshows  increased costs from the over hiring of product development engineers or other personnel  increased manufacturing costs resulting from component supply shortages and or component price fluctuations  additional construction costs and or delays in the construction of the mopac c office building  failure of a third party tenant to pay rent for leased office space and or additional litigation expenses related to intellectual property litigation 
any future decreased demand for our products could result in decreased revenue and could require the company to revise its budget and reduce expenditures 
exceeding the established operating budget or failing to revise its budget in response to any decrease in our revenue could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
risk of component shortages 
as has occurred in the past  most recently in the quarter ended march   and as may be expected to occur in the future  supply shortages of components including sole source components can result in significant additional costs and inefficiencies in manufacturing 
if the company is unsuccessful in resolving any such component shortages  it will experience a significant impact on the timing of revenue and or an increase in manufacturing costs  either of which would have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company s quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including changes in the mix of products sold  the availability and pricing of components from third parties especially sole sources  the timing of orders  level of pricing of international sales  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the difficulty in maintaining margins  including the higher margins traditionally achieved in international sales  and changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or suppliers 
specifically  if the local currencies in which the company sells weaken against the us dollar  and if the local sales prices cannot be raised  the company will experience a deterioration of its gross and net profit margins 
the company expects the strength of the us dollar to have a negative effect on gross and net profit margins in future quarters 
as has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future  new software products of the company or new operating systems of third parties on which the company s products are based  often contain bugs or errors that can result in reduced sales and or cause the company s support costs to increase  either of which could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
furthermore  the company has significant revenues from customers in industries such as semiconductors  automated test equipment  telecommunications  aerospace  defense and automotive which are cyclical in nature 
downturns in these industries could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
new product introductions and market acceptance 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs and frequent new product introductions  and is therefore highly dependent upon timely product innovation 
the company s success is dependent in part on its ability to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis to replace declining revenues from older products  and on increasing penetration in domestic and international markets 
in the past  the company has experienced significant delays between the announcement and the commercial availability of new products 
any significant delay in releasing new products could have a material adverse effect on the ultimate success of a product and other related products and could impede continued sales of predecessor products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to introduce new products in accordance with announced release dates  that new products will achieve market acceptance or that any such acceptance will be sustained for any significant period 
failure of new products to achieve or sustain market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company s international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with the company s efforts to increase foreign market penetration 
risks associated with increased development of web site 
the company has devoted significant resources in developing its web site as a key marketing and sales tool and expects to continue to do so in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its attempt to leverage the web to increase sales 
the company hosts its web site internally 
failure to successfully maintain the web site and to protect it from hackers could have a significant impact on the company s results 
operation in intensely competitive markets 
the markets in which the company operates are characterized by intense competition from numerous competitors  some of which are divisions of large corporations having far greater resources than the company  and the company expects to face further competition from new market entrants in the future 
a key competitor is agilent technologies inc agilent 
agilent offers its own line of instrument controllers  and also offers hardware and software add on products for third party desktop computers and workstations that provide solutions that directly compete with the company s virtual instrumentation products 
agilent is aggressively advertising and marketing products that are competitive with the company s products 
because of agilent s strong position in the instrumentation business  changes in its marketing strategy or product offerings could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company believes its ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside its control  including new product introductions by competitors  product pricing  quality and performance  success in developing new products  adequate manufacturing capacity and supply of components and materials  efficiency of manufacturing operations  effectiveness of sales and marketing resources and strategies  strategic relationships with other suppliers  timing of new product introductions by the company  protection of the company s products by effective use of intellectual property laws  general market and economic conditions  and government actions throughout the world 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future 
management information systems 
during  the company devoted significant resources to implementing information systems to support its new manufacturing facility in europe 
the company also devoted significant resources to the evaluation and development of an advanced planning system for manufacturing and to continued development of web offerings 
on january   the company implemented i factory planner  an advanced manufacturing planning system for enhanced predictability of material flow in its manufacturing operation 
the company is currently monitoring the effects of this newly implemented system on its inventory levels  manufacturing efficiency and backlog 
if the effect on inventory levels and material flow is adverse  it could result in the company having to attempt to revert back to its predecessor system of material flow planning 
if the effect of the new i planning system is adverse and if the company is unable to re implement its previous planning system in a timely manner  it could impact the company s future product shipments and revenues which accordingly could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations 
in  the company will also be focusing on upgrading its japanese office s business applications suite to oracle s latest web based release i  and will continue to devote significant resources to the development of the web 
failure to successfully implement these initiatives could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations 
the company relies on three primary regional centers for its management information systems 
as with any information system  unforeseen issues may arise that could affect management s ability to receive adequate  accurate and timely financial information  which in turn could inhibit effective and timely decisions 
furthermore  it is possible that one or more of the company s three regional information systems could experience a complete or partial shutdown 
if such a shutdown occurred near the end of a quarter it could impact the company s product shipments and revenues  as product distribution is heavily dependent on the integrated management information systems in each region 
accordingly  operating results in that quarter would be adversely impacted due to the shipments  which would not occur until following periods 
the company is working to achieve reliable regional management information systems to control costs and improve the ability to deliver its products in substantially all of its direct markets worldwide 
no assurance can be given that the company s efforts will be successful 
the failure to receive adequate  accurate and timely financial information could inhibit management s ability to make effective and timely decisions 
risks associated with international operations and foreign economies 
international sales are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in local economies  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in the repatriation of earnings and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
the company must also comply with various export regulations 
failure to ensure compliance with these regulations could result in fines and or termination of export licenses  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
additionally  the regulatory environment in some countries is very restrictive as their governments try to protect their local economy and value of their local currency against the us dollar 
sales made by the company s international direct sales offices are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  the us dollar equivalent of these sales is affected by changes in the weighted average value of the us dollar 
this weighted average is calculated as the percentage change in the value of the currency relative to the dollar  multiplied by the proportion of international sales recorded in the particular currency 
between and  the weighted average value of the us dollar increased by  causing an equivalent decrease in the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency sales and expenses 
if the weighted average value during had been the same as that in  the company s sales for would have decreased by 
if the weighted average value during had been the same as that in  the company s consolidated operating expenses would have been million  representing an increase of million 
if the us dollar strengthens again in the future  it could have a materially adverse effect on the operating results of the company 
as of december   the company has million of deferred gains on yen foreign currency cash flow hedge contracts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income that are expected to be reclassified into earnings over the next months 
if the yen fails to strengthen before the expiration of these contracts  and if the company is unable to increase prices in japan and or globally  the company will experience a deterioration of revenue and gross and net profit margins  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
expansion of manufacturing capacity 
during  the company completed construction of a second manufacturing facility 
this facility is located in hungary and became operational in the fourth quarter of the company estimates that by  this facility will source a significant portion of the company s sales 
currently the company is continuing to recruit and train the local work force and is continuing to develop and implement information systems to support its operation 
this facility and its operation are also subject to risks associated with a new manufacturing facility and with doing business internationally  including difficulty in managing manufacturing operations in a foreign country  difficulty in achieving or maintaining product quality  interruption to transportation flows for delivery of components to us and finished goods to our customers  and changes in the country s political or economic conditions 
no assurance can be given that the company s efforts will be successful 
accordingly  failure to deal with these factors could result in interruption in the facility s operation or delays in expanding its capacity  either of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
products dependent on certain industries 
the company s products are dependent on customers in certain industries  particularly the telecommunications  semiconductor  automotive  automated test equipment  defense and aerospace industries 
as has occurred in the past  most recently in the quarter ended december   and as may be expected to occur in the future  downturns characterized by diminished product demand in any one or more of these industries could result in decreased sales  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
dependence on key suppliers

truchard and other members of senior management and key technical personnel 
the company has no agreements providing for the employment of any of its key employees for any fixed term and the company s key employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with the company at any time 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s key employees in the future could have a material adverse affect on operating results

in addition  the recruiting environment for software engineering  sales and other technical professionals is very competitive
