the higher torrid markdowns were related to minimum purchases of merchandise required in excess of what was needed for the small store base

the decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to leveraging administrative expenses over the greater sales base in fiscal and lower store operating expenses resulting from management s efforts to control such expenses

quarterly results and seasonality the company s quarterly results of operations may fluctuate materially depending on  among other things  the timing of store openings and related pre opening and other startup expenses  net sales contributed by new stores  increases or decreases in comparable store sales  releases of new music and music related products  shifts in timing of certain holidays  changes in the company s merchandise mix and overall economic conditions 
the company s business is also subject to seasonal influences  with heavier concentrations of sales during the back to school  halloween and holiday seasons defined as the week of thanksgiving through the first few days of january  and other periods when schools are not in session 
the holiday season remains the company s single most important selling season 
the company believes  however  that the importance of the summer vacation and back to school seasons which affect operating results in the second and third quarters  respectively and to a lesser extent  the spring break season which affects operating results in the first quarter as well as halloween which affects operating results in the third quarter  all reduce the company s dependence on the holiday selling season

the increase in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to the increases in net income  depreciation and amortization  accounts payable  and income taxes payable

torrid stores are planned to be approximately  square feet compared to hot topic stores planned to be approximately  square feet 
the actual costs that the company will incur in connection with opening future stores cannot be predicted with precision because such costs will vary based upon  among other things  geographic location  and the size of the stores and the extent of the build out required at the selected sites

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates estimates  including those related primarily to inventories  long lived assets and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
inventories inventories and related cost of sales are accounted for by the retail method 
the cost of inventory is valued at the lower of average cost or market  on a first in  first out fifo basis  utilizing the retail method 
each month  slow moving or seasonally obsolete merchandise is marked down 
the first markdown is typically to of the original retail 
in cases where the merchandise does not sell after the first markdown  an additional markdown is made in a subsequent month 
any marked down merchandise that does not sell is marked down to a zero value and removed from the store  approximately three months after the original markdown 
in determining the lower of average cost or market value of period ending inventories  consistently applied valuation criteria is used 
consideration is given to a number of quantitative factors  including anticipated subsequent permanent markdowns and aging of inventories 
valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the manner of the use of the asset or a significant negative industry or economic trend 
when the company determines that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the company will measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management 
the company has not historically had an impairment of a long lived asset 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on net sales or results of operations 
the company has generally been able to pass on increased costs related to inflation through increases in selling prices
