item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about the company s industry  management s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management 
all statements  trends  analyses and other information contained in this report relative to trends in net sales  gross margin and anticipated expense levels  as well as other statements  including words such as anticipate  believe  plan  estimate and intend and other similar expressions  constitute forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially from those anticipated or expressed in such statements 
potential risks and uncertainties include  among others  those set forth under the caption factors that may affect future results and financial condition included within this section 
particular attention should be paid to the cautionary statements involving the industry s rapid technological change and exposure to inventory obsolescence  availability and allocations of goods  reliance on vendor support and relationships  competitive risks  pricing risks  and the overall level of economic activity and the level of business investment in information technology products 
except as required by law  the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
readers  however  should carefully review the factors set forth in other reports or documents that the company files from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
significant accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of pc connection are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition revenue on products sales is recognized at the point in time when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and final  delivery has occurred and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we generally obtain oral and written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred at the point of shipment  except for sales to federal agencies  for which delivery occurs at destination 
we provide our customers with a limited thirty day right of return only for defective merchandise 
revenue is recognized at shipment and a reserve for sales returns is recorded 
the company has demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  based on significant historical experience 
should such returns no longer prove to be estimable  we believe that the impact on our financials would not necessarily be significant since the return privilege expires days after shipment 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and customers current credit worthiness 
collections are monitored continuously  and an allowance for estimated doubtful accounts is maintained based on our historical experience and customer collection issues identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations  further deterioration of customers ability to make required payments may make additional allowances necessary 
in addition to accounts receivable from customers  we record receivables from vendors suppliers for cooperative advertising  price protection  supplier reimbursements  rebates and other similar arrangements 
a portion of such receivables is estimated based on information available from our vendors at discrete points in time 
while such estimates have historically approximated actual cash received  an unanticipated change in a promotional program could give rise to a reduction in the receivable 
inventories merchandise inventories all finished goods consisting of software packages  computer systems and peripheral equipment are stated at cost determined under the first in  first out method or market  whichever is lower 
inventory quantities on hand are reviewed regularly  and provisions are made for obsolete  slow moving and nonsalable inventory  based primarily on management s forecast of customer demand for those products in inventory 
the pc industry is characterized by rapid technological change and new product development that could result in increased obsolescence of inventory on hand 
increased obsolescence or decreased customer demand beyond management s expectations could require additional provisions 
recent developments on march   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with moredirect  inc  a florida corporation 
moredirect is an e procurement supplier of information technology products for medium to large corporate and government organizations nationwide 
pursuant to the merger agreement  moredirect will be merged with our newly formed florida merger subsidiary 
following the merger  moredirect will continue its operations as our wholly owned subsidiary under its existing management 
under the terms of the merger agreement  moredirect s stockholders will receive approximately  at closing 
the merger agreement contemplates an earn out period of three years following the closing whereby if moredirect maintains certain earnings before income tax  or ebit  levels  additional payments will be made to moredirect s stockholders 
under the merger agreement  earn out payments are tied to ebit levels targeted to grow at a rate per year 
the maximum payments we will make under the earn out provisions of the merger agreement are  assuming moredirect maintains of targeted ebit levels for all three years 
if moredirect maintains less than of targeted ebit levels for all three years  no payments would be required under the earn out provisions of the merger agreement 
at any time during the earn out period  we may buy out the remaining earn out payments for amounts which vary during the term of the earn out 
we will also escrow  at closing to fund a portion of these contingent payments 
certain portions of the contingent payments may be converted into our common stock at specified conversion prices between and per share 
the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement are subject to the satisfaction of several conditions 
our acquisition of moredirect will be immediately accretive to earnings and will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
general pc connection was founded in as a mail order business offering a broad range of software and accessories for ibm and ibm compatible personal computers 
the founders goal was to provide consumers with superior service and high quality branded products at competitive prices 
we initially sought customers through advertising in selected computer industry publications and the use of inbound toll free telemarketing 
currently  we generate sales through i outbound telemarketing by account managers focused on the business  education and government markets  ii inbound calls from customers responding to our catalogs and other advertising and iii our internet web site 
we offer both pc compatible products and mac compatible products 
reliance on mac product sales has decreased over the last three years  from of net sales for the year ended december  to of net sales for the year ended december  we believe that sales attributable to mac products will continue to decrease as a percentage of net sales and may also decline in absolute dollar volume in and future years 
the weakness in demand for information technology products experienced by us in the fourth quarter of continued through  resulting in overall conservative buying patterns  order deferrals and longer sales cycles 
sales of computer systems result in a relatively high dollar sales order  as reflected in the increase in our average order size from in the year ended december  to  in the year ended december  computer systems generally provide the largest gross profit dollar contribution per order of all our products  although they usually yield the lowest gross margin percentage 
our profit margins are also influenced by  among other things  industry pricing and the relative mix of inbound versus outbound sales 
generally  pricing in the computer and related products market is very aggressive  and we intend to maintain prices at competitive levels 
since outbound sales are typically to corporate accounts that purchase at volume discounts  the gross margin on such sales is generally lower than inbound sales 
however  the gross profit dollar contribution per order is generally higher as average order sizes of orders to corporate accounts are usually larger 
we believe that outbound sales will continue to represent a larger portion of our business mix in future periods 
the direct marketing of personal computers and related products is highly competitive 
in addition to other direct marketers and manufacturers who sell direct  such as dell and gateway  manufacturers of pcs sold by us  such as apple  compaq and ibm  have also implemented varying plans to sell pcs directly to end users 
we currently believe that direct sales by compaq and ibm will not have a significant adverse effect upon our net sales 
most product manufacturers provide us with co op advertising support in exchange for product coverage in our catalogs 
although the level of co op advertising support available to us from certain manufacturers has declined  and may decline further in the future  the overall level of co op advertising programs has remained consistent with our levels of spending for catalog and other advertising programs 
we believe that the overall levels of co op advertising programs available over the next twelve months will be consistent with our planned advertising programs 
for financial reporting purposes  revenue garnered from cooperative advertising services is offset against selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated information derived from our statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 
years ended december  net sales in millions    net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses 
restructuring costs and other special charges income from operations the following table sets forth our percentage of net sales by platform  sales channel  and product mix years ended december  platform pc and multi platform mac total sales channel corporate outbound inbound telesales on line internet total product mix notebooks desktop servers storage devices software networking communications printers video monitors memory accessories other total sales of enterprise server and networking products included in the above product mix were  and of net sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales decreased million  or  to  million in from  million in the decrease in net sales was due to the weakness in demand for information technology products 
outbound sales decreased million  or  to million from  million in while there was an overall decrease in outbound sales  this channel increased as an overall component of our business 
outbound sales increased by as a percentage of overall net sales to in as compared to in inbound sales  which primarily serve our consumer and very small business customers decreased million  or  to million  from million in online internet sales decreased million  or  to million from million in  however online internet sales increased to of total net sales in  as compared to of total net sales in our sales to consumers and small businesses were more negatively impacted during the economic slowdown than were sales to our larger business customers  who generally purchase through either the outbound or internet channels 
we believe that sales to consumers and small businesses will continue to be more heavily impacted than sales to large business customers if the economic slowdown continues 
net sales of enterprise server and networking products decreased to million in as compared to million in enterprise server and networking products represented of overall net sales for the year  up from for the year ended while sales of these products declined in absolute dollar amounts in  we believe that sales of these product categories will continue to grow as a percentage of our net sales as customers further upgrade their network and communication infrastructures 
if economic conditions do not improve in the near term  the anticipated sales growth of these types of products will not likely occur as expected 
as of december   the number of outbound sales account managers totaled  a decrease  compared to account managers at the end of we are focusing on recruiting experienced account managers and increasing the success rate of our existing account managers 
gross profit decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in gross profit dollars was attributable to the decrease in net sales described above 
gross profit margin decreased from in to in due to a more competitive pricing environment  and other market conditions 
our profit margins are also influenced by the relative mix of inbound  outbound and on line internet sales 
our gross margin may vary based upon vendor support programs  product mix  pricing strategies  market conditions and other factors 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in and increased as a percentage of sales to in from in we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses sg a may vary depending on changes in sales volume  as well as the levels of continued investments in key growth initiatives such as hiring more experienced outbound sales account managers  improving marketing programs  and deploying next generation internet web technology to support the sales organization 
restructuring costs and other special charges totaling million  were recorded in the year these costs related to staff reductions of million  and million of costs associated with proposed acquisitions abandoned during the year 
a rollforward of restructuring costs and other special charges for the twelve months ended december  is shown below 
there were no changes in estimates in the interim periods 
total cash liabilities at charges payments december  in thousands workforce reduction   cost associated with abandoned acquisitions income from operations decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in income from operations as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in for the reasons net sales decreased as discussed above 
interest expense decreased by 
million  or  to million in from million in this decrease in interest expense was attributed to lower average borrowings outstanding in as compared to and to lower interest rates 
our effective tax rate was for both and net income decreased by million  or  to million in from million in  principally as a result of the decrease in income from operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased million  or  to  million in from  million in the growth in net sales was attributable to i a continued expansion and increased productivity of our outbound telemarketing group  and ii an increased focus on enterprise server and networking product categories 
as of december   the number of account managers totaled  a increase  compared to account managers at the end of as a result  outbound sales increased million  or  to  million in from million in enterprise networking product sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in gross profit increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in gross profit dollars was attributable to the increase in net sales described above 
gross profit margin increased from in to in due to a continuing focus on solution sales to business  government and educational customers and an increased focus on higher margin enterprise networking products cited above 
our gross margin may vary based upon vendor support programs  product mix  pricing strategies  market conditions and other factors 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in and increased as a percentage of sales to in from in this increase was attributable to increases in sales personnel  bad debt  and facility costs  and offset by a decrease in net advertising expense 
income from operations increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in income from operations as a percentage of net sales increased from in to in for the reasons net sales increased as discussed above 
interest expense increased by 
million  or  to million in from million in due to increased borrowings under our line of credit necessitated by our growth 
interest expense is offset by interest income from short term investments 
our effective tax rate was for both and net income increased by million  or  to million in from million in  principally as a result of the increase in income from operations 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and bank borrowings 
we believe that funds generated from operations  together with available credit under our bank line of credit  will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements at least for the next twelve calendar months 
our ability to continue funding our planned growth  both internally and externally  is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  or from other sources of financing  as may be required 
if demand for information technology products continues to decline  our cash flows from operations may be substantially affected 
see also those risks listed below under factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended december  compared to million used for operating activities and million provided by operating activities for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the primary factors historically affecting cash flows from operations are net income and changes in the levels of accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable 
since accounts receivable and inventories have substantially decreased since december   cash provided by operating activities has increased commensurately 
at december   we had million in outstanding accounts payable 
such accounts are generally paid within days of incurrence and will be financed by cash flows from operations or short term borrowings under the line of credit 
this amount includes million payable to two financial institutions under security agreements to facilitate the purchase of inventory 
we believe we will be able to meet our obligations under our accounts payable with cash flows from operations and our existing line of credit 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect capital expenditures  primarily for the purchase of computer hardware and software and other fixed assets  to be approximately million for the year ending december  we have an unsecured credit agreement with a bank providing for short term borrowings up to million  which bears interest at various rates ranging from the prime rate at december  to prime less  depending on the ratio of senior debt to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the credit agreement includes various customary financial and operating covenants  including restrictions on the payment of dividends  none of which we believe significantly restricts our operations 
the credit agreement matures on may  and we are currently renegotiating the credit agreement 
we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to renegotiate the credit agreement on the same favorable terms as in the current credit agreement 
no borrowings were outstanding at december  under the terms of the merger agreement we entered into with moredirect  we will pay moredirect s stockholders approximately  at closing 
the merger agreement contemplates an earn out period of three years following the closing whereby if moredirect maintains certain earnings before income tax  or ebit  levels  additional payments will be made to moredirect s stockholders 
under the merger agreement  earn out payments are tied to ebit levels targeted to grow at a rate per year 
the maximum payments we will make under the earn out provisions of the merger agreement are  assuming moredirect maintains of targeted ebit levels for all three years 
if moredirect maintains less than of targeted ebit levels for all three years  no payment would be required under the earn out provisions of the merger agreement 
at any time during the earn out period  we may buy out the remaining earn out payments for amounts which vary during the term of the earn out 
we will also escrow  at closing to fund a portion of these contingent payments 
we believe we will be able to meet our obligations to moredirect and its stockholders under the merger agreement 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
less than after december  total year years years in thousands contractual obligations long term debt   capital lease obligation to affiliate   non cancelable operating lease obligations    total contractual obligations     related parties in november  we entered into a fifteen year lease for our corporate headquarters with an affiliated company  g h post  which is related to pc connection through common ownership 
the total lease is valued at approximately million  based upon an independent property appraisal obtained at the date of lease  and interest is calculated at an annual rate of 
the lease requires us to pay our proportionate share of real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges as additional rent and also to pay insurance premiums for the leased property 
we have the option to renew the lease for two additional terms of five years each 
the lease has been recorded as a capital lease in the financial statements 
we have other transactions with affiliate companies including g h  g h post  en technology  and pctv  all related to pc connection through common ownership 
such transactions are determined using the fair market values of such services or products 
year ended december  in thousands revenue sales of various products sales of services to affiliated companies costs purchase of services from affiliated companies 
l recently issued financial accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which will be effective for pc connection on january  sfas requires  among other things  the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill and certain other identified intangibles 
in addition  the statement includes provisions for the reassessment of the value and useful lives of existing recognized intangibles including goodwill  reclassification of certain intangibles both in and out of previously reported goodwill and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill and other intangibles 
we believe that the impact of the adoption of sfas will not be material to the balance sheet 
the company had recorded thousand in amortization relative to goodwill in this amortization will cease in inflation we have historically offset any inflation in operating costs by a combination of increased productivity and price increases  where appropriate 
we do not expect inflation to have a significant impact on our business in the future 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition our future results and financial condition are dependent on our ability to continue to successfully market  sell and distribute information technology products and services  including computers  hardware and software 
inherent in this process are a number of factors that we must successfully manage in order to achieve a favorable financial condition and favorable operating results 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect our future financial condition and operating results include  without limitation  the following factors there has been a recent decrease in demand throughout the industry for the products we sell 
with the events of september  together with the general decline in the economy over the past year  the demand for personal computer products has decreased throughout the industry 
this decrease adversely affected our sales and results of operation in if our net sales do not increase in proportion to our operating expenses or if we experience a decrease in net sales for an extended period of time  there would be a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods 
we have experienced rapid growth in recent years followed by a decline in sales in and there is no assurance that we will be able to regain such growth 
our net sales grew from million for the year ended december  to billion for the year ended december  in the year ended december   our net sales declined to billion 
our growth in previous years placed increasing demands on our administrative  operational  financial and other resources 
our staffing levels and operating expenses increased substantially in recent years due to our sales forecasts 
if our revenues continue to decline  we may not be able to reduce our staffing levels and operating expenses in a timely manner to meet our needs 
moreover  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to regain rapid growth in the near future 
we may also experience quarterly fluctuations and seasonality which could impact our business 
several factors have caused our sales and results of operations to fluctuate and we expect these fluctuations to continue on a quarterly basis 
causes of these fluctuations include 
changes in the overall level of economic activity  
changes in the level of business investment in information technology products  
the condition of the personal computer industry in general  
shifts in customer demand for hardware and software products  
industry shipments of new products or upgrades  
the timing of new merchandise and catalog offerings  
fluctuations in response rates  
fluctuations in postage  paper  shipping and printing costs and in merchandise returns  
adverse weather conditions that affect response  distribution or shipping  
shifts in the timing of holidays  
changes in our product offerings  and 
changes in consumer demand for information technology products 
we base our operating expenditures on sales forecasts 
if revenues do not meet expectations in any given quarter  our operating results could suffer 
in addition  customer response rates for our catalogs and other marketing vehicles are subject to variations 
the first and last quarters of the year generally have higher response rates while the two middle quarters typically have lower response rates 
we are exposed to inventory obsolescence due to the rapid technological changes occurring in the personal computer industry 
the market for personal computer products is characterized by rapid technological change and the frequent introduction of new products and product enhancements 
our success depends in large part on our ability to identify and market products that meet the needs of customers in that marketplace 
in order to satisfy customer demand and to obtain favorable purchasing discounts  we have and may continue to carry increased inventory levels of certain products 
by so doing  we are subject to the increased risk of inventory obsolescence 
also  in order to implement our business strategy  we intend to continue  among other things  to place larger than typical inventory stocking orders  and increase our participation in first to market purchase opportunities 
we may also participate in end of life cycle purchase opportunities and market products on a private label basis  which would increase the risk of inventory obsolescence 
in addition  we sometimes acquire special purchase products without return privileges 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid losses related to obsolete inventory 
in addition  manufacturers are limiting return rights and are also taking steps to reduce their inventory exposure by supporting build to order programs authorizing distributors and resellers to assemble computer hardware under the manufacturers brands 
these trends reduce the costs to manufacturers and shift the burden of inventory risk to resellers like us which could negatively impact our business 
we acquire products for resale from a limited number of vendors  the loss of any one of these vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we acquire products for resale both directly from manufacturers and indirectly through distributors and other sources 
the five vendors supplying the greatest amount of goods to us constituted and of our total product purchases in the years ended december  and  respectively 
among these five vendors  purchases from ingram micro  inc represented and of our total product purchases and purchases from tech data corporation comprised and of our total product purchases in the years ended december  and  respectively 
no other vendor supplied more than of our total product purchases in the year ended december  if we were unable to acquire products from ingram micro or tech data  we could experience a short term disruption in the availability of products and such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
substantially all of our contracts and arrangements with our vendors that supply significant quantities of products are terminable by such vendors or us without notice or upon short notice 
most of our product vendors provide us with trade credit  of which the net amount outstanding at december  was million 
termination  interruption or contraction of relationships with our vendors  including a reduction in the level of trade credit provided to us  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
some product manufacturers either do not permit us to sell the full line of their products or limit the number of product units available to direct marketers such as us 
an element of our business strategy is to continue to increase our participation in first to market purchase opportunities 
the availability of certain desired products  especially in the direct marketing channel  has been constrained in the past 
we could experience a material adverse effect to our business if we are unable to source first to market purchase or similar opportunities  or if we face the reemergence of significant availability constraints 
we may experience a reduction in the incentive programs offered to us by our vendors 
some product manufacturers and distributors provide us with incentives such as supplier reimbursements  payment discounts  price protection  rebates and other similar arrangements 
the increasingly competitive computer hardware market has already resulted in the following 
reduction or elimination of some of these incentive programs  
more restrictive price protection and other terms  and 
reduced advertising allowances and incentives  in some cases 
most product manufacturers provide us with co op advertising support and in exchange we cover their products in our catalogs 
this support significantly defrays our catalog production expense 
in the past  we have experienced a decrease in the level of co op advertising support available to us from certain manufacturers 
the level of co op advertising support we receive from some manufacturers may further decline in the future 
such a decline could increase our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales and have a material adverse effect on our cash flows 
we face many competitive risks 
the direct marketing industry and the computer products retail business  in particular  are highly competitive 
we compete with consumer electronics and computer retail stores  including superstores 
we also compete with other direct marketers of hardware and software and computer related products  including an increasing number of internet retailers 
certain hardware and software vendors are selling their products directly through their own catalogs and over the internet 
we compete not only for customers  but also for co op advertising support from personal computer product manufacturers 
some of our competitors have greater financial  marketing and larger catalog circulations and customer bases and other resources than we do 
in addition  many of our competitors offer a wider range of products and services than we do and may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies and customer requirements 
many current and potential competitors also have greater name recognition  engage in more extensive promotional activities and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than us 
we expect competition to increase as retailers and direct marketers who have not traditionally sold computers and related products enter the industry 
we cannot assure you that we can continue to compete effectively against our current or future competitors 
in addition  price is an important competitive factor in the personal computer hardware and software market and we cannot assure you that we will not face increased price competition 
if we encounter new competition or fail to compete effectively against our competitors  our business may be harmed 
in addition  product resellers and direct marketers are combining operations or acquiring or merging with other resellers and direct marketers to increase efficiency 
moreover  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products and services 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share 
we face and will continue to face significant price competition 
generally  pricing is very aggressive in the personal computer industry and we expect pricing pressures to continue 
an increase in price competition could result in a reduction of our profit margins 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset the effects of price reductions with an increase in the number of customers  higher sales  cost reductions or otherwise 
also  our sales of personal computer hardware products are generally producing lower profit margins than those associated with software products 
such pricing pressures could result in an erosion of our market share  reduced sales and reduced operating margins  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the methods of distributing personal computers and related products are changing and such changes may negatively impact us and our business 
the manner in which personal computers and related products are distributed and sold is changing  and new methods of distribution and sale  such as on line shopping services  have emerged 
hardware and software manufacturers have sold  and may intensify their efforts to sell  their products directly to end users 
from time to time  certain manufacturers have instituted programs for the direct sales of large order quantities of hardware and software to certain major corporate accounts 
these types of programs may continue to be developed and used by various manufacturers 
some of our vendors  including apple  compaq and ibm  currently sell some of their products directly to end users and have stated their intentions to increase the level of such direct sales 
in addition  manufacturers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically to end users 
an increase in the volume of products sold through or used by consumers of any of these competitive programs or distributed electronically to end users could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we could experience system failures which would interfere with our ability to process orders 
we depend on the accuracy and proper use of our management information systems including our telephone system 
many of our key functions depend on the quality and effective utilization of the information generated by our management information systems  including 
our ability to manage inventory and accounts receivable collection  
our ability to purchase  sell and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis  and 
our ability to maintain operations 
interruptions could result from natural disasters as well as power loss  telecommunications failure and similar events 
our management information systems require continual upgrades to most effectively manage our operations and customer database 
although we maintain some redundant systems  with full data backup  a substantial interruption in management information systems or in telephone communication systems would substantially hinder our ability to process customer orders and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we rely on the continued development of electronic commerce and internet infrastructure development 
we have had an increasing amount of sales made over the internet in part because of the growing use and acceptance of the internet by end users 
no one can be certain that acceptance and use of the internet will continue to develop or that a sufficiently broad base of consumers will adopt and continue to use the internet and other online services as a medium of commerce 
sales of computer products over the internet do not currently represent a significant portion of overall computer product sales 
growth of our internet sales is dependent on potential customers using the internet in addition to traditional means of commerce to purchase products 
we cannot accurately predict the rate at which they will do so 
our success in growing our internet business will depend in large part upon the development of an infrastructure for providing internet access and services 
if the number of internet users or their use of internet resources continues to grow rapidly  such growth may overwhelm the existing internet infrastructure 
our ability to increase the speed with which we provide services to customers and to increase the scope of such services ultimately is limited by and reliant upon the speed and reliability of the networks operated by third parties and these networks may not continue to be developed 
we depend heavily on third party shippers to deliver our products to customers 
we ship approximately of our products to customers by airborne freight corporation d b a airborne express  with the remainder being shipped by united parcel service of america  inc and other overnight delivery and surface services 
a strike or other interruption in service by these shippers could adversely affect our ability to market or deliver products to customers on a timely basis 
we may experience potential increases in shipping  paper and postage costs  which may adversely affect our business if we are not able to pass such increases on to our customers 
shipping costs are a significant expense in the operation of our business 
increases in postal or shipping rates and paper costs could significantly impact the cost of producing and mailing our catalogs and shipping customer orders 
postage prices and shipping rates increase periodically and we have no control over future increases 
we have a long term contract with airborne express whereby airborne ships products to our customers 
we believe that we have negotiated favorable shipping rates with airborne 
we generally invoice customers for shipping and handling charges 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass on to our customers the full cost  including any future increases in the cost  of commercial delivery services such as airborne 
we also incur substantial paper and postage costs related to our marketing activities  including producing and mailing our catalogs 
paper prices historically have been cyclical and we have experienced substantial increases in the past 
significant increases in postal or shipping rates and paper costs could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations  particularly if we cannot pass on such increases to our customers or offset such increases by reducing other costs 
privacy concerns with respect to list development and maintenance may materially adversely affect our business 
we mail catalogs and send electronic messages to names in our proprietary customer database and to potential customers whose names we obtain from rented or exchanged mailing lists 
world wide public concern regarding personal privacy has subjected the rental and use of customer mailing lists and other customer information to increased scrutiny 
any domestic or foreign legislation enacted limiting or prohibiting these practices could negatively affect our business 
we face many uncertainties relating to the collection of state sales or use tax 
we presently collect sales tax only on sales of products to residents of ohio  tennessee  maryland  the district of columbia  massachusetts and virginia 
we began collecting sales tax in massachusetts in january taxable sales to customers located within ohio  tennessee  maryland  the district of columbia  massachusetts and virginia were approximately of our net sales during the year ended december  various states have sought to impose on direct marketers the burden of collecting state sales taxes on the sales of products shipped to their residents 
in  the united states supreme court affirmed its position that it is unconstitutional for a state to impose sales or use tax collection obligations on an out of state mail order company whose only contacts with the state are limited to the distribution of catalogs and other advertising materials through the mail and the subsequent delivery of purchased goods by united states mail or by interstate common carrier 
however  legislation that would expand the ability of states to impose sales tax collection obligations on direct marketers has been introduced in congress on many occasions 
due to its presence on various forms of electronic media and other factors  our contact with many states may exceed the contact involved in the supreme court case 
we cannot predict the level of contact that is sufficient to permit a state to impose on us a sales tax collection obligation 
if the supreme court changes its position or if legislation is passed to overturn the supreme court s decision  the imposition of a sales or use tax collection obligation on us in states to which we ship products would result in additional administrative expenses to us  could result in price increases to our customers  and could reduce demand for our product 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our future performance will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior executives 
the competition for qualified management personnel in the computer products industry is very intense  and the loss of service of one or more of these persons could have an adverse effect on our business 
our success and plans for future growth will also depend on our ability to hire  train and retain skilled personnel in all areas of our business  including sales account managers and technical support personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract  train and retain sufficient qualified personnel to achieve our business objectives 
we are controlled by two principal stockholders 
patricia gallup and david hall  our two principal stockholders  beneficially own or control  in the aggregate  approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
because of their beneficial stock ownership  these stockholders can continue to elect the members of the board of directors and decide all matters requiring stockholder approval at a meeting or by a written consent in lieu of a meeting 
similarly  such stockholders can control decisions to adopt  amend or repeal our charter and our bylaws  or take other actions requiring the vote or consent of our stockholders and prevent a takeover of us by one or more third parties  or sell or otherwise transfer their stock to a third party  which could deprive our stockholders of a control premium that might otherwise be realized by them in connection with an acquisition of us 
such control may result in decisions that are not in the best interest of our public stockholders 
in connection with our initial public offering  the principal stockholders placed substantially all shares of common stock beneficially owned by them into a voting trust  pursuant to which they are required to agree as to the manner of voting such shares in order for the shares to be voted 
such provisions could discourage bids for our common stock at a premium as well as have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
in addition  our unsecured credit agreement provides for borrowings which bear interest at variable rates based on the prime rate 
we had no borrowings outstanding pursuant to the credit agreement as of december  we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows should not be material 
our credit agreement exposes earnings to changes in short term interest rates since interest rates on the underlying obligations are variable 
however  as noted above  there were no borrowings outstanding on the credit agreement at december  and the average outstanding borrowings during the year were not material 
accordingly  the change in earnings resulting from a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates is not material
