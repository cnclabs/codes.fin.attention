item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto 
general the company has three operating segments integrated epc engineering  procurement and construction epc services  environmental infrastructure  and manufacturing and distribution 
integrated epc services the integrated epc services segment provides a range of design and construction related services  including design  engineering  construction  procurement  maintenance  piping system fabrication  and consulting services primarily to the power generation and process industries 
environmental infrastructure the environmental infrastructure segment provides services which include the identification of contaminants in soil  air and water and the subsequent design and execution of remedial solutions 
the company also provides project and facilities management capabilities and other related services to non environmental civil construction  watershed restoration and the outsourcing privatization markets 
manufacturing and distribution the manufacturing and distribution segment manufactures and distributes specialty stainless  alloy and carbon steel pipe fittings 
these fittings include elbows  tees  reducers and stub ends 
comments regarding future operations historically  the company has used acquisitions to pursue market opportunities and to augment or increase existing capabilities  and plans to continue to do so 
however  all comments concerning the company s expectations for future revenue and operating results are based on the company s forecasts for its existing operations and do not include the potential impact of any future acquisitions 
critical accounting policies and related estimates that have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements set forth below is a discussion of the accounting policies and related estimates that the company believes are the most critical to understanding its consolidated financial statements  financial condition  and results of operations and which require complex management judgments  uncertainties and or estimates 
information regarding the company s other accounting policies is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
engineering  procurement and construction contract revenue recognition and profit and loss estimates a substantial portion of the company s revenue from both the integrated epc services and environmental infrastructure segments is derived from engineering  procurement and construction contracts 
the contracts may be performed as stand alone engineering  procurement or construction contacts or as combined contracts ie  one contract that covers engineering  procurement and construction or a combination thereof 
the company utilizes accounting principles set forth in american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts and other applicable accounting standards to account for its long term contracts 
the company recognizes revenue for these contracts on the percentage of completion method  usually based on costs incurred to date  compared with total estimated contract costs 
most of the company s contracts are cost reimbursable 
revenues from cost plus fee contracts are recognized on the basis of costs incurred during the period plus the fee earned 
profit incentives are included in revenues when their realization is reasonably assured 
provisions for estimated losses for uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are identified 
the cumulative effect of other changes to estimated contract profit and loss  including those arising from contract penalty provisions such as liquidated damages  final contract settlements  warranty claims and reviews performed by customers  are recognized in the period in which the revisions are identified 
to the extent that these adjustments result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits  the company would report such a change by recognizing a charge against current earnings  which might be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment 
an amount equal to the costs attributable to yet to be approved change orders and claims is included in the total estimated revenue when it is probable they will result in additional contract revenue and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
profit from such change orders and claims is recorded in the year such amounts are resolved 
as is common to the construction industry and inherent in the nature of the company s contracts  it is possible that there will be future and currently unknown significant adjustments to the company s currently estimated contract revenues  costs and gross margins for contracts currently in process  particularly in the latter stages of the contracts 
these future adjustments could  depending on either the magnitude of the adjustments and or the number of contracts being completed  materially positively or negatively affect the company s operating results in an annual or quarterly reporting period 
such future adjustments are  in the opinion of the company s management  most likely to occur as a result of  or be affected by  the following factors in the application of the percentage of completion accounting method discussed above for the company s contracts 
a 
revenues and gross margins from cost reimbursable  long term contracts can be significantly affected by contract incentives penalties that may not be known or recorded until the latter stages of the contracts 
substantially all of the company s revenues from cost reimbursable contracts are based on costs incurred plus the fee earned before unrealized incentives penalties 
the application of the company s revenue recognition practices for these types of contracts usually results in the company recognizing revenues ratably with a consistent gross profit margin with the occurrence of costs and construction progress during most of the contract term 
the company s cost reimbursable contracts are generally structured as either target cost or cost plus contracts 
target cost contracts contain an incentive penalty arrangement in which the company s fee is adjusted  within certain limits  for cost underruns overruns to an established target price  representing the company s estimated cost and fee for the project 
cost plus contracts reimburse the company for all of its costs  but generally limit the company s fee to a fixed percentage of costs or to a certain specified amount 
usually  target cost contracts are priced with higher fees than cost plus contracts because of the uncertainties relating to an adjustable fee arrangement 
additionally  both the target cost and cost reimbursable contracts frequently have other incentive and penalty provisions for such matters as schedule  liquidated damages and testing or performance results 
generally  the penalty provisions for the company s cost reimbursable contracts are capped to limit the company s monetary exposure to a portion of the contract gross margin 
although the company believes it is unlikely that it could incur losses or lose all of its gross margin on its cost reimbursable contracts  it is possible for penalties to reduce or eliminate previously recorded profits 
the incentive penalty provisions are usually finalized as contract change orders either subsequent to negotiation with or verification by  the company s customers 
in most situations  the amount and impact of incentives penalties are not  or cannot be  determined until the latter or completion stages of the contract  at which time the company will record the adjustment amounts on a cumulative  catch up basis 
b 
the accuracy of gross margins from fixed price contracts is dependent on the accuracy of cost estimates and other factors 
the company has a limited number of fixed price contracts  most of which were entered into on a negotiated basis 
the company also has fixed price contacts that were awarded based on competitive bids 
the accuracy of the gross margins the company reports for fixed price contracts is dependent upon various judgments it makes with respect to its contract performance  its cost estimates  and its ability to recover additional contract costs through change orders or claims 
further  many of these contracts also have incentive penalty provisions 
generally  the amount and impact of these incentives penalties are not  or cannot be  determined until the latter or completion stages of the contract 

the company recognizes adjustments to the gross margin on fixed priced contracts for changes in its cost estimates  finalization of incentives penalties  and other similar charges on a cumulative  catch up method  when such adjustments are known or probable 
the revenue recognition policies related to the company s fabrication contracts  consulting services  and pipe fittings and manufacturing operations are described in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
because of the nature of the contracts and related work  estimates and judgments usually do not play as important a role in the determination of revenue and profit and loss for these services as they do for the engineering  procurement and construction contracts 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses that could result from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company records  generally as a reduction to income  additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts based on management s assessment of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  and the balance of the allowance for doubtful accounts reduces the recognized receivable to the net amount the company believes will be ultimately collected 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  further additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts  which would reduce the company s earnings  may be required 
these increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts could be significant  given i the size of certain of the company s epc contracts and ii the fact that the company could perform a substantial amount of unreimbursed work on significant projects prior to the customer notifying the company it will not pay the amounts due

acquisitions fair value accounting and goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair market value of their identifiable net assets 
the company s goodwill balance as of august  was approximately million  most of which related to the stone webster and it group acquisitions see note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  which was issued in july sfas no 
deals with  among other matters  the accounting for goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but that impairment of goodwill assets must be reviewed on a regular basis based on a fair value concept 
sfas no 
also removed certain differences between book and tax expense  which has resulted in a reduction of the company s effective tax rate 
if sfas no 
had been in effect during fiscal and  the company estimates that its diluted earnings per share would have been increased by approximately per share and per share for the years ended august  and  respectively 
this increase in diluted earnings per share would have resulted from the cessation of goodwill amortization and a lower effective tax rate 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company has completed the initial and first annual impairment tests required with the adoption of sfas no 
and has determined that its goodwill was not impaired 
further  there is no current indication that its goodwill is or will be impaired 
however  the company s businesses are cyclical and subject to competitive pressures 
therefore  it is possible that the goodwill values of the company s businesses could be adversely impacted in the future by these or other factors and that a significant impairment adjustment  which would reduce earnings  could possibly be required in such circumstances 
additionally  the company s estimates of the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities it acquires in acquisitions are determined by reference to various internal and external data and judgments  including the use of third party experts 
these estimates can and do differ from the basis or value generally representing the acquired entity s actual or amortized cost previously recorded by the acquired entity for its assets and liabilities 
accordingly  the company s post acquisition financial statements are materially impacted by and dependent on the accuracy of management s fair value estimates and adjustments 
the company s experience has been that the most significant of these estimates are the values assigned to construction contracts  production backlog  customer relationships  licenses and technology 
these estimates can also have a positive or negative material effect on future reported operating results 
further  the company s future operating results may also be positively or negatively materially impacted if the final values for the assets acquired or liabilities assumed in its acquisitions are materially different from the fair value estimates which the company recorded for the acquisition 
earnings per share and potential equity effect of convertible debt lyons effective may   the company issued and sold million including million to cover over allotments of year  zero coupon  unsecured  convertible debt  liquid yield option tm notes lyons  debt or the securities 
the debt was issued at an original discount price of per  maturity value and has a yield to maturity of 
the company realized net proceeds after expenses from the issuance of this debt of approximately million 
the securities are a senior unsecured obligation of the company and are convertible into the company s common stock at a fixed ratio of shares per  maturity value contract conversion rate or an effective conversion price of at the date of issuance 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the above conversion feature  the holders of the debt have the right to require the company to repurchase the debt on may   may   may   and may  at the then accreted value 
the company has the right to fund such repurchases with shares of its common stock valued at the current market value  or cash  or a combination of common stock valued at the current market value and cash 
the company has  in accordance with sfas no 
earnings per share  computed its diluted earnings per share using the if converted method assumption that the lyons would be converted at the contract rate of shares per  maturity value or an approximate equivalent conversion price of at august  
under this method the company has reported diluted earnings per share to reflect approximately  additional shares on the basis that the debt would be converted into common stock at a rate of shares per  maturity value  if the effect was dilutive 
additionally  the company has presented the debt as long term debt as opposed to equity on its balance sheet 
it is the company s plan to use cash to repurchase some  or all  of the convertible debt that may be submitted for repurchase 
therefore  pursuant to sfas no 
 the company s financial statements do not reflect the effect on diluted earnings per share that could result from the issuance of additional shares of its common stock resulting from the submission by the holders of the convertible debt for repurchase on the specified anniversary dates 
the company believes  however  that depending on the magnitude of repurchase requests  it is possible that it could issue shares to satisfy a portion of any repurchase requirements 
further  it is possible that in adverse circumstances  such as a combination of a large number of repurchase requests  low stock price and or liquidity or financing restraints  the company could be required to issue a significant number of shares to satisfy its repurchase obligations and the number of shares actually issued could exceed the number of shares presently being utilized by the company to compute diluted earnings per share 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the issuance of a large number of shares could significantly dilute the value of the company s common stock and materially affect its earnings per share calculations 
results of operations the following table presents summary income and expense items as a percentage of sales for the years ended august   and for the years ended august  revenues cost of revenues gross profit general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense interest income other expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes income before earnings from unconsolidated entities earnings from unconsolidated entities income before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle extraordinary item for early extinguishment of debt  net of taxes cumulative effect on prior years of change in accounting for start up costs  net of taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal the company s revenues increased to billion from billion in fiscal the primary reasons for this increase in revenue was an approximate billion increase in revenues from construction of new gas fired power plants  realized by the integrated epc services segment 
additionally  during the third quarter of fiscal  the company acquired most of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of the it group  a leading provider of environmental and infrastructure services to governmental and commercial customers 
as a result of this acquisition  the company formed a new business segment  the environmental infrastructure segment  by combining the acquired it group operations with the company s existing environmental and infrastructure businesses 
this acquisition increased the company s revenues from environmental and infrastructure services to million from fiscal revenues of million  or an increase of million 
the following presents a comparison of the company s operating results from fiscal as compared with fiscal for the company s three business segments 
integrated epc services segment revenues by industry for the integrated epc services segment approximated the following amounts and percentages fiscal fiscal industry sector in millions in millions power generation  process industries other industries revenues increased by approximately billion from fiscal levels to billion in fiscal revenues from the domestic power generation market accounted for substantially all of this increase 
the increase in revenues was attributable to significant contracts for the construction of new gas fired power plants entered into in fiscal when there was strong demand for these facilities 
many of these contracts will be completed in fiscal process industries revenues in fiscal decreased by approximately million  from fiscal this decrease was attributable to industry trends and the company s decision not to pursue low margin projects similar to those it assumed in the stone webster acquisition 
revenues from other industries increased by approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of an increase in domestic revenues 
segment gross profit increased  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to the growth in revenue volume during the year 
gross profit in fiscal years and was increased cost of sales decreased by approximately million and million respectively  by the utilization of contract adjustments and accrued contract loss reserves that were established to record the fair value of primarily fixed price contracts acquired in the stone webster acquisition 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the gross profit margin percentage for the year ended august  decreased to from in the prior year 
this decrease in gross margin percentage is attributable to fiscal revenues having a much higher percentage of lower margin revenue as compared with fiscal the lower margins relate primarily to i cost reimbursable contracts entered into in fiscal and ii purchases of large equipment items for power generation contracts 
prior to fiscal  revenues included a higher percentage of fixed price contracts which were generally priced with higher gross margins than cost reimbursable contracts in order to compensate for cost overrun risks 
also during fiscal  revenues from large equipment purchases on behalf of customers were approximately million as compared with approximately million in fiscal and these revenues generally carry a very low gross margin due to the pass through nature of their underlying costs 
a substantial portion of the integrated epc services segment s revenues in fiscal will also be derived from cost reimbursable contracts and there will also be revenues from contracts requiring large equipment purchases although anticipated to be less than in fiscal 
accordingly  the company expects that gross profit margin percentages on work performed in fiscal will be comparable with fiscal margins 
however  further weakening of demand in the power generation market or in the financial condition of certain of the company s customers in the industry could result in lower margins than those experienced in fiscal segment backlog at august  was approximately billion as compared with approximately billion at august   and was comprised of the following at august  in millions in millions industry sector power generation nuclear power  fossil fuel epc  other total power generation   process industries other industries total integrated epc services   the company s backlog from the power industry decreased by approximately million during fiscal this decline was primarily because the demand for the construction of new domestic power plants fell dramatically due to questions about future economic growth rates and whether the united states had excess power generation capacity 
further  certain of the company s independent and merchant power producer customers experienced severe liquidity problems as financing was reduced to these companies and their projects 
as a result of these conditions  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  three customers cancelled or suspended their projects  resulting in a reduction of the company s backlog by approximately million 
the company was paid current sums due on two of the projects pursuant to their contractual terms and has continued to provide services to close down one of those two projects 
however  the company has not been paid on the third project and is attempting to collect the amounts due through a combination of negotiations and or legal actions 
the company is also concerned that another customer may not be able to provide funding to complete two other projects that are presently included in the company s backlog at a value of approximately million as of august  see contingencies associated with domestic power market epc projects below for a complete discussion of the impact of these changes 
the company anticipates that in the future  the integrated epc services segment will continue to derive significant revenues from the power industry including both fossil fuel and nuclear 
the company recognized revenue of approximately billion and million in fiscal and  respectively  from contracts for the construction of new gas fired power plants 
however  because of the problems experienced by independent and merchant power producers  it will not derive as much revenue from the construction of new gas fired power plants as it did in fiscal years as indicated by the approximate billion decrease in backlog for epc fossil fuel contracts in fiscal 
although award levels will be less than in prior years  the company anticipates it will continue to design and construct new power plants primarily for regulated utilities or for cogeneration 
additionally  the company expects to increase its revenues from other sectors of the domestic power industry through  for example  contracts to re power  refurbish or maintain existing power plants  and to provide and install emission control equipment 
the company has also recently seen increases in bid and proposal activity in various foreign process and power industry sectors 
contingencies associated with domestic power market epc projects in fiscal and  the company entered into several significant epc contracts for new domestic gas fired combined cycle power plants 
as discussed above  during fiscal and  the company recognized revenues of approximately billion and million  respectively  related to these contracts 
the company s customers for these power plants are major utility companies and ipps  several of which where wholly or partially owned subsidiaries of major utilities 
in fiscal  demand for new capacity in the domestic power market significantly decreased  resulting in  among other things  financial distress among many participants in the domestic power markets  particularly the ipps 
although at the time the company entered into these contracts  all of these customers had investment grade credit ratings  during  all of the company s ipp customers received downgrades to their credit ratings  which are now considered to be below investment grade 
the condition of the national power market  these downgrades and other factors resulted in three projects being canceled or suspended 
for one of these projects  pike  discussed further below  the company was notified by the customer of their intention to not make a scheduled milestone payment on its required due date 
as of august   the company has million remaining in backlog related to gas fired combined cycle power plant projects  million for ipps on six projects with the remaining million for major utility companies on three projects 
the company believes that the continuation of certain of the projects for the ipps is dependent upon the customer and or the customer s parent company successfully obtaining additional or alternative financing sources  such as receiving extension of their credit facilities  restructuring of their financial obligations or agreements with funding sources to continue to fund the projects to completion 
the company believes the three projects for the major utility companies will be completed 
under all agreements the company has the right to stop construction if the milestone billings are not made by the counterparty 
in addition  under the terms of one contract with an ipp  the customer  at its option  can pay a portion of the contract price in subordinated notes or cash 
the company believes that the amount payable in subordinated notes will not exceed million under the terms of the contract 
if elected by the customer  the subordinated notes would bear interest at prime plus and mature in october however  if any amounts under the notes are unpaid eight months following final acceptance of the project  the unpaid notes  plus a cash payment of the amounts  if any  paid on the notes through the conversion date  is convertible at the option of the company into a equity interest in the related project 
the payments that could be made with these notes would be due in the first half of fiscal and final acceptance of the project is expected in the first half of calendar the pike project during the fourth quarter of  one of the company s customers  lsp pike energy  llc pike notified the company of its intention to not pay a scheduled milestone billing on the required due date of august  pike is a subsidiary of nrg energy  inc nrg  which is wholly owned by xcel energy inc xcel 
in accordance with the terms of the contract  on september   the company notified the customer it was in breach of the terms of the contract for nonpayment and  therefore  the contract was terminated 
no amounts are included in backlog at august  related to the pike project 
prior to the contract termination  the company had executed commitments agreements to purchase equipment for the project and had also entered into agreements with subcontractors to perform work on the project 
certain of these commitments and agreements contain cancellation clauses and related payment or settlement provisions 
the company has entered into discussions with its vendors and subcontractors to determine the final amounts owed based on the termination of the company s contract 
the company believes pursuant to the terms of the contract with pike that the company has retained ownership of a significant amount of this equipment and other pieces of equipment that were to be installed on the project 
under the terms of the original contract between the company and pike  pike is obligated to reimburse the company for all of the costs incurred by the company whether before or after the termination and a fee for the work performed prior to the termination 
the company believes that it is owed approximately million in costs to be incurred and fees over the amounts already paid under the contract 
the company is actively pursuing alternatives to collect all amounts it is owed under the pike contract 
on october   the company filed an involuntary petition for liquidation of pike  under chapter of the us bankruptcy code to protect its rights  claims  and security interests in and to the assets of pike 
the company also filed suit against nrg and xcel  along with certain of their officers to collect amounts due  damages  and costs 
in addition to the legal proceedings  the company will continue to pursue discussions with pike  nrg  xcel and their lenders in an effort to resolve collection of the amounts owed 
the company believes it will ultimately recover the costs it incurred and will incur under the terms of the contract and the profit it has recognized through august  on the project 
the company will not recognize any additional profit it is owed under this contract until it is probable it will collect that additional amount 
although the company expects to recover amounts owed to it including final vendor and subcontractor settlements  it is also reasonably possible that the company will not recover all of its costs and profit recognized through august   on the project  particularly if the customer s financial situation continues to deteriorate and if the equipment in the possession of the company cannot be used on another similar project or liquidated by the company to recover all or a portion of the amount owed 
the amount  if any  that may not be recoverable is dependent upon the final amounts to be expended by the company related to the project  the amount to be realized upon disposition of the equipment related to the project and the financial wherewithal of the customer in the future  which is dependent upon its ability to restructure and or reach agreement with its creditors or to obtain additional funding from its parent company 
the company has  in connection with its evaluation of the pike project  estimated that i it has or will incur costs of approximately million to million over the amounts that have been previously collected from pike and ii equipment that was to be installed on the project could be liquidated for approximately million to million 
although the company does not believe a loss has been incurred as of august   based on these estimates  if the company is unable to collect additional amounts from its customer or its affiliates or lenders  the company s future potential loss on the pike project could range from million to million 
any potential loss on the project will be recognized charged to earnings in the period when it is determined that a loss is likely to occur and a loss amount can be reasonably estimated 
the covert harquahala projects on october   the parent company  pg e corp 
pg e  of a customer  pg e national energy group  inc neg  announced that it had notified its lenders that it did not intend to make further equity contributions as required under the credit facility to fund two projects  covert and harquahala  currently in progress on which the company is the contractor 
at august   the company has included in backlog estimated revenue of approximately million from these projects 
as of november   the company continues working on the projects under the contract terms  however  the company cannot guarantee that these projects will be completed 
the continuation of the projects is dependent upon whether i the lenders will elect to continue to fund the project without additional equity contributions from the customer  ii the lenders will exercise their right to take ownership of the projects or iii the contracts will be suspended or cancelled by the customer or the lenders 
if the lenders exercise their rights to take ownership of the projects and complete them  the epc portion of the contracts would be a fixed price contract with the lenders 
although the target price components of the original contracts would still be enforceable against neg  the company may not be able to seek collection from the lenders for these components of the original contracts 
based on the company s current estimate of costs to complete the project  there would be no material impact of this change 
however  given the uncertainty of collecting additional amounts from neg  if the actual costs to complete the projects exceed the estimated costs at this time  the company would be assuming higher risk under this fixed price contract and could be susceptible to losses on these projects 
if the contracts were ultimately terminated  the company would be obligated under related commitments to complete the payment for various pieces of equipment procured for the projects and obligations to subcontractors for work performed on the projects 
under the terms of the contracts  if the contracts are terminated or suspended  the customer would be obligated to reimburse the company for the costs incurred by the company and a fee for the work performed 
although no assurances can be made  the company believes that it would be able to recover any amounts owed to it under the contracts through collection from the customer  its parent  and or the lenders 
in addition  the company believes that it has first lien rights  superior to the primary lenders  on the partially completed projects 
the projects are each over complete at an estimated total cost at completion of over million each 
although the company believes its lien rights will ultimately provide sufficient security to ensure full payment for any amounts due if the customer is unable to pay  the company estimates that it has exposure  which includes costs incurred and committed over amounts collected and profit recorded on the two projects  of approximately million to million as of november  this amount will fluctuate as construction progresses 
the company estimates that its maximum exposure in the future  which is dependent upon the timing of additional costs incurred on the projects and timing of the receipt of milestone billings  is approximately million to million 
on october  the company received approximately million from the lenders on these projects in payments for invoices due at that date 
as of november  the company has been paid for all amounts currently due 
although no assurances can be made  the company believes that it will recover all amounts owed to it under these contracts through collection from the customer or its lenders 
it is reasonably possible however  that the company may not collect all future amounts owed to it under this project which could have an adverse effect on operating results in the period when the uncollectable amounts would be recognized 
environmental infrastructure segment environmental infrastructure segment revenues in fiscal were million  an increase of million from fiscal totals of million 
this increase was entirely attributable to the company s acquisition of the it group assets see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
gross margin in fiscal was million as compared with million in fiscal gross profit in fiscal year was increased cost of revenues decreased by approximately million for the amortization of asset liability adjustments to the fair value of contracts acquired in the it group acquisition 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
the gross margin percentage in fiscal was approximately and approximately in fiscal the reduction in the gross margin percentage in fiscal as compared with fiscal was attributable to lower margin contracts that were acquired in the it group transaction 
the company anticipates that the gross margin percentage for the environmental infrastructure segment will also decrease in fiscal due to the inclusion of a full year s operating results from assets acquired from the it group 
the difference in the gross margin percentages between the company s pre it group environmental and infrastructure operations primarily infrastructure and hazardous material clean up and disposal and those acquired in the it group asset acquisition environmental clean up  landfills and facilities management is primarily attributable to such factors as different customers  competition and mix of services 
backlog in this segment at august  was approximately billion compared with approximately billion at august  this increase was entirely attributable to the it group acquisition 
the company believes the environmental infrastructure segment revenues will increase over the next several years  as a result of a combination of factors  such as  market opportunities in various environmental clean up  homeland defense and infrastructure markets and the company s belief that it will be able to re gain market share which the it group lost while it was experiencing financial difficulties  including the period in which it was in bankruptcy during the first four months of calendar manufacturing and distribution segment revenues decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal however  segment net income increased in fiscal to approximately million from approximately million in fiscal this increase was attributable to better gross profit margins achieved as a result of sales of products with a higher gross margin than in fiscal manufacturing and distribution backlog was approximately million at august  the majority of revenue generated from manufacturing and distribution does not come from backlog orders 
general and administrative expenses  interest expense and income  income taxes and other comprehensive income general and administrative expenses excluding goodwill amortization  increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from expenses associated with i the increase in the company s revenue and ii the it group acquisition 
however  as a result of the company s efforts to control its expenses and economies realized from the integration of stone webster  general and administrative expenses excluding goodwill amortization in fiscal decreased as a percentage of sales to from in fiscal the company expects the total of general and administrative expenses to increase slightly in fiscal  as compared with fiscal the increase in general and administrative costs will primarily result from i the company recognizing a full year of expenses including depreciation and amortization associated with new facilities  equipment and software which were placed into service in the latter part of fiscal and ii the it group acquisition 
however  the company also expects to offset these increases with cost reductions attained from the integration of the it group businesses and cost reductions commensurate with reductions in revenue from the power generation market 
the company s interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of having convertible debt outstanding for the full fiscal year 
interest income also increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to the company s investment of a substantial portion of the funds received from the sale of its convertible debt 
however  the interest rates the company received on these investments decreased substantially from rates it received in fiscal due to the general decline in interest rates between periods 
the company s effective tax rates for the years ended august  and were and  respectively 
the company s estimates of its tax rates are derived from company estimates of pretax income for each year and the mix of domestic and foreign sourced including foreign export sales income 
the decrease in the tax rates in fiscal versus fiscal is due primarily to the company s adoption of sfas no 
in fiscal see note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the company s adoption of sfas no 
it no longer recognizes goodwill amortization expense in its financial statements 
accordingly  the company s effective tax rate decreased in fiscal because it no longer recognizes goodwill amortization expense which is only partially deductible for tax purposes in its financial statements 
this decrease was partially offset by increased domestic income in fiscal that has a higher tax rate than most foreign income 
the company did not pay any federal income taxes in fiscal and primarily because of its utilization of operating losses resulting from the stone webster acquisition 
the company anticipates that it will pay federal income taxes in  however  the amount to be paid is subject to a number of factors 
the company established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax asset for australian net operating losses 
the valuation allowance reflects the company s judgment that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company believes that the remaining deferred tax assets at august   amounting to million  are realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income 
uncertainties that affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets include the risk of not having future taxable income 
this factor has been considered in determining the valuation allowance 
additionally  at august   the company had recorded a  liability for a uk defined benefit retirement plan 
also see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
this liability is required to be recognized on the plan sponsor s balance sheet when the accumulated benefit obligations of the plan exceed the fair value of the plan s assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions the increase in the minimum liability is recorded through a direct charge to stockholders equity and is  therefore  reflected  net of tax  as a component of comprehensive income in the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
this liability will require the company to increase its future contributions to the plan 
fiscal compared to fiscal the company s revenues increased to billion in fiscal from million in fiscal revenues from all of the company s business segments increased in fiscal year  when compared to fiscal  with the integrated epc services segment increasing by million or over the prior fiscal year 
this revenue increase was attributable to revenue from stone webster businesses  which were acquired in july see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues from the environmental infrastructure segment increased to million for fiscal  an increase of million from fiscal levels of million 
all revenues for the environmental infrastructure segment were from operations acquired in the stone webster acquisition 
revenues from the manufacturing and distribution segment increased million  or  from fiscal levels to million for fiscal gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to increased revenues 
revenues from domestic projects increased million  or  from million for fiscal to billion for fiscal the power generation market was robust in the us  accounting for approximately million of the increase in domestic revenues for fiscal these increases were made possible primarily by the stone webster acquisition 
further  as a result of the acquisition of stone webster  the company commenced to conduct business in the environmental and infrastructure industry sector 
domestic revenues from this industry sector increased by million for the year ended august  the increases in the domestic power generation and environmental and infrastructure domestic sectors were partially offset by decreases in domestic process work 
domestic process industries sector revenues decreased million primarily due to decreases of revenues from the refining industry revenues from international projects increased million  or  to million from fiscal to fiscal revenues from the asia pacific rim region and europe increased from prior year s levels primarily due to work performed by the acquired stone webster businesses 
additionally  in fiscal  the company finalized an agreement for the construction of a  metric tons per year ethylene plant in china  which will significantly impact this area through fiscal revenues from south america and the middle east regions remained sluggish 
the company s revenues in the following industries approximated the following amounts and percentages fiscal fiscal industry sector in millions in millions power generation process industries environmental infrastructure other industries revenues from both domestic and international power generation projects increased by a total of million in fiscal from fiscal demand in the united states for power generation projects remained high  and was responsible for of the power generation revenue increase 
the acquisition of stone webster has enabled the company to capitalize on the increase in demand to construct power generation plants 
the decrease in process industries revenues in fiscal from fiscal resulted primarily from reductions in domestic refining work 
additionally  the stone webster acquisition resulted in the addition of the environmental and infrastructure industry sector to the company s capabilities 
gross profit increased  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to the growth in revenue volume during the year 
the company s gross profit in fiscal was increased cost of revenues decreased by approximately million by the utilization of reserves which were established to record the fair value of primarily fixed price contracts acquired in the stone webster acquisition see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  the company increased the contract liability adjustment and the accrued contract loss reserve for contracts acquired from stone webster by million and million  respectively 
these increases were made to finalize the company s purchase accounting fair value assessment of the related acquired contracts in progress and primarily reflected a customer s decision to recommence a large foreign nuclear project which had been suspended and to adjust the reserves of certain other contracts based on a current evaluation of their status as of the acquisition date 
these adjustments increased goodwill recorded for the acquisition 
the gross profit margin percentage for the year ended august  decreased to from from fiscal the company is involved in numerous projects  and  as a result  the company s consolidated gross profit margin can be affected by many factors 
these include matters  such as product mix eg  engineering and consulting versus construction and procurement  pricing strategies  foreign versus domestic work profit margins differ  sometimes substantially  depending on the location of the work and adjustments to project profit estimates during the project term 
during fiscal  stone webster s operating results were included in the company s consolidated financial statements for the entire year as compared to only one and one half months in fiscal epc contracts  such as those that stone webster worked on during fiscal  typically have lower gross profit margin percentages than the company s historical gross profit margin percentages 
these contracts were a contributing factor to the lower gross profit margin percentage in fiscal as compared with fiscal additionally  during fiscal  as compared with prior periods  the company entered into more cost reimbursable contracts as opposed to fixed price projects 
cost reimbursable contracts generally allow the company to recover any cost overruns 
accordingly  cost reimbursable contracts are frequently priced with lower gross margins than fixed price contracts  because fixed priced contracts are usually bid with higher margins to compensate for cost overrun risks 
in fiscal  general and administrative expenses  which include goodwill amortization  increased to million from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from i expenses associated with the stone webster businesses and ii an approximate million increase in goodwill amortization  also resulting primarily from the stone webster acquisition 
however  as a result of economies realized with the integration of stone webster into shaw  general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased as a percentage of revenues to from compared with fiscal in may  the company realized approximately million net proceeds after offering expenses from the issuance and sale of million of year  zero coupon  unsecured  convertible debt liquid yield option notes the lyons due the lyons were issued on an original discount basis of per lyon  providing the holders with a yield to maturity of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company used these proceeds to retire the majority of its outstanding borrowings and to invest surplus funds in investments with yields higher than the interest on the debt 
interest expense for the year increased to million from million in fiscal year this increase was largely attributable to higher borrowing levels and higher interest rates on the company s primary revolving line of credit facility during fiscal prior to the sale of the lyons in may interest expense was favorably impacted in fiscal and by excluding approximately million and million  respectively  of interest expense attributable to the operations of a cold storage operation reported as an asset held for sale 
the company s interest expense for fiscal  and for future periods  includes the amortization of loan origination costs for both its revolving credit facility and its lyons debt  and therefore  its reported interest expense is and will be higher than expected  based on borrowing levels 
interest income was million for fiscal compared with 
million for fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to interest income realized from investments in high quality  short term debt instruments 
the funds for these investments were primarily provided from the net proceeds after retiring other outstanding debt from the sale of the company s convertible debt instruments in may see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  the yields from these investments were greater than the interest costs associated with the convertible debt 
the company s effective tax rates for the years ended august  and were and  respectively 
the company s tax rates for each period during each year represent the company s estimate of its effective tax rates for each entire year based primarily on the company s estimate of pretax income for the year and the mix of domestic and foreign sourced income including foreign export revenue 
the increase in the tax rates in fiscal versus fiscal is due primarily to the increase in domestic revenues and an increase in nondeductible expenses  such as a portion of the goodwill recognized from the stone webster acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations was approximately million for fiscal compared with million of net cash provided by operations in fiscal in fiscal  cash was increased by i net income of million  ii deferred tax expense of million  iii depreciation and amortization of million  and iv interest accretion and loan fee amortization of million 
additionally  net cash was increased by changes in certain assets and liabilities of million  comprised primarily of increases in advanced billings and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts  accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a decrease in receivables 
these sources of cash were partially offset by an increase in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  as well as other changes in certain assets and liabilities 
the net cash realized from the changes in the assets and liabilities were substantially attributable to the timing of collection of project revenues and billings and the payment of project costs and general and administrative expenses 
additionally  the company received cash from payments on accounts receivables acquired from the it group 
during fiscal  the company billed and collected substantial advanced billings on its larger epc contracts  which positively impacted cash flow in fiscal during fiscal  the company s cash flow will be negatively impacted as the company utilizes these funds to pay project costs 
therefore  even though the company expects positive cash flow from operations in fiscal  the company does not expect to sustain the levels of cash flows received in fiscal year additionally  the company acquired a large number of contracts in the stone webster and it group acquisitions with lower than market rate margins due to the effect of the financial difficulties experienced by stone webster and the it group on negotiating and executing contracts prior to acquisition 
these contracts were adjusted to their fair value as an asset or liability and the related amortization has the net effect of reducing cost of revenues for the contracts as they are completed 
cost of revenues was reduced on a net basis by approximately million and million during fiscal and  respectively  through the amortization of these adjustments  which is a non cash component of income 
the amortization of these assets and liabilities resulted in a corresponding net increase in gross profit during fiscal and the adjustments are amortized over the lives of the contracts  which for certain it group contracts  will continue for five to ten years 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million in fiscal  compared with net cash provided of million for the prior fiscal year 
the company used cash of approximately million to fund the it group acquisition and million to fund the pyscor acquisition 
during fiscal  the company purchased million of property and equipment that included additions to the company s facilities and equipment and upgrades of corporate information systems and software programs 
the company anticipates that property and equipment purchases for fiscal will be much less than in fiscal due to the completion in fiscal of most of the planned system and facilities upgrades 
purchases of marketable securities exceeded the maturities of marketable securities by approximately million 
additionally  the company acquired an option  at a cost of approximately million  to acquire additional office building space in the baton rouge area 
this option was purchased to assure that the company will have adequate office facilities to support future growth of its operations in the baton rouge area 
the company invested approximately million in a new joint venture in china that was formed in fiscal the company also received cash distributions and advance repayments of approximately million from its unconsolidated subsidiaries million from entergyshaw  and it also received proceeds of approximately million from the sale of assets 
net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately million in fiscal  compared with million of net cash provided in fiscal during fiscal  the company purchased approximately million of treasury stock  shares in accordance with a plan authorized by the company s board of directors see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
additionally  the company made payments on debt and leases of approximately million and on its foreign revolving credit lines of approximately million 
the company also received approximately million from employees upon the exercise of stock options during fiscal in fiscal  the company received approximately million from the issuance of lyons convertible debt  as well as other normal course of business borrowings of approximately million  accounting for the positive cash provided by financing activities in fiscal as of august  the company had the following contractual obligations payments due by period in millions less than contractual obligations total year years years after years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations also see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company s contingencies 
at august   the company had both letter of credit commitments and bonding obligations  that generally were issued to secure performance and financial obligations on certain of its construction contracts  which expire as follows amounts of commitment expiration by period in millions less than other commercial commitments total year years years after years letters of credit surety bonds total commercial commitments note other commercial commitment totals exclude any letters of credit or surety bonding obligations associated with outstanding bids or proposals or other work which were not awarded prior to august  the surety bond commitments include escrowed cash 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements the company s primary credit facility credit facility  dated july  is for a three year term  and provides that both revolving credit loans and letters of credit may be issued within the limits of this facility 
the credit facility was amended on february  to  among other matters  increase the total credit facility to million from million and to eliminate the previous million limit on letters of credit 
the company also has the option to further increase the credit facility under existing terms to million  if certain conditions are satisfied  including the successful solicitation of additional lenders or increased participation of existing lenders 
the amended credit facility allows the company to borrow either at interest rates i in a range of to over the london interbank offered rate libor or ii from the prime rate to over the prime rate 
the company selects the interest rate index and the spread over the index is dependent upon certain financial ratios of the company 
the credit facility is secured by  among other things  i guarantees by the company s domestic subsidiaries  ii a pledge of all of the capital stock in the company s domestic subsidiaries and of the capital stock in certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries  and iii a security interest in all property of the company and its domestic subsidiaries except real estate and equipment 
the credit facility also contains restrictive covenants and other restrictions  which include but are not limited to the maintenance of specified ratios and minimum capital levels and limits on other borrowings  capital expenditures and investments 
additionally  the credit facility established a  aggregate limit on the amount of the company s common stock repurchases and or lyons repurchases made subsequent to february   without prior consent 
subsequent consent was provided to allow the company to complete in october the million common stock repurchase program which was authorized by the company s board of directors in september see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of august   the company was in compliance with these covenants or had obtained the necessary waivers 
at august  and  letters of credit of approximately million and million  respectively  were outstanding and no revolving credit loans were outstanding under the credit facility 
the company s total availability under the credit facility at august  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
at august   the interest rate on this line of credit was either if the prime rate index had been chosen or if the libor rate index had been chosen 
at august   the interest rate on this line of credit was either if the prime rate index had been chosen or if the libor rate index had been chosen 
as of august  and  the company s foreign subsidiaries had short term revolving lines of credit permitting borrowings totaling approximately million and million  respectively 
these subsidiaries had outstanding borrowings under these lines of approximately million and million  respectively  at a weighted average interest rate of approximately and  respectively  at august  and although the company had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of august   the credit facility is still available to the company and was being used to provide letters of credit to satisfy various project guarantee requirements 
the credit facility expires in july the company anticipates that it will revise and extend the credit facility in the second quarter of fiscal to provide for a new three year term from the date of the revision 
the company has previously used this credit facility to provide working capital and to fund fixed asset purchases and subsidiary acquisitions  including the acquisition of substantially all of the operating assets of stone webster 
at august   the company had working capital of approximately million and unutilized borrowing capacity under its major credit facility of approximately million 
the company anticipates having positive cash flow from operations over the next twelve months 
during the first quarter of fiscal the company purchased approximately  shares of its common stock for a cost of approximately million 
these purchases completed the company s million common stock repurchase program that it initiated in september the company s working capital requirements for fiscal will be impacted by such factors as i the amount of increased working capital necessary to support the operations and the settlement of assumed liabilities of the recently acquired it group  ii the timing and negotiated payment terms of its projects and iii its capital expenditures program 
further  the company anticipates recording in the third quarter of fiscal an increase in the current maturity of long term debt as a reduction to working capital related to the company s lyons obligations 
this adjustment will not affect actual liquidity requirements in fiscal however  an adjustment to classify at least part of the debt as having a current maturity will be required because the owners of the lyons notes are permitted  if they chose to do so  to submit these notes to the company in may for repurchase by the company 
the company may choose to repurchase the lyons in either cash or shares of the company s common stock  or a combination of common stock and cash 
accordingly  as a result of these factors  the company s working capital position is expected to decrease during the next twelve months 
the company believes that its million of working capital and unused borrowing capacity of million at august   is in excess of its identified short term working capital needs  based on its existing operations and that it will have sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity to fund its operations for the next twelve months 
effects of inflation the company will continue to focus its operations on cost reimbursable or negotiated fixed price contracts 
to the extent that a significant portion of the company s revenues are earned under cost reimbursable type contracts  the effects of inflation on the company s financial condition and results of operations should generally be low 
however  if the company expands its business into markets and geographical areas where fixed price work is more prevalent  inflation may begin to have a larger impact on the company s results of operations 
to the extent permitted by competition  the company intends to continue to emphasize contracts that are either cost reimbursable or negotiated fixed price 
for contracts the company accepts with fixed price terms  the company monitors closely the actual costs on the project as they compare to the budget estimates 
on these projects  the company also attempts to secure fixed price commitments from key subcontractors and vendors 
however  due to the competitive nature of the company s industry  combined with the fluctuating demands and prices associated with personnel  equipment and materials the company traditionally needs in order to perform on its contracts  there can be no guarantee that inflation will not effect the company s results of operations in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement  which is first effective for the company beginning in fiscal  requires that the cost of legal obligations associated with the retirement and or removal of long lived assets should be accounted for as additional asset costs and that the net present value of the retirement removal costs be recorded as a liability 
asset values to include retirement and removal costs are subject to impairment reviews pursuant to sfas no 
see below 
the company believes this statement will not have a material effect on its financial statements in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the new statement also supersedes certain aspects of apb reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  with regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business and will require expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be reported in discontinued operations in the period incurred rather than as of the measurement date as presently required by apb additionally  this statement increases the likelihood that dispositions will now qualify for discontinued operations treatment 
the provisions of the statement are required to be applied for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company does not expect this statement will have a material effect on its financial statements when it adopts this standard in fiscal in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
rescission of fasb statements nos 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections which is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  this statement  among other matters  provides guidance with respect to the accounting for gain or loss on capital leases that were modified to become operating leases 
the statement also eliminates the requirement that gains or losses on the early extinguishment of debt be classified as extraordinary items and provides guidance when the gain or loss on the early retirement of debt should or should not be reflected as an extraordinary item 
the company will be required to reclassify the extraordinary losses recognized in prior years as ordinary loss upon adoption of this standard when it becomes effective in fiscal in july the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement requires that costs associated with terminating employees or contracts or closing or relocating facilities are to be recognized at fair value at the time the liability is incurred 
the company does not anticipate that this statement will have a material effect on its financial statements when it becomes effective for disposal activities initiated after december  risk factors investing in the company s common stock will provide an investor with an equity ownership interest in the company 
shareholders will be subject to risks inherent in the company s business 
the performance of shaw s shares will reflect the performance of the company s business relative to  among other things  general economic and industry conditions  market conditions and competition 
the value of the investment in the company may increase or decrease and could result in a loss 
an investor should carefully consider the following factors as well as other information contained in this form k  to include the discussion of the company s critical accounting polices  before deciding to invest in shares of the company s common stock 
this form k also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including the risk factors described below and the other factors described elsewhere in this form k 
demand for the company s products and services is cyclical and vulnerable to downturns in the industries to which the company markets its products and services 
the demand for shaw s products and services depends on the existence of engineering  construction and maintenance projects  particularly in the power generation and environmental and infrastructure industries that together accounted for approximately of the company s backlog as of august  the company also depends  to a lesser extent  on conditions in the petrochemical  chemical  and refining industries 
these industries historically have been  and will likely continue to be  cyclical in nature and vulnerable to general downturns in the domestic and international economies 
the company s results of operations have varied and may continue to vary depending on the demand for future projects from these industries 
in fiscal  there has been a slowdown in construction activity and new construction awards for power generation projects  primarily as a result of less activity by certain independent power producers who have encountered financing and liquidity problems 
additionally  the planning for new projects by the power generation industry has been affected by recent economic forecasts which indicate the possibility that growth rates in the united states may be less than previously anticipated 
the company can provide no assurance as to future demand for new power generation projects or its other projects and services 
the dollar amount of the company s backlog  as stated at any given time  is not necessarily indicative of its future earnings 
as of august   the company s backlog was approximately billion 
shaw can provide no assurances that the revenues projected in its backlog will be realized or  if realized  will result in profits 
further  project terminations  suspensions or adjustments in scope may occur with respect to contracts reflected by the company in its backlog 
for example  during the company s fourth quarter of fiscal  three domestic power projects previously reflected in the company s backlog were suspended or cancelled  resulting in a reduction of in excess of million to backlog 
reductions in backlog of this type or otherwise adversely affect  potentially to a material extent  the revenue and profit the company actually receives from contracts projected in backlog 
in the event of project cancellation  shaw may be reimbursed for certain costs but typically has no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in the company s backlog 
in addition  projects may remain in the company s backlog for extended periods of time 
if shaw were to experience significant cancellations or delays of projects in its backlog  the company s financial condition would be significantly adversely affected 
the company defines its backlog as a working backlog which includes projects for which shaw has received a commitment from its customers 
this commitment may be in the form of a written contract for a specific project  a purchase order or an indication of the amount of time or material shaw needs to make available for a customer s anticipated project 
in certain instances  the engagement is for a particular product or project for which shaw estimates anticipated revenue  often based on engineering and design specifications that have not been finalized and may be revised over time 
also  the company estimates based on the company s prior experience the amount of future work it will receive for multi year government contracts for which funding is approved on an annual or periodic basis during the term of the contract 
in the environmental infrastructure segment  many of these contracts are multi year indefinite delivery order ido agreements with the federal government 
these contracts do not initially provide for a specific amount of work and the contract backlog ido agreements is derived from the company s historical experience with ido contracts 
the company s backlog for maintenance work is derived from maintenance contracts and customers historic maintenance requirements 
accordingly  the amount of future actual awards may be more or less than the company s estimates 
the company also includes in backlog commitments from certain individual customers who have committed to more than one significant epc project and other customers who have committed to multi year orders for environmental  piping or maintenance services 
the company cannot be assured that the customers will complete all of these projects or that the projects will be performed in the currently anticipated time frame 
difficulties integrating the acquisition of the assets of it group and other acquisitions could adversely affect shaw 
the it group acquisition represents a significant acquisition for shaw and it has enabled the company to expand its traditional lines of business 
the it group acquisition also brings shaw into businesses it has not previously conducted and exposes shaw to additional business risks that are different than those it has traditionally experienced 
in addition  the company has and may continue to acquire new businesses 
as a result  the company may encounter difficulties integrating the it group acquisition and the company s other acquisitions and successfully managing the growth the company expects to experience from the acquisitions 
to the extent the company encounters problems in integrating the it group acquisition and any other acquisitions  the company could be materially adversely affected 
the company plans to pursue select acquisitions in the future 
because the company may pursue acquisitions around the world and may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously  the company may encounter unforeseen expenses  complications and delays  including difficulties in employing sufficient staff and operational and management oversight 
the company may incur unexpected liabilities associated with the stone webster and it group acquisitions  as well as other acquisitions 
the company believes  pursuant to the terms of the agreements for the stone webster and it group asset acquisitions  that it assumed only certain liabilities assumed liabilities specified in the agreements related to such acquisitions 
in addition  the agreements related to such acquisitions provide that certain other liabilities  including but not limited to  certain outstanding borrowings  certain leases  certain contracts in process  completed contracts  claims or litigation that relate to acts or event occurring prior to the actual acquisition date  and certain employee benefit obligations are specifically excluded excluded liabilities from the company s transactions 
the company  however  cannot provide any assurances that it does not have any exposure related to the excluded liabilities 
in addition  some of the former owners of companies shaw has acquired are contractually required to indemnify the company against liabilities related to the operation of their companies before shaw acquired them and for misrepresentations made by them in connection with the acquisitions 
in some cases  these former owners may not have the financial ability to meet their indemnification responsibilities 
if this occurs  the company may incur unexpected liabilities 
the nature of shaw s contracts could adversely affect the company 
shaw enters into fixed price or unit price contracts on a significant number of domestic piping contracts and substantially all international piping projects 
in addition  a number of the contracts the company assumed in the stone webster and it group acquisitions were fixed price contracts and the company may continue to enter into these types of contracts in the future 
under fixed  maximum or unit price contracts  the company agrees to perform the contract for a fixed price  and as a result  benefits from costs savings  but is unable to recover any cost overruns 
under fixed price incentive contracts  the company shares with the customer any savings up to a negotiated or target ceiling 
when costs exceed the negotiated ceiling price  the company may be required to reduce its fee or to absorb some or all of the cost overruns 
contract prices are established based in part on cost estimates that are subject to a number of assumptions  including assumptions regarding future economic conditions 
if these estimates prove inaccurate or circumstances change  cost overruns having a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of its operations could occur 
shaw s profit for these projects could decrease or the company could experience losses  if the company is unable to secure fixed pricing commitments from its suppliers at the time the contracts are entered into or if the company experiences cost increases for material or labor during the performance of the contracts 
the company enters into contractual agreements with customers for some of its engineering  procurement and construction services to be performed based on agreed upon reimbursable costs and labor rates 
some of these contracts provide for the customer s review of the accounting and cost control systems to verify the completeness and accuracy of the reimbursable costs invoiced 
these reviews could result in proposed reductions in reimbursable costs and labor rates previously billed to the customer 
the company is subject to the risks associated with being a government contractor  particularly due to the acquisitions of the assets of it group 
as a result of the company s acquisition of the assets of it group  the company is now a major provider of services to governmental agencies 
as a major provider of these services  the company faces the risks associated with government contracting 
for example  a reduction in spending by federal government agencies could limit the continued funding of existing contracts with these agencies and could limit the company s ability to obtain additional contracts  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the risks of government contracting also include the risk of civil and criminal fines and penalties for violations of applicable regulations and statutes and the risk of public scrutiny of shaw s performance at high profile sites 
as a result of the company s government contracting business  the company has been  is and will be in the future  the subject of audits and or cost reviews by the defense contract audit agency dcaa or by the contracting agency 
additionally  shaw has been and may in the future be  the subject of investigations by governmental agencies such as the epa s office of inspector general 
during the course of an audit  the dcaa may disallow costs if it determines that the company improperly accounted for such costs in a manner inconsistent with cost accounting standards  regulatory and contractual requirements 
under the type of cost reimbursable government contracts that the company typically performs  only those costs that are reasonable  allocable and allowable are recoverable under the federal acquisition regulation and cost accounting standards 
in addition  the failure to comply with the terms of one or more of its government contracts  other government agreements  regulations and statutes could result in shaw s suspension or debarment from future government contract projects for a significant period of time 
this could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business 
actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the company s financial statements 
in order to prepare financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  management is required to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements which affect the reported values of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
areas requiring significant estimates by the company s management  include i contract expenses and profits and application of percentage of completion accounting  ii recoverability of inventory and application of lower of cost or market accounting  iii provisions for uncollectable receivables and customer claims  iv provisions for income taxes and related valuation allowances  v recoverability of net goodwill  vi recoverability of other intangibles and related amortization  vii valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations and viii accruals for estimated liabilities  including litigation and insurance reserves 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company s use of the percentage of completion accounting could result in a reduction elimination of previously reported profits 
as is more fully discussed above in the critical accounting policies and related estimates that have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  a substantial portion of the company s revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion poc method of accounting 
this accounting method is standard for epc contracts 
the poc accounting practices the company utilizes results in the company recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to the company s incurrence of contract costs 
the earnings losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract costs and profitability 
contract losses are recognized in full when determined and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability 
further  a substantial portion of the company s contracts contain various cost and performance incentives penalties that impact the earnings the company realizes from the contracts and adjustments related to incentives penalties are recorded when known or finalized  which is generally during the latter stages of the contract 
although most of the company s contracts are cost reimbursable and the company s financial loss exposure on cost reimbursable contracts is generally limited to a portion of its gross margin  it is possible the loss provisions or adjustments to the contract profit and loss resulting from ongoing reviews or contract penalty provisions could be significant and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings 
in certain circumstances it is possible that such adjustments could be material to the company s operating results 
the company s results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the performance of these contracts 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues are directly or indirectly derived from large scale domestic and international projects 
it is generally very difficult to predict whether and when shaw will receive such awards as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process which is affected by a number of factors  such as market conditions  financing arrangements  governmental approvals and environmental matters 
because a significant portion of the company s revenues are generated from large projects  the company s results of operations can fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of its contract awards 
the uncertainty of the company s contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs 
in some cases  shaw maintains and bears the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than called for under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards 
if an expected contract award is delayed or not received  the company would incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on it 
further  shaw s significant customers vary between years and the loss of any one or more of the company s key customers could have a material adverse impact on it 
in addition  timing of the revenues and earnings from the company s projects can be affected by a number of factors beyond the company s control  including unavoidable delays from weather conditions  unavailability of material and equipment from vendors  changes in the scope of services requested by clients  or labor disruptions 
political and economic conditions in foreign countries in which shaw operates could adversely affect the company 
a significant portion of the company s revenues is attributable to projects in international markets 
shaw expects international revenues and operations to continue to contribute materially to the company s growth and earnings for the foreseeable future 
international contracts  operations and expansion expose the company to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states  including o uncertain economic conditions in the foreign countries in which shaw makes capital investments  operates and sells products and services  o the lack of well developed legal systems in some countries in which shaw operates and sells  o products and services  which could make it difficult for it to enforce the company s contractual rights  o expropriation of property  o restrictions on the right to convert or repatriate currency  and o political risks  including risks of loss due to civil strife  acts of war  guerrilla activities and insurrection 
foreign exchange risks may affect the company s ability to realize a profit from certain projects or to obtain projects 
the company generally attempts to denominate its contracts in united states dollars  however  from time to time the company enters into contracts denominated in a foreign currency 
this practice subjects the company to foreign exchange risks  particularly to the extent contract revenues are denominated in a currency different than the contract costs 
the company attempts to minimize its exposure from foreign exchange risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies  matching the contract revenue currency with the contract costs currency or entering into hedge contracts when there are different currencies for contract revenues and costs 
however  these actions will not always eliminate all foreign exchange risks 
foreign exchange controls may also adversely affect the company 
for instance  prior to the lifting of foreign exchange controls in venezuela in november  foreign exchange controls adversely affected the company s ability to repatriate profits from shaw s venezuelan subsidiary or otherwise convert local currency into united states dollars 
further  the company s ability to obtain international contracts is impacted by the relative strength or weakness of the united states dollar to foreign currencies 
failure to meet schedule or performance requirements of shaw s contracts could adversely affect the company 
in certain circumstances  the company guarantees facility completion by a scheduled acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels 
failure to meet any such schedule or performance requirements could result in additional costs and the amount of such additional costs could exceed project profit margins 
performance problems for existing and future contracts  whether fixed  maximum or unit priced  could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated by the company 
a dependence on one or a few customers could adversely affect the company 
due to the size of many engineering and construction projects  one or a few clients have in the past and may in the future contribute a substantial portion of the company s consolidated revenues in any one year  or over a period of several consecutive years 
for example  the company s backlog frequently reflects multi projects for individual clients and therefore  one major customer may comprise a significant percentage of backlog at a point in time 
additionally  the company has long standing relationships with many significant customers  including customers with whom the company has alliance agreements that have preferred pricing arrangements  however  the company s contracts with them are on a project by project basis and they may unilaterally reduce or discontinue their purchases at any time 
the loss of business from any one of such customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business or results of operations 
shaw s dependence on a few suppliers and subcontractors could adversely affect the company 
the principal raw materials in the company s piping systems business are carbon steel  stainless steel and other alloy piping  which shaw obtains from a number of domestic and foreign primary steel producers 
in the company s engineering  procurement and construction services shaw relies on third party equipment manufacturers or materials suppliers as well as third party subcontractors  to complete its projects 
to the extent that the company cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials  shaw s ability to complete a project in a timely fashion or at a profit may be impaired 
to the extent the amount the company is required to pay for these goods and services exceeds the amount the company has estimated in bidding for fixed price work  shaw could experience losses in the performance of these contracts 
in addition  if a manufacturer is unable to deliver the materials according to the negotiated terms  the company may be required to purchase the materials from another source at a higher price 
this may reduce the profit to be realized or result in a loss on a project for which the materials were needed 
the company s projects expose it to potential professional liability  product liability  or warranty and other claims 
shaw engineers and constructs and performs services in large industrial facilities in which system failures can be disastrous 
any catastrophic occurrences in excess of insurance limits at locations engineered or constructed by the company or where shaw s products are installed or services performed could result in significant professional liability  product liability or warranty and other claims against it 
in addition  under some of the company s contracts  shaw must use new metals or processes for producing or fabricating pipe for its customers 
the failure of any of these metals or processes could result in warranty claims against the company for significant replacement or reworking costs 
further  the engineering and construction projects shaw performs expose it to additional risks including cost overruns  equipment failures  personal injuries  property damage  shortages of materials and labor  work stoppages  labor disputes  weather problems and unforeseen engineering  architectural  environmental and geological problems 
in addition  once the company s construction is complete  shaw may face claims with respect to the performance of these facilities 
the company s environmental infrastructure operations  which will increase substantially as a result of the acquisition of the assets of it group  may subject the company to potential contractual and operational costs and liabilities 
many of shaw s environmental infrastructure segment customers attempt to shift financial and operating risks to the contractor  particularly on projects involving large scale cleanups and or projects where there may be a risk that the contamination could be more extensive or difficult to resolve than previously anticipated 
in this competitive market  customers increasingly try to pressure contractors to accept greater risks of performance  liability for damage or injury to third parties or property and liability for fines and penalties 
prior to its acquisition by the company  the it group was involved in claims and litigation involving disputes over such issues 
therefore  it is possible that the company could also become involved in similar claims and litigation in the future as a result of the company s acquisition of the assets of it group and the company s participation in environmental and infrastructure contracts 
environmental management contractors also potentially face liabilities to third parties for property damage or personal injury stemming from a release of toxic substances resulting from a project performed for customers 
these liabilities could arise long after completion of a project 
although the risks the company faces in its anthrax and other biological agent work are similar to those faced in its toxic chemical emergency response business  the risks posed by attempting to detect and remediate these agents may include risks to the company s employees  subcontractors and those who may be affected should detection and remediation prove less effective than anticipated 
because anthrax and similar contamination is so recent  there may be unknown risks involved  and in certain circumstances there may be no body of knowledge or standard protocols for dealing with these risks 
the risks the company faces also include the potential ineffectiveness of developing technologies to detect and remediate the contamination  claims for infringement of these technologies  the difficulties in working with the smaller  specialized firms that may own these technologies and have detection and remediation capabilities  the company s ability to attract and retain qualified employees and subcontractors in light of these risks  the high profile nature of the work  and the potential unavailability of insurance and indemnification for the risks associated with biological agents and terrorism 
over the past several years  the epa and other federal agencies have constricted significantly the circumstances under which they will indemnify their contractors against liabilities incurred in connection with cercla and similar projects 
the company s competitors may have greater resources and experience than shaw does 
in the company s engineering  procurement and construction business  shaw has numerous regional  national  and international competitors  many of which have greater financial and other resources than shaw does 
the company s competitors include well established  well financed concerns  both privately and publicly held  including many major power equipment manufacturers and engineering and construction companies  some engineering companies  internal engineering departments at utilities and certain of its customers 
because the company is primarily a service organization  shaw competes by providing services of the highest quality 
the markets that shaw serves require substantial resources and particularly highly skilled and experienced technical personnel 
in pipe engineering and fabrication  competition on a domestic and international level is substantial 
in the united states  there are a number of smaller pipe fabricators 
internationally  the company s principal competitors are divisions of large industrial firms 
some of the company s competitors  primarily in the international sector  have greater financial and other resources than shaw does 
the company s environmental infrastructure segment competes with a diverse array of small and large organizations including national or regional environmental management firms  national  regional and local architectural  engineering and construction firms  environmental management divisions or subsidiaries of international engineering  construction and systems companies  and waste generators that have developed in house capabilities 
increased competition in this business  combined with changes in client procurement procedures  has resulted in changes in the industry  among other things lower contract margins  more fixed price or unit price contracts  and contract terms that may increasingly require the company to indemnify its clients against damages or injuries to third parties and property and environmental fines and penalties 
the company believes  therefore  these market conditions may require the company to accept more contractual and performance risk than it has historically done in order for the environmental infrastructure segment to be competitive in this market 
the entry of large systems contractors and international engineering and construction forms into the environmental services industry has increased competition for major federal government contracts and programs  which have been a primary source of revenue in recent years for the environmental and infrastructure business 
the company cannot assure that the environmental infrastructure segment will be able to compete successfully given the intense competition and trends in its industry 
a failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on the company 
the company s ability to attract and retain qualified engineers  scientists and other professional personnel  either through direct hiring or acquisition of other firms employing such professionals  will be an important factor in determining the company s future success 
the market for these professionals is competitive  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to attract and retain such professionals 
in addition  shaw s ability to be successful depends in part on its ability to attract and retain skilled laborers in its pipe fabrication business 
demand for these workers can at times be high and the supply extremely limited 
terrorists actions have and could negatively impact the us economy and the company s markets 
terrorist attacks  such as those that occurred on september   have contributed to economic instability in the united states and further acts of terrorism  violence or war could affect the markets in which the company operates  its business operations  and expectations 
the terrorist attacks on september  have also caused instability in the world s markets 
there can be no assurance that armed hostilities will not increase or that terrorist attacks  or responses from the united states  will not lead to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbances in the united states or elsewhere  which may further contribute to economic instability in the united states 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact the company s physical facilities or those of its suppliers or customers and could impact the company s domestic or international revenues  its supply chain  its production capability  and its ability to deliver its products and services to its customers 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact the company s business 
environmental factors and changes in laws and regulations could increase the company s costs and liabilities and affect the demand for its services 
the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations  including those concerning o emissions into the air  o discharges into waterways  o generation  storage  handling  treatment and disposal of waste materials  and o health and safety 
the company s projects often involve nuclear  hazardous and other highly regulated materials  the improper characterization  handling or disposal of which could constitute violations of federal  state or local statutes  and result in criminal and or civil liabilities 
environmental laws and regulations generally impose limitations and standards for certain pollutants or waste materials and require shaw to obtain a permit and comply with various other requirements 
governmental authorities may seek to impose fines and penalties on the company  or revoke or deny the issuance or renewal of operating permits  for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
in addition  under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla  as amended and comparable state laws  the company may be required to investigate and remediate hazardous substances 
cercla and these comparable state laws typically impose liability without regard to whether a company knew of or caused the release  and liability has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis of allocation 
the principal federal environmental legislation affecting the company s environmental infrastructure subsidiary and its clients include the national environmental policy act of nepa  the resource conservation and recovery act of rcra  the clean air act  the federal water pollution control act and the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of sara 
the company s foreign operations are also subject to various requirements governing environmental protection 
companies that are subject to environmental liabilities have also sought to expand the reach of cercla  rcra and similar state statutes to make contractor firms responsible for cleanup costs 
these companies claim that environmental contractors are owners or operators of hazardous waste facilities or that they arranged for treatment  transportation or disposal of hazardous substances 
if the company is held responsible under cercla or rcra for damages caused while performing services or otherwise  the company may be forced to bear this liability by itself  notwithstanding the potential availability of contribution or indemnification from other parties 
the environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which shaw is subject are constantly changing  and it is impossible to predict the effect of such laws and regulations on the company in the future 
shaw does not yet know the extent  if any of any environmental liabilities associated with many of its properties  including any liabilities associated with the assets the company acquired from stone webster and it group that a fuller investigation might reveal 
the company cannot give any assurance that its operations will continue to comply with future laws and regulations or that these laws and regulations will not significantly adversely affect the company 
the level of enforcement of these laws and regulations also affects the demand for many of the company s services 
proposed changes in regulations and the perception that enforcement of current environmental laws has been reduced has decreased the demand for some services  as clients have anticipated and adjusted to the potential changes 
proposed changes could result in increased or decreased demand for some of the company s services 
the ultimate impact of the proposed changes will depend upon a number of factors  including the overall strength of the economy and clients views on the cost effectiveness of remedies available under the changed regulations 
the company believes these factors have been partially offset by an increased desire on the part of commercial clients for strategic environmental services  which o provide an integrated  proactive approach to environmental issues  and o are driven by economic  as opposed to legal or regulatory concerns 
further  the company believes that by its commercial clients for environmental services may be increased by and dependent upon mergers  acquisitions and other strategic corporate transactions involving those clients  as well as potentially more stringent accounting standards for contingent environmental liabilities 
shaw is exposed to certain risks associated with its environmental liability solutions business 
certain subsidiaries within the company s environmental infrastructure division are engaged in activities that may involve assumption of a client s environmental remediation obligations and potential claim obligations 
the landbank group  inc purchases and repositions environmentally impaired properties while shaw environmental liability solutions  llc will take over responsibility for environmental matters at a particular site or sites  including indemnifications for defined cleanup costs and post closing third party claims  in return for compensation by the client 
these subsidiaries may operate and or purchase and redevelop environmentally impaired property 
as the owner or operator of such properties  the company may be required to clean up all contamination at these sites  even if the company did not place it there 
these risks are mitigated through environmental due diligence  liability protection provisions of federal laws such as the brownfields revitalization act and similar state laws  the purchase of environmental and cost cap insurance coverage or other risk management products 
although the company believes its risk management strategies and these products and laws adequately protect the company against these obligations  the company can provide no assurance that they will do so in all circumstances 
additionally  when one of these companies purchases real estate  it may be subject to many of the same risks as real estate developers  including the timely receipt of building and zoning permits  construction delays  the ability of markets to absorb new development projects  market fluctuations  and the ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing on satisfactory terms  among others 
if shaw has to write off a significant amount of intangible assets  the company s earnings will be negatively impacted 
because the company has grown in part through acquisitions  goodwill and other acquired intangible assets represent a substantial portion of its assets 
goodwill was approximately million as of august  if the company makes additional acquisitions  it is likely that additional intangible assets will be recorded on its books 
a determination that a significant impairment in value of the company s unamortized intangible assets has occurred would require the company to write off a substantial portion of its assets 
such a write off would negatively affect the company s earnings 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company is and will continue to be involved in litigation 
the company has been and may from time to time be named as a defendant in legal actions claiming damages in connection with engineering and construction projects and other matters 
these are typically actions that arise in the normal course of business  including employment related claims and contractual disputes or claims for personal injury or property damage which occur in connection with services performed relating to project or construction sites 
such contractual disputes normally involve claims relating to the performance of equipment  design or other engineering services or project construction services provided by the company s subsidiaries 
while the company did not assume possible liabilities relating to environmental pollution in connection with the it group and the stone webster acquisitions  a federal  state or local governmental authority may seek redress from shaw or its subsidiaries and the company may be named as a potentially responsible party in an action by such governmental authority 
while the company would vigorously contest any attempt to make the company responsible for unassumed environmental liabilities  there can be no assurance that the company would not be held liable in connection with such matters in amounts that would have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
adverse events could negatively affect the company s liquidity position 
the company operates in an environment in which the company could be required to utilize large sums of working capital  sometimes on short notice and sometimes without the ability to recover the expenditures as has been the experience of certain of the company s competitors 
circumstances or events which could create large cash outflows include loss contracts  environmental liabilities  litigation risks  unexpected costs or losses resulting from acquisitions  contract initiation or completion delays  political conditions  customer payment problems  foreign exchange risks  professional and product liability claims  cash repurchases of the company s liquid yield option tm notes due lyons  etc 
although the company attempts to mitigate its risks  it cannot provide assurance that it will have sufficient liquidity or the credit capacity to meet all its cash needs if it encounters significant unforeseen working capital requirements that could result from these or other factors 
insufficient liquidity could have important consequences to the company 
for example  the company could o experience difficulty in financing future acquisitions and or its continuing operations  o be required to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flows from operations to the repayment of its debt and the interest associated with its debt  o have less operating flexibility due to restrictions which could be imposed by its creditors  including restrictions on incurring additional debt  creating liens on its properties and paying dividends  o have less success in obtaining new work if its sureties and or its lenders were to limit its ability to provide new performance bonds or letters of credit for its projects  and o incur increased lending fees  costs and interest rates 
all or any of these matters could place the company at a competitive disadvantage compared with competitors with more liquidity and could have a negative impact upon the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s repurchase obligations under its zero coupon  unsecured convertible notes due lyons could result in adverse consequences 
in may  the company issued million of zero coupon  unsecured convertible notes due lyons 
on may of   and  holders may require the company to purchase all or a portion of these notes at their accreted value 
the company cannot predict whether or when holders will choose to exercise their repurchase rights 
however  it is possible that a substantial portion of the notes may be submitted for repurchase as early as may  the company may  subject to certain conditions  choose to pay the purchase price in cash or in shares of common stock  or in a combination of both 
the company currently intends to repurchase some or all of the securities with cash 
therefore  if a substantial portion of the notes were to be submitted for repurchase on one of the repurchase dates  the company might need to use a substantial amount of its available sources of liquidity for this purpose 
this could have the effect of restricting the company s ability to fund new acquisitions or to meet other future working capital needs  as well as increasing the company s costs of borrowing 
the company may seek other means of refinancing or restructuring its obligations under the notes  but this may result in terms less favorable than those under the existing notes 
further  it is possible that in adverse circumstances  such as a combination of a large number of repurchase requests  low stock price and or liquidity or financing restraints  the company could be required to issue a significant number of shares to satisfy its repurchase obligations and the number of shares actually issued could substantially dilute the common stock 
moreover  sales of such shares in the market place could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
work stoppages and other labor problems could adversely affect the company 
some of the company s employees in the united states and abroad are represented by labor unions 
shaw experienced a strike  without material impact on pipe production  by union members in february  relating to the termination of collective bargaining agreements covering its pipe facilities in walker and prairieville  louisiana 
a lengthy strike or other work stoppage at any of the company s facilities could have a material adverse effect on the company 
from time to time shaw has also experienced attempts to unionize the company s non union shops 
while these efforts have achieved limited success to date  the company cannot give any assurance that it will not experience additional union activity in the future 
changes in technology could adversely affect the company and its competitors may develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology 
the company believes its stone webster subsidiary has a leading position in technologies for the design and construction of ethylene plants 
the company protects it position through patent registrations  license restrictions  and a research and development program 
however  it is possible that others may develop competing processes that could negatively affect the company s market position 
additionally  the company has developed construction and power generation and transmission software  which it feels provide competitive advantages 
the advantages currently provided by this software could be at risk if competitors were to develop superior or comparable technologies 
the company s induction pipe bending technology and capabilities favorably influence the company s ability to compete successfully 
currently this technology and its proprietary software are not patented 
while the company has some legal protections against the dissemination of this know how  including non disclosure and confidentiality agreements  the company s efforts to prevent others from using its technology could be time consuming  expensive and ultimately may be unsuccessful or only partially successful 
finally  there is nothing to prevent the company s competitors from independently attempting to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to shaw s technology 
in shaw s environmental infrastructure business segment  the technology consists principally of the know how of its professionals  and shaw is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified  innovative personnel 
expiration of the price anderson act s paa indemnification authority could have adverse consequences 
the company services the needs of the doe in converting its weapons facilities to civilian purposes and the nuclear power industry in the on going maintenance and modifications as well as decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear power plants 
approximately of the company s backlog is from nuclear services 
shaw expects this portion of its business to continue to grow as many operating power plants require modifications or upgrades or reach the end of their scheduled useful lives over the next years 
the paa promotes and regulates the nuclear power industry in the us the paa comprehensively regulates the manufacture  use and storage of radioactive materials  and promotes the nuclear power industry by offering broad indemnification to nuclear power plant operators and doe contractors 
while the paa s indemnification provisions are broad  it has not been determined whether they apply to all liabilities that might be incurred by a radioactive materials cleanup contractor 
also the paa s ability to indemnify with respect to newly signed contracts expired on august  because nuclear power remains controversial  it is not clear that the paa and its indemnification provisions will be extended 
the company s business could be adversely affected if the paa were not extended due to either the unwillingness of plant operators to retain the company  or the company s inability to obtain adequate indemnification and insurance  because of the unavailability of the protections of the paa 
the company s success depends on key members of its management  including j 
m 
bernhard  jr 
the company s success is dependent upon the continued services of j 
m 
bernhard  jr  its founder  chairman  president and chief executive officer  and other key officers 
the loss of mr 
bernhard or other key officers could adversely affect the company 
the company does not maintain key employee insurance on any of its executive officers 
market prices of the company s equity securities could change significantly 
the market prices of the company s common stock may change significantly in response to various factors and events  beyond the company s control  including the following o the other risk factors described in this form k  including changing demand for its products and services  o a shortfall in operating revenue or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors  o changes in securities analysts estimates of the financial performance of shaw or its competitors or the financial performance of companies in its industry generally  o general conditions in its industries  o general conditions in the securities markets  o issuance of a significant number of shares upon exercise of employee stock options or conversion of the lyons  and o issuance of a significant number of shares of common stock to fund lyons repurchases by the company provisions in the company s articles of incorporation and by laws and rights agreement could make it more difficult to acquire the company and may reduce the market price of the common stock 
the company s articles of incorporation and by laws contain certain provisions  such as a provision establishing a classified board of directors in the event the entire board of directors is increased to twelve or more members  provisions entitling holders of shares of common stock that have been beneficially owned for four years or more to five votes per share  a provision prohibiting shareholders from calling special meetings  a provision requiring super majority voting of the outstanding voting power to approve certain business combinations and provisions authorizing the board of directors to issue up to million shares of preferred stock without approval of the company s shareholders 
also  the company has adopted a rights plan that limits the ability of any person to acquire more than of the company s common stock 
these provisions could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company or the removal of management  of deterring potential acquirers from making an offer to the company s shareholders and of limiting any opportunity to realize premiums over prevailing market prices for the common stock 
provisions of the company s shareholder rights agreement could also have the effect of deterring changes of control of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates  primarily in the united states 
the company s policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and short term fixed rate investments 
the company currently does not use any derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk 
the table below provides information about the company s future maturities of principal for outstanding debt instruments including capital leases and fair value at august  in millions 
fair thereafter total value long term debt fixed rate 
average interest rate variable rate average interest rate short term line of credit variable rate average interest rate as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  on may   the company issued million face value  year  zero coupon unsecured convertible debt liquid yield option tm notes the lyons for which it received net proceeds of approximately million 
after paying off approximately million of outstanding debt  the remaining proceeds were invested in high quality short term cash equivalents and marketable securities held to maturity 
during fiscal  the income realized from these investments was greater than the interest costs associated with the lyons debt 
however  during fiscal interest income was less than its interest expense as a result of the company s utilization of cash for various investments including the it group acquisition  the decline in interest rates available for short term investments  and the amortization of deferred credit costs 
the holders of the lyons have the right to require the company to repurchase the debt on may   may   may   and may  at the accreted value 
therefore  the debt is presented above as maturing on may  because of the potential for repurchase requests by the debt holders at that time 
also during fiscal  the company used the proceeds from the sales of the lyons  the company s common stock see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and various assets to pay off its borrowings under its primary credit facility million at august  
at august   the interest rate on this line of credit was either if the prime rate index had been chosen or if the libor rate index had been chosen with an availability of million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this line of credit 
the estimated fair value of long term debt and capital leases as of august  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the fair value of the convertible debt as of august  was based on recent sales of such debt as of august  the fair value of the company s other long term debt and capital leases at august  and were based on borrowing rates currently available to the company for notes with similar terms and average maturities 
foreign currency risks the majority of the company s transactions are in us dollars  however  certain of the company s subsidiaries conduct their operations in various foreign currencies 
currently  the company  when considered appropriate  uses hedging instruments to manage its risks associated with its operating activities when an operation enters into a transaction in a currency that is different from its local currency 
in these circumstances  the company will frequently utilize forward exchange contracts to hedge the anticipated purchases and or revenues 
the company attempts to minimize its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by matching its revenues and expenses in the same currency for its contracts 
as of august   the company had a minimal number of forward exchange contracts outstanding that were hedges of certain commitments of foreign subsidiaries 
the exposure from the commitments is not material to the company s results of operations or financial position
