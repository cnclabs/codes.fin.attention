item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide pharmacy services to patients on behalf of managed care organizations and other third party payors 
we contract with payors to provide infusion therapy  specialty pharmacy and other related services to patients at home or at other alternate site settings  such as physicians offices 
as of december   our pharmacy and related services are provided locally through our nationwide network of owned and franchised pharmacy locations  and through our three regional specialty pharmacies which operate under the name optionmed 
certain specialty pharmaceuticals may be infused rather than injected  and are therefore dispensed by our company owned local pharmacies 
we operate our business in two segments our local pharmacy division and our regional specialty pharmacy division 
summarized information about revenue in each segment is provided in the following table years ended december  local pharmacy infusion and specialty pharmacy royalties product sales and other total local pharmacy regional specialty pharmacy total revenue most of our revenue is generated from managed care contracts and other agreements with commercial third party payors 
our principal managed care contract is with blue cross and blue shield of florida  inc which contracts with us through our regional pharmacy located in miami  florida 
in  and  approximately  and of our total pharmacy revenue  which is our total revenue other than revenue from royalties  product sales and other revenue  was related to this contract and approximately  and of our regional specialty pharmacy revenue was related to this contract 
as of december  and  approximately of option care s accounts receivable was due from blue cross and blue shield of florida  inc our contract with blue cross and blue shield of florida  inc is terminable by either party on days notice and  unless terminated  renews annually each september for an additional one year term 
in april  we agreed to a reduced pricing schedule 
in september we entered into a new contract with respect to specialty injectable pharmaceuticals which continued the revised pricing and expanded the number of blue cross and blue shield of florida  inc patients to which we may provide pharmaceuticals 
we have begun to implement expanded services under the new contract  and will continue to do so in stages over the next to months 
although we expect the reduced pricing to lower our gross margin  we expect to gradually increase our profitability as we expand our specialty injectable pharmaceutical sales by selling specialty injectable pharmaceuticals to a larger patient population 
for the years  and  respectively  approximately  and of our total pharmacy revenue came from governmental programs such as medicare and medicaid 
as of december  and december   respectively  approximately and of total accounts receivable were due from these programs 
many governmental payors reimburse us for some pharmaceuticals based on that pharmaceutical s average wholesale price 
in many cases  we purchase pharmaceuticals at less than average wholesale price 
average wholesale price for most pharmaceuticals is compiled and published by private companies  including first databank  inc it has been reported that there are currently several lawsuits pending against manufacturers of certain pharmaceuticals 
these government investigations and lawsuits involve allegations that manufacturers have misrepresented to first databank the actual selling price of certain pharmaceuticals 
first databank has announced that it will now base average wholesale prices on market prices certified by the manufacturer 
as a result of this change  first databank has published a market price survey that reduces the average wholesale price significantly for a number of the products we currently supply to patients 
if the average wholesale prices on the products we purchase are reduced  our gross profit margins could decline 
we have been reducing the number of our franchised locations since to increase operational efficiency  most often by consolidating  terminating or acquiring franchises 
however  since  royalty revenue has been fairly stable 
any losses in royalty revenue due to the reduction in number of franchises have been substantially offset by increased royalty revenue generated by the continuing franchises 
during  we completed nine acquisitions  providing us with entry into ten new markets and expanding our presence in three existing markets 
the aggregate purchase price at closing for these acquisitions was million  of which million was paid in cash and  is payable in approximately  shares of common stock 
another  was paid as additional consideration based on the current year s financial performance of the acquired offices  and million is payable as of december  on our and prior acquisitions 
up to an additional  will be payable in cash through if certain financial targets are met 
acquisitions constitute an integral part of our growth strategy and we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and their related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  option care evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable 
actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we annually review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to our financial condition and results of operations  as well as our current business environment 
option care management believes that of our significant accounting policies  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity 
revenue recognition our revenue is primarily derived from the sale of infusible and injectible pharmaceuticals and provision of related nursing services to patients at alternate site settings 
most of this revenue is billed under managed care or other contracts  while virtually all of the remainder is billed under government programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
billed and unbilled revenue is recorded net of contractual adjustments based on our interpretation of the terms of each managed care contract or government contract pricing schedule 
the accuracy of our recorded net revenue is subject to the accuracy of payor information on file for each patient  and is also subject to our correct interpretation of each underlying contract with respect to reimbursement rates for the drugs and services we provided 
if changes are subsequently required to either payor information or our interpretation of the reimbursement rates of our contracts  we adjust revenue in the period that such changes are identified 
such adjustments may have a positive or negative impact on the revenues and results of operations reported for those subsequent periods 
historically  such adjustments have not been significant to the statements of operations 
accounts receivables we record our accounts receivables net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
this allowance is estimated based on several factors  including our past accounts receivable collection history  consideration of the age of the accounts receivable at the end of each period  and detailed analysis of the expected collectibility of amounts receivable from each significant payor based on a number of factors 
the allowance also considers the fact that in certain circumstances  our accounts receivable may also be subject to retroactive adjustments by payors 
although we believe that our estimation of the net value of our accounts receivable is reasonable  actual collections may differ from our estimates of collectibility  affecting our future financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets we record goodwill from our acquisitions equal to the excess of the total cost of the acquisitions over the fair value of all identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
with the exception of goodwill from acquisitions completed after june   we have amortized goodwill on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives of to years 
option care has performed annual reviews of our goodwill for impairment based on a number of factors  including future undiscounted cash flows and changes in economic and market conditions 
as of december   no impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets was identified 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  effective as of july   and sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
we will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill in the first quarter of application of the nonamortization provisions of sfas no 
is expected to result in an annual increase in net income of  or per share 
during  option care will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill as of january  and has not yet determined what the effect of these tests will be on the results of operations and financial position of our company 
results of operations the following table shows certain statement of income items expressed as a percentage of revenue for the years ended december   and years ended december  revenue cost of revenue local pharmacy regional specialty pharmacy total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative provision for doubtful accounts amortization of goodwill total operating expenses operating income other expenses other expense  net interest expense total other expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income years ended december  and our revenue increased by from million in to million in this million growth in revenue during was primarily from sales by local pharmacies acquired in and  and increased sales of infusion therapy and specialty pharmacy drugs and services in both our local pharmacy division and our regional specialty pharmacy division 
approximately million  or  of the growth was attributable to our local pharmacy division 
of this increase  million  or  was attributable to sales by local pharmacies acquired in and the remaining million  or increase was due to same store sales growth 
at our regional specialty pharmacies  revenue increased  or million  primarily due to higher sales volume under our contract with blue cross and blue shield of florida 
royalty fees  software sales and support and other revenues declined by  or  in versus a reduction in new sales of management by information software products was the primary reason for this decline 
our gross profit of million represented an increase of million  or  over this increase was primarily attributed to the million increase in revenues 
however  as a percentage of revenue  our gross profit margin declined from in to in this decrease is due to the stronger growth in sales of specialty pharmaceuticals in both of our segments relative to sales of home infusion drugs and services 
specialty pharmaceuticals are higher cost  lower margin products  and therefore generate a lower gross profit percentage than our infusion therapy products 
the growth of sales of specialty pharmaceuticals in our local pharmacy segment caused our gross profit margin in that segment to decline from in to in our regional specialty pharmacy segment s gross profit margin also declined  from in to in a reduced pricing schedule under option care s contract with blue cross and blue shield of florida  which became effective at the beginning of the second quarter of  was the primary cause of this decline in gross profit margin percentage 
however  due to increased sales volume  the gross profit generated by our regional specialty pharmacy segment increased by  over the prior year 
total operating expenses increased by million  or  in compared to the prior year 
approximately million of this increase can be attributed to our acquisitions completed in and  consisting of the operating expenses incurred directly by those newly acquired offices and the incremental increase in corporate staffing required to manage them 
the remaining million increase was due to a variety of factors  including increases in the cost of providing health insurance to our employees  and increases in staffing and various other operating expenses necessary to manage increased revenues and patient volume 
our provision for doubtful accounts increased by million  or  from to this increase is directly related to the increase in revenue over this period 
as a percentage of revenue  the provision for doubtful accounts increased from in to in this slight increase was due to the greater increase in local pharmacy revenue relative to regional specialty pharmacy revenue in the increase was expected 
our local pharmacies typically incur a slightly higher level of bad debts than our regional specialty pharmacies because of having to bill proportionately more claims to more payors to generate the same revenues 
goodwill amortization expense increased by  due to additional goodwill resulting from our acquisitions and additional consideration paid on our   and acquisitions 
our interest expense of million for was  higher than the million incurred in the increase was primarily due to expenditures for the purchase price and initial operating cash needs of business we acquired in  which increased debt until the completion of our underwritten public offering of stock in october the income tax provision increased million  or  for versus this increase was primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes from to income taxes were provided for at a rate in compared to in this increase in our income tax rate was primarily due to our increase in income before income taxes  which increased our federal income tax rate from to 
also  we expanded our operations in some states with relatively higher state income tax rates  which placed upward pressure on our overall tax rate 
we recorded net income of million in  which represents an increase of million  or  over the million in net income equaled of revenue in compared to of revenue in this decline in net income as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the increase in sales of specialty pharmaceutical products in our local pharmacy division 
specialty pharmaceuticals are higher cost  lower margin drugs than our home infusion products  and therefore produce a lower net income percentage 
another factor contributing to the decline in net income as a percentage of revenue was the price reductions under our managed care contract with blue cross and blue shield of florida 
as a result of the increase in net income  earnings per diluted share increased  from in to in our increase in net income more than offset the increase in diluted shares outstanding 
the increase in diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to the weighted average impact of our issuance of  new shares of common stock in october through an underwritten public offering 
other factors increasing our diluted shares outstanding included stock option exercises and the issuance of shares under option care s employee stock purchase plan 
net cash flow used by operations in was million  compared to million provided by operations in of the million use of cash by operations  million was used to fund the operational cash needs of local pharmacies acquired in and in all but one of these acquisitions  we did not purchase the existing accounts receivable 
therefore  our million use of cash by our acquisitions can be directly attributed to the million buildup of accounts receivable from their operations after purchase 
in addition to the million increase in accounts receivable attributed to our acquisitions  another million of increase in accounts receivable came from the growth in revenues of our ongoing operations 
these ongoing operations provided million in operating cash flows in  primarily due to their overall profitability 
net cash flow used in investing activities for was million  compared to million in we used million in the year for acquisitions  of which million consisted of cash payments for the nine asset purchase agreements signed in  and  was for additional consideration on prior years acquisitions 
option care also used million for the purchase of equipment and fixed assets  which includes million used to pay for new assets  less  provided by the sale and retirement of assets 
of the million used to buy new assets  million was spent on new software development projects  million was spent for infrastructure improvements  such as new computer and office equipment  and  was spent for rental medical equipment 
the remaining  provided by investing activities was generated from the sale of various other assets 
financing activities provided million in cash in by contrast  in  million was provided 
in october  we completed an underwritten public offering of common stock 
this offering generated approximately million in net proceeds  which accounts for the majority of the million of cash provided in by the issuance of common stock 
the remaining million came from employee withholdings for purchase of shares under the employee stock purchase plan  and from the exercise of stock options 
in addition to providing million in cash  the underwritten public offering allowed us to repay the outstanding balance on our credit facility  which was million as of december  finally  we used  in cash to reduce our cash overdraft to zero as of december   as we had a positive cash balance of million on that date 
years ended december  and our revenue increased by from million in to million in the million of revenue growth during was primarily in infusion therapy and specialty pharmacy in both our local pharmacy division and our regional specialty pharmacy division 
approximately million of the growth was attributable to infusion therapy and specialty pharmacy sales in our local pharmacy division  of which approximately million was due to business acquisitions in in the cities of bellingham  washington  sterling  virginia and hemet  california 
the remaining million increase during was due to same store sales growth over at our regional specialty pharmacies  revenue increased  or million primarily due to new managed care contracts  improved marketing of existing products and services and distribution of new products 
royalty revenue increased by due to same store growth within our franchise network 
our gross profit of million represented an increase of million  or  over this increase can be directly attributed to the million year to year increase in revenue 
however  the overall gross profit percentage decreased from in to in this decrease is due to the stronger growth of our specialty pharmacy sales relative to sales in our infusion business 
specialty injectable pharmaceuticals are higher cost  lower margin products  and therefore  generate a lower gross profit percentage than our infusion therapy products 
our regional specialty pharmacy gross profit percentage in was  as compared to a gross profit percentage of for our local pharmacy division 
the faster growth rate of our regional specialty pharmacy division over the local pharmacy division accounts for our overall decline in gross profit percentage 
the regional specialty pharmacy division gross profit percentage was  while the local pharmacy division gross profit percentage was 
for both divisions  the year to year decrease was due to an increase in higher cost  lower margin pharmaceutical sales 
total operating expenses of million were approximately equal to operating expenses of million 
this fact  combined with our million increase in revenue  resulted in a decline in operating expenses to of revenue in compared to in there are several reasons for this decline 
the increase in revenue in over came primarily from within our existing operations and facilities 
therefore  we incurred no direct increase in overhead expenses resulting from the increase in revenue 
also  while administrative wages and related costs increased by million  this increase was offset by reductions in other general and administrative expenses 
our provision for doubtful accounts decreased by  from of revenue in to in goodwill amortization expense increased by  due to additional goodwill resulting from our acquisitions and additional payments on our and acquisitions 
interest expense in was million  which was approximately equal to the million in in  positive operating cash flows of million from continuing operations were offset by payments for acquisitions of million  which consist of approximately million for new businesses and million for additional payments on and acquisitions 
this resulted in a similar average credit line borrowing balance between the two years  and thus similar interest expense 
the income tax provision increased million  or  for versus this increase was primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes from to income taxes were provided for at a rate in compared to in the reduction in the income tax rate in versus was due to a re evaluation of our overall state tax liabilities  as well as from the favorable resolution of various tax matters previously reserved for as potential liabilities 
we recorded net income of million in  which represents an increase of million or  over net income equaled of revenue in compared to of revenue in as a result of the increase in net income  earnings per diluted share increased to in versus in the increase in earnings per share that resulted from our increase in net income was offset by a increase in diluted shares outstanding 
this increase was mostly due to the issuance of new shares of stock for three purposes i payment of stock earnouts under the terms of and acquisitions agreements  ii exercise of non qualified stock options by employees and former employees  and iii issuance of shares to employees who participated in our employee stock purchase plan 
net cash flow provided by operations for was million  a small increase from the million of cash flow provided by operations in while net income increased by million in versus  accounts receivable increased by million  or  due to the fact that fourth quarter revenue of million exceeded fourth quarter revenue of million  or  nearly the same increase 
this increase in accounts receivable was partially offset by a million decrease in inventory 
december  inventories had been increased as a precautionary measure related to year planning  and also to obtain favorable price reductions based on volume purchases of certain products 
no such temporary inventory increases existed as of december   therefore resulting in a decrease in inventory value compared to the prior year 
changes in other assets and liabilities accounted for the remainder of the year to year change in operating cash flows 
net cash flow used in investing activities for was million  compared to million in the million increase was primarily due to approximately million in cash payments for our acquisitions 
another million related to payment of additional obligations under our and acquisition agreements compared to million paid in the remaining increase in cash flow used in investing activities consisted of a  increase in capital expenditures and  in additions to other assets  which included loan origination fees paid for securing our million term loan  as well as expenditures for development of our optionmed web site 
net cash flow provided by financing activities was million in versus net cash flow used by financing activities of million in repayments of debt under our revolving credit facility in due to strong operating cash flows was the reason for the million cash flow usage in that year 
payments for our acquisitions and for obligations related to our and acquisitions exceeded our net operating cash flow 
therefore  the total outstanding obligations under our credit facility increased  resulting in million of net cash flow being provided by financing activities 
quarterly information the following table presents certain quarterly statement of income data for the years ended december  and the quarterly statement of income data set forth below was derived from our unaudited financial statements and includes all adjustments  consisting of normal recurring adjustments  which we consider necessary for a fair presentation thereof

q q q q q q q q revenue       gross profit      income before income taxes      net income       basic income per share diluted income per share liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations and acquisitions from operating cash flows and borrowings 
our principal demands for liquidity are working capital  acquisition activities and debt service 
as of december   our credit facility with ge capital commercial finance  inc provided for a secured revolving facility of up to million 
we repaid all existing balances on our revolving line of credit upon completion of the sale of  shares of common stock through an underwritten public offering in october this facility expired in february on march   we entered into a million revolving credit and security agreement with jp morgan business credit corp  which will serve as advisor  jp morgan chase bank  which will serve as administrator  collateral agent and arranger  and lasalle bank  national association  which will serve as co agent 
the facility requires us to meet certain financial covenants 
option care paid a facility fee of approximately  upon signing the agreement 
the agreement provides for a commitment fee  calculated and paid quarterly on a sliding scale from to  based on the average daily unused portion of the facility 
for a fee  option care may secure up to million in letters of credit 
depending on our level of borrowing under the agreement  option care may select interest rates ranging from the eurodollar rate plus to  or the bank s reference rate plus to 
the agreement expires on march  availability under the facility is related to various percentages of option care s net outstanding accounts receivable and inventory balances  less certain capped and ineligible amounts  as defined in the agreement 
overall borrowings under the agreement will be limited to the lesser of the remaining availability under the agreement and the total allowable collateral borrowing base 
the facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
in addition to customary events of default  the facility provides that a change in control of our company would give rise to an event of default 
as of december   we had working capital of million  compared to million as of december  this million increase was primarily due to the effect of the underwritten public offering of stock completed in october  which generated million in cash 
the difference between the million generated by the stock offering and the million increase in total working capital can be primarily attributed to the million we paid for businesses we acquired in we intend to fund our future capital needs through operating cash flows and borrowings on our new credit facility 
in the event that additional capital is required beyond the limitation of our new credit facility  we may not be able to obtain such capital from other sources on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our business strategy includes the selective acquisition of additional local pharmacy facilities 
accordingly  we may require additional capital in order to make these acquisitions 
it is impossible to predict the amount of capital that may be required for acquisitions  and there is no assurance that sufficient financing for these activities will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing and cash management activities 
we utilize a mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly  we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in as of december  and  our fixed rate debt was  and  and our corresponding variable rate debt was and million 
since we had no variable rate debt as of december   our market risk was zero
