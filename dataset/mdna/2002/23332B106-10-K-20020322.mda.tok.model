item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations year was a challenging year for dsp group 
however  despite the global economic downturn  the september events and the challenges faced by companies operating in the telecommunication and semiconductors markets in  we were among the few companies that demonstrated growth in their top line  and recorded operating and net profits of and of revenues  respectively 
in the second quarter of  we successfully launched our new generation of cordless telephony products  mhz narrow band 
our liquidity continued to improve throughout and by year end  we achieved new record highs for dsp group with respect to cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and short term bank deposits 
such increases were derived primarily from increased revenues and reduced operating working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
our future operating results will be dependent upon a variety of factors 
in evaluating our business  you should carefully consider the information set forth under the caption risk factors and in other sections of this annual report on form k 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  taxes on income  financing operations  warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize product revenue using the guidance from sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements and statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revenue recognition when right of return exists 
we recognize software revenue in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
we periodically consider arrangements regarding certain customers with payment terms extending beyond customary payment terms not to be fixed or determinable 
we also record estimated reductions to revenue for product returns 
if our customers return more products than we estimate  additional reductions to revenue may be required 
in addition  we defer revenue associated with long term customer maintenance contracts 
the value of these contracts is recognized ratably over the length of the customer contract 
inventory 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
investments in available for sale marketable equity securities audiocodes ltd 
and tomen corporation 
we classify these investment securities as available for sale securities 
pursuant to sfas no 
 such securities are measured at fair market value in the financial statements with unrealized gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive income until the securities are sold or otherwise disposed of 
however  in accordance with sfas no 
 a decline in fair market value below cost that is other than temporary is accounted for as a realized loss 
total revenues 
our total revenues were million in  million in and million in this represents an increase in total revenues of in as compared to total revenues in  and an increase of in total revenues in as compared to those in the increase in revenues in as compared to was primarily the result of strong demand for our mh narrow band chip set

in  we witnessed a challenging environment in the telecommunication and semiconductors industries  resulting in longer sales cycles and delays in the purchase decision making processes of potential customers for our dsp core technology 
this resulted in fewer number of new license agreements executed in  as compared to  and limited business visibility for future license agreements 
export sales  primarily consisting of integrated digital telephony idt speech processors shipped to manufacturers in europe and asia  including japan  as well as license fees on dsp cores to foreign customers  represented of our total revenues in  as compared to in and in the increase in export sales in as compared to was primarily due to higher sales to the japanese market especially idt product sales and less sales to the american market especially in our licensing activities 
all export sales are denominated in us dollars 
significant customers 
revenues from one distributor  tomen electronics  accounted for of our total revenues in as compared to in and in the slight increase in as compared to is primarily due to a greater number of sales in japan 
the loss of tomen electronics or one or more of our other major distributors or customers could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of total revenues was in  in and in the decrease in total gross profit in as compared to was due to a change in the product mix associated with the introduction of our new cordless chip set and an inventory write off of approximately million associated with our old line of products consisting of ct and d product gross profit as a percentage of product sales was in  in and in in each of these years  we managed to partially offset the continued decline in average selling prices of our products with a reduction in manufacturing costs  partially due to technological improvements 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased significantly to million in  from million in and million in the increase in research and development expenses in as compared to those in were primarily due to the hiring of additional engineers associated with our voip and rf ghz cmos design projects

a write off of million was recorded relating to the acquired in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of approximately of the outstanding shares of voicepump 
an expense of million was recorded reflecting the accelerated amortization of acquired assets and intangibles related to the acquisition of mhz rf and baseband technology from applied micro devices  inc we did not record any unusual items in or interest and other income expense 
interest and other income and interest and other expenses  net  decreased slightly to income of million in from income of million in interest and other income net of interest expenses was million in the decrease in interest and other income net of interest expense in as compared to was a result of overall lower market interest rates in  off set by higher levels of cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and short term bank deposits in the increase in interest income in as compared to  was a result of higher levels of cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and short term bank deposits in  mainly due to additional sales of a portion of our equity investment in audiocodes  as well as higher yields on our financial investments in equity in earnings of affiliate

all shares and per share numbers with respect to audiocodes have been adjusted to reflect the for stock split effected by audiocodes in october provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was for  excluding tax on capital gain for and for the tax rate for was higher compared to  due to relative decrease in income subject to foreign tax holiday benefits 
the tax rate for was higher compared to  due mainly to our higher utilization of foreign tax holiday benefits in dsp group ltd  our israeli subsidiary  has been granted approved enterprise status by the israeli government according to five investment plans 
the approved enterprise status allows for a tax holiday for a period of two to four years and a reduced corporate tax rate of for an additional six or eight years  on the respective investment plans proportionate share of taxable income 
the tax benefits under these investment plans are scheduled to gradually expire starting from through to our management has assessed the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets and has concluded that it is more likely than not that million deferred tax assets will be realized based on current levels of future taxable income and potentially refundable taxes 
related party transactions 
from and until  we engaged in a development and licensing agreement with audiocodes 
under the agreement  audiocodes performed certain research and development services for us for which we paid audiocodes a service fee 
we also paid audiocodes royalty fees realized from the sale of our products that incorporated their technology 
in addition  we were a supplier of chips to audiocodes for which we received  in for more information about our various arrangements with audiocodes  see note to the attached notes to consolidated financial statement for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources during  we generated million of cash and cash equivalents from our operating activities  as compared to million during and million in the significant increase in of cash and cash equivalents as compared to occurred even though we experienced a significant decrease in net income in as compared to the increase was due mainly to the non cash effects of the capital gains attributed to the sale of audiocodes common stock  an increase in deferred income tax  net  and a decrease in our trade receivables 
the significant increase in of cash and cash equivalents was partially offset by the decrease in amortization of the in process research and development costs in connection with the voicepump acquisition  as well as decrease in trade payable  income tax payable and accrued expenses and other accounts payable 
the increase in of cash and cash equivalents as compared to was due mainly to the non cash effects of the write off of the in process research and development costs in connection with the voicepump acquisition and the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the increase in of cash and cash equivalents over was partially offset by the decrease in deferred income taxes  as well as to the increase in income tax payable 
we invest excess cash in short term bank deposits and marketable securities of varying maturity  depending on our projected cash needs for operations  capital expenditures and other business purposes 
in  we purchased million of investments classified as short term cash deposits and marketable securities  as compared to million in and million in in addition  million of our investments classified as marketable securities matured in as compared to million in and million in during and  the average maturity for our investments was approximately months and months  respectively 
our capital equipment purchases amounted to million in  million in and million in for computer hardware and software used in engineering development  engineering test and lab equipment  leasehold improvements  vehicles  and furniture and fixtures 
in september  we invested approximately  million yen in exchange for stock in our japanese distributor s parent company  tomen corporation  as part of a long term strategic relationship 
tomen s shares are traded on the japanese stock exchange  and are recorded in other investments on the balance sheets  and accounted for as available for sale marketable equity securities 
as of december   the fair market value of our investment in tomen was approximately  on february   we issued and sold million shares pre split of our common stock  which represented of our outstanding common stock at the time of the transaction  to magnum technologies ltd  an international investment fund  for an aggregate net proceeds to us of million 
in february and august  magnum sold million shares of its holdings 
in august magnum sold  shares of our common stock 
in the beginning of  magnum sold  shares of our common stock 
after the sales  magnum currently holds approximately million shares  representing approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock as of march  cash received upon the exercise of employee stock options and through purchases pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan in totaled million  as compared to million in and million in stock repurchase program 
in march  our board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional  shares of our common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  thereby increasing the total shares authorized to be repurchased by the company to  shares 
accordingly  during the year  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share  for an aggregated purchase price of million 
in  we issued  shares of our common stock to employees who exercised their stock options 
at december   our principal source of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalent and cash deposits totaling million and held to maturity marketable securities and short term bank deposits totaling million 
our working capital at december  was million 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  cash deposits and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through at least the next months 
a decrease in our sales or demand for products incorporating our technology would likely affect our working capital amounts 
as part of our business strategy  we occasionally evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies 
accordingly  a portion of our available cash may be used at any time for the acquisition of complementary products or businesses 
such potential transactions may require substantial capital resources  which may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that we will consummate any such transactions 
see risk factors there are risks associated with our acquisition strategy for more detailed information 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
interest rate risk 
it is our policy not to enter into interest rate derivative financial instruments  except for hedging of foreign currency exposures discussed below 
we do not currently have any significant interest rate exposure since we do not have any financial obligation and our financial assets are measured on a held to maturity basis 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
as a significant part of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars  we have experienced only insignificant foreign exchange gains and losses to date  and do not expect to incur significant gains and losses in however  due to the recent increase in the volatility of the exchange rate of the nis versus us dollar  we decided to hedge part of the risk of a devaluation of the nis which could have an adverse effect on the expenses that we incur in the state of israel 
for example  to protect against the increase in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from salary payments during the year  we instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program 
at the end of first quarter of year  we started to purchase put option contracts and entered into forward contracts to hedge a portion of the anticipated nis payroll of our israeli subsidiary for a period of two to ten months 
these options contracts are designated as cash flow hedges  as defined by sfas no 
 and are all effective as hedges of these expenses 
as of december   we recorded a comprehensive loss amounting to thousands which derives from our forward contracts in respect to anticipated payroll payments expected in the year such amounts will be recorded in earnings in for more information about our hedging activity  see note to the attached notes to consolidated financial statement for the year ended december  european monetary union 
within europe  the european economic and monetary union the emu introduced a new currency  the euro  on january  effective january   all emu countries are expected to be operating with the euro as their single currency 
we have assessed the effect the euro formation has on our internal systems and the sale of our products and believe that the cost related to the euro conversion is not material to us and will not have a substantial effect on our financial condition and results of operations
