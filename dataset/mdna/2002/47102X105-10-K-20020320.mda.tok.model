competition stilwell s subsidiaries and equity investments compete with mutual fund advisors  brokerage and investment banking firms  insurance companies  banks  and other financial institutions in many aspects of business 
the marketplace for investment products is increasingly fragmented with a growing number of sophisticated investors and a wide variety of new investment opportunities 
janus and berger compete with hundreds of other mutual fund management  distribution and service companies that distribute their fund shares through a variety of methods including affiliated and unaffiliated sales forces  broker dealers and direct sales to the public 
competition for janus and berger is based on the ability to achieve superior investment management performance  the methods of distribution of fund shares  the ability to meet the changing needs of investors  the type and quality of shareowner services and the success of marketing efforts 
nelson competes in the united kingdom with other financial advisers and investment managers in obtaining new client business 
competition for nelson is based on the ability to achieve reasonable investment management returns  the quality of investor services and the success of marketing efforts 
dst competes with third party providers  in house systems and broker dealers for the provision of processing services 
dst s ability to compete is based on  among other things  the quality of service and features offered  including the ability to handle rapidly changing transaction volumes  commitment to hardware capacity and software development and price 
competition in the mutual fund industry continues to increase as a result of greater flexibility afforded to banks and other financial institutions to sponsor mutual funds and distribute mutual fund shares  and as a result of consolidation and acquisition activity within the industry 
in addition  the mutual fund industry  in general  faces significant competition as marketing and distribution channels become more creative and complex  alternative product types such as hedge funds  exchange traded funds and separate accounts are developed and investors place greater emphasis on published fund recommendations and investment category rankings 
barriers to entry to the investment management business are relatively low 
the mutual fund industry as a whole also faces increasing competition from broker dealers  banks and other intermediaries that are aggressively promoting various products  technologies and services to facilitate portfolio planning and direct securities investments by customers 
employees as of december   janus had approximately  employees  smi and berger had approximately employees  nelson had approximately employees and stilwell financial inc had employees 
none of these employees are represented by a labor union 
relations between stilwell and the management of janus have been strained  primarily as the result of disagreements over the structure of the spin off from kcsi 
prior to the spin off  a number of minority stockholders and employees of janus  including members of janus management  its chief executive officer  its former chief investment officer  five of the six directors of janus and others proposed that kcsi consider a spin off of janus in addition to the spin off of stilwell 
the kcsi board of directors ultimately rejected this proposal 
press reports have appeared in which certain janus employees expressed objections to the stilwell spin off and other disagreements with the structure and direction 
while stilwell and janus have attempted to resolve some of these disagreements  not all disagreements have been resolved 
continuation of these strained relations could result in the loss of key janus employees and janus management  which could have a material adverse effect on stilwell 
the portfolio managers and other key employees of janus are not subject to any non compete agreements that would preclude them from participating in a competing financial services business  although they are subject to agreements that prohibit them for a specific period of time following the end of their employment from soliciting any investment advisory or investment management clients of janus or hiring or soliciting employees to leave the employ of janus 
it is also possible that the publicity surrounding the disagreements between stilwell and members of janus management and employees could have an adverse effect on janus business and on the ability to attract or retain qualified personnel 
risk factors certain statements provided by stilwell in this annual report on form k and in future filings with the sec  in press releases and in oral statements made with the approval of an authorized officer of stilwell  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements are typically identified by the use of words such as may  will  expect  believe  anticipate  intend  could  estimate  or continue and similar expressions or variations  and are based on the beliefs and assumptions of stilwell management based on information currently available to management 
such forward looking statements are subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements include the risks described below and elsewhere in this report 
stilwell cautions readers to carefully consider such factors 
further  such forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made  stilwell undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements 
any decrease in the value of stilwell s assets under management would adversely affect revenues and profits 
because most of stilwell s revenues are related directly to the value of the assets under management by subsidiaries janus  berger and nelson  any decline in the value or amount of those assets would have an adverse effect on revenues 
assets under management may decline for various reasons  many of which are not under stilwell or its subsidiaries control 
factors that could decrease assets under management and therefore revenues include the following o declines in the market value of the assets in the funds and accounts managed by janus  berger or nelson 
this could be caused by price declines in the securities markets generally or in the market segments in which those assets are concentrated 
the assets under management of stilwell s subsidiaries are concentrated in the us equity markets and to a lesser extent in the international equity markets 
the effect of market price declines will be compounded if the funds and accounts managed by janus  berger and nelson under perform the applicable market or segment 
o redemptions and other withdrawals from the funds and accounts managed by janus  berger or nelson 
this could be caused by investors reducing their investments in mutual funds in general or in the market segments that are the focus of stilwell s subsidiaries in response to adverse market conditions or to pursue other investment opportunities  for example  investors taking profits from their investments  or poor investment performance of the funds and accounts managed by stilwell s subsidiaries  which could cause investors to move funds to other investment managers 
favorable performance by the us securities markets in the late s attracted a substantial inflow of investments to the us mutual fund industry and resulted in significant appreciation in the market value of the assets held by funds during the period 
however  markets during and retreated from the record years recently experienced  with the each of the major indices the s p index  nasdaq and dow jones industrial average falling in and the growth rates of stilwell s subsidiaries and equity investments have varied from year to year  and management does not currently expect the high average growth rates sustained in the late s to be repeated in the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance that decreases in assets under management similar to those experienced during will not continue in future periods 
in addition  in  janus closed five funds to new investors  including its flagship janus fund  and these closings could affect the level of cash inflows experienced by janus 
the results of dst are also subject to the performance of the us mutual fund industry because dst derives a substantial portion of its revenues from the delivery of services and products to us mutual fund industry clients 
any event affecting the mutual fund industry that results in a significant decline in the number of shareowner accounts could have a material adverse effect on dst s business 
for any period in which revenues decline  stilwell s profits and profit margins may decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses remain relatively fixed 
if stilwell is unable to attract and retain key personnel  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s future success 
stilwell s business is similar to other investment management businesses in that it is dependent on the ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled  and often highly specialized  technical and management personnel 
although stilwell expects that mr 
thomas h 
bailey will continue to serve as a director and chief executive officer of janus after the termination of his management rights on april   a formal succession plan in the event of a departure from janus by mr 
bailey has not yet been fully developed 
there can be no assurance that an adequate succession plan will be effected or that the loss of mr 
bailey s services  or the services of senior portfolio managers  for any reason would not have an adverse effect on janus and stilwell 
furthermore  relations between janus and stilwell were strained primarily as a result of disagreements over the structure of the spin off of stilwell to kcsi s common stockholders that was completed on july  continuation of these strained relations could result in the loss of key janus employees or other management personnel or impair the ability to attract new personnel

stilwell may not have the funds necessary to purchase the convertible notes that were issued in april  which may be put to stilwell at the option of the holders or upon a change in control 
on april       and  holders of stilwell s convertible notes may require stilwell to purchase all or a portion of the notes 
based on the recent trading price of the convertible notes  management believes it is likely that the convertible notes will be put to the company on april  it is possible that stilwell would not have sufficient funds at the time of each put  including the april  put  to make the required purchase of the notes 
stilwell may need to borrow under its credit facilities  if available at each put date  if purchase of all the notes were required  however  and the credit facilities could be unavailable or limited if covenants or requirements of the credit facilities are not satisfied see risk factors stilwell s credit facilities impose restrictions on the ability to conduct business and may not be sufficient to satisfy capital and operating requirements below 
stilwell may be required to pay all or a portion of the purchase price in shares of stilwell common stock  subject to satisfying the conditions in the indenture for making such payments  which could have the effect of diluting existing stockholders 
if stilwell were unable to satisfy the conditions in the indenture to use common stock to pay the purchase price  and if sufficient cash were not available to stilwell to repurchase the notes  stilwell could be in default of its obligations on the convertible notes 
in addition  upon the occurrence of certain specific kinds of change in control events occurring on or before april   stilwell may be required to purchase for cash all outstanding convertible notes 
however  it is possible that upon a change in control stilwell would not have sufficient funds to make the required purchase or that restrictions in stilwell s credit facilities or other indebtedness would not allow those purchases 
increased competition could reduce the demand for the products and services of stilwell s subsidiaries  which could have a material adverse effect on the respective companies business  financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
stilwell and its subsidiaries are subject to substantial and growing competition in all aspects of business 
such competition could reduce the demand for the products and services of stilwell s subsidiaries and could have a material adverse effect on stilwell s business  financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
janus  berger and nelson compete with hundreds of other mutual fund management and distribution companies that distribute their fund shares through a variety of methods 
although no one company or group of companies dominates the financial services industry  many are larger  better known  have greater resources and offer investors a more diverse group of funds to choose from  than stilwell and its subsidiaries do 
stilwell believes that competition in the mutual fund industry will increase as a result of  among other reasons  the following a increased flexibility afforded to banks and other financial institutions to sponsor mutual funds and distribute mutual fund shares  b consolidation and acquisition activity within the industry  c marketing and distribution channels becoming more creative and complex  d the development of alternative product types  such as hedge funds  exchange traded funds and separate accounts  and e investors placing greater emphasis on published fund recommendations and investment category rankings 
the mutual fund industry as a whole also faces increasing competition from activities designed to facilitate portfolio planning and direct securities investments by customers 
see competition 
stilwell s credit facilities impose restrictions on the ability to conduct business and may not be sufficient to satisfy capital and operating requirements 
stilwell s credit facilities contain covenants that  among other things  restrict stilwell s ability to transfer assets  merge  incur debt  create liens and enter into transactions with affiliates 
the credit facilities require the company to maintain specified financial ratios  including maximum leverage  minimum net worth and fixed charge coverage and minimum unencumbered liquidity 
in addition  stilwell must maintain a minimum level of assets under management to ensure full availability of the credit facilities  and reductions in the amount available would occur if assets under management were to fall below specified levels  and further  stilwell would be required to repay portions of amounts borrowed under the credit facilities in excess of the reduced credit availability amount 
stilwell s ability to comply with such provisions may be affected by events beyond its control 
the breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under the credit facilities 
in the event of any such default  lenders party to the credit facilities could elect to declare all amounts borrowed under the credit facilities  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be due and payable 
if any indebtedness under the credit facilities were to be accelerated  stilwell might not have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness in full 
the timing of future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the company s ability to successfully implement its business strategy 
stilwell may require additional capital sooner than anticipated to the extent that operations do not progress as anticipated 
to the extent credit facilities and operating cash flows are not sufficient to fund stilwell s cash requirements  stilwell would have to seek additional capital that may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if additional capital were not available  stilwell would have to sell some of its assets that could include a portion of the approximate interest in dst 
see part ii item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital structure  of this form k 
stilwell s business is subject to pervasive regulation with attendant costs of compliance and serious consequences for violations 
virtually all aspects of stilwell s business are subject to various laws and regulations 
violations of such laws or regulations could subject stilwell  its subsidiaries and or employees to disciplinary proceedings or civil or criminal liability  including revocation of licenses  censures  fines or temporary suspension or permanent bar from the conduct of business 
any such proceeding or liability could have a material adverse effect upon stilwell s business  financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
these laws and regulations generally grant regulatory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers  including  in some cases  the power to limit or restrict the company from operating in the event of failure to comply with such laws and regulations 
due to the extensive regulations and laws to which stilwell and its subsidiaries are subject  management is required to devote substantial time and effort to legal and regulatory compliance issues 
in addition  the regulatory environment in which stilwell and its subsidiaries operate is subject to change 
stilwell may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations 
see part ii item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  other items regulatory influence  of this form k 
stilwell s business is vulnerable to failures in support systems and customer service functions that could lead to loss of customers or claims against stilwell 
the ability to consistently and reliably obtain securities pricing information  process shareowner transactions and provide reports and other customer service to the shareowners of funds managed by janus  berger and nelson and to the customers of dst is essential to stilwell s continuing success 
any delays or inaccuracies in obtaining pricing information  processing shareowner transactions or providing reports  and any inadequacies in other customer service  could alienate customers and potentially give rise to claims against janus  berger  nelson or dst 
the customer service capability of janus  berger  nelson and dst  as well as their ability to obtain prompt and accurate securities pricing information and to process shareowner transactions and reports  are highly dependent on communications and information systems and on third party vendors 
these systems could suffer failures or interruptions due to various natural or man made causes  and the back up procedures and capabilities may not be adequate to avoid extended interruptions in operations 
furthermore  in response to slowing customer demand  janus reduced its customer support staff by more than  employees during these reductions will cause janus to place greater reliance on its automated customer service systems  thereby increasing the related risks if such systems were to fail 
certain agreements provide the chief executive officer of janus substantial influence over janus 
mr 
bailey has substantial influence over janus  stilwell s most significant subsidiary  and his interest may conflict with stilwell s interests and the interests of stilwell s investors 
the janus stock purchase agreement provides that until april  march  until recent extension  mr 
bailey shall continue to establish and implement policy with respect to the investment advisory and portfolio management activity of janus 
in furtherance of such objective  such agreement provides that  until april  stilwell will vote its shares of janus common stock to elect directors of janus  at least the majority of whom are selected by mr 
bailey  subject to stilwell s approval  which approval may not be unreasonably withheld  and any change in management philosophy  style or approach with respect to investment advisory and portfolio management policies of janus shall be mutually agreed upon by stilwell and mr 
bailey 
after stilwell s purchase of mr 
bailey s shares of janus common stock during  stilwell and janus extended mr 
bailey s management rights through april  after that date  mr 
bailey s rights as described under the janus stock purchase agreement will expire 
however  stilwell expects that mr 
bailey will continue to serve as a director and chief executive officer of janus subsequent to the termination of his management rights  and  as such  mr 
bailey may continue to have substantial influence over janus 
stilwell s business is dependent on investment advisory agreements that are subject to termination or non renewal 
most of the revenues of janus and berger are derived pursuant to investment advisory agreements with their respectively managed mutual funds and other separate and private accounts 
any termination of or failure to renew a significant number of these agreements could have a material adverse impact on the revenues  profits and business of janus or berger 
with respect to agreements with mutual funds  these investment advisory agreements may be terminated by either party with notice  or terminated in the event of an assignment as defined in the investment company act of  and must be approved and renewed annually by the disinterested members of each fund s board of directors or trustees  or its shareowners  as required by law 
in addition  the board of trustees or directors of certain funds and separate and private accounts of janus and berger generally may terminate these investment advisory agreements upon written notice for any reason 
stilwell s business is subject to international market risks that could have a material adverse effect on stilwell s business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain portions of the managed portfolios of janus and berger as well as assets managed by nelson are invested from time to time in various securities of corporations located or doing business in foreign trading markets and developing regions of the world commonly known as emerging markets 
stilwell believes that in the future  investments in international markets will become a larger percentage of assets under management by its subsidiaries 
these portfolios and assets  and revenues derived from the management of such portfolios and assets  are subject to various risks that could have a material adverse effect on stilwell s business  financial condition and results of operations 
such risks include unfavorable political and diplomatic developments  currency fluctuations  social instability and changes in governmental policies  expropriation  nationalization  confiscation of assets and changes in legislation relating to foreign ownership 
in addition  foreign trading markets  particularly in some emerging market countries  are often smaller  less liquid  less regulated and significantly more volatile 
acquisitions  which are part of stilwell s business strategy  involve inherent risks that could result in adverse effects on stilwell s operating results and financial condition and dilute the holdings of current stockholders 
as part of stilwell s business strategy  stilwell intends to consider acquisitions of similar or complementary businesses 
if stilwell were not correct when assessing the value  strengths  weaknesses  liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates or if unsuccessful in integrating the operations of the acquired businesses  stilwell may not achieve the expected return on investment in the acquired businesses  which could have a material adverse effect on stilwell s operating results and financial condition 
any future acquisitions would be accompanied by the risks commonly associated with acquisitions 
these risks include  among others o potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and to acquisition costs and expenses  o the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  o the potential disruption to the business of the combined company and potential diversion of management s time and attention  o the impairment of relationships with and the possible loss of key employees and clients as a result of the changes in management  and o dilution to stockholders if the acquisition were made with the company s common stock 
in addition  the products and technologies of acquired companies may not be effectively assimilated into stilwell s business  and product offerings of the combined company may not have a positive effect on the combined companies revenues or earnings 
the combined company may also incur significant expense to complete the acquisitions and to support the acquired products and businesses 
further  any such acquisitions may be funded with cash  debt or equity or some combination of such consideration  which could have the effect of diluting or otherwise adversely affecting the holdings or the rights of stockholders 
finally  stilwell may not be successful in identifying attractive acquisition candidates or completing acquisitions on favorable terms 
stilwell s inability to access clients through third party distribution channels could have a material adverse effect on stilwell s financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
stilwell s subsidiaries ability to market their mutual funds  subadvisory services and investment services is partly dependent on access to the client base of insurance companies  defined contribution plan administrators  securities firms  brokers  banks and other intermediaries 
these various intermediaries generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to  and in competition with  stilwell and its subsidiaries 
further  the private account business utilizes referrals from financial planners and professional investment advisers  accountants  attorneys and other professionals 
stilwell cannot be certain that it will continue to have access to these third party distribution channels and an inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on stilwell s financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
stilwell s intercompany agreement and tax disaffiliation agreement with kcsi contain indemnification obligations that stilwell may not be able to satisfy  and which may have a material adverse effect on stilwell 
in connection with the spin off of stilwell to kcsi s common stockholders  stilwell entered into an intercompany agreement and a tax disaffiliation agreement with kcsi 
these agreements contain provisions that allocate responsibility between kcsi and stilwell for various liabilities and obligations 
among other things  these agreements provide that each party will indemnify the other against certain claims relating to  or taxes attributable to  their respective businesses before and after the spin off
