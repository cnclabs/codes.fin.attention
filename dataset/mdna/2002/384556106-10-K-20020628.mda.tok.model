sales from the usa operation increased about 
surface condenser sales increased about or about  in fiscal year end fye due to opportunities in the electric power industry 
the power industry includes sales to merchants  cogeneration and independent production facilities 
increased sales in condensers were largely offset by reduced shipments in other product lines 
export shipments  as a percent of total sales  were the lowest they have been since the broad decline in demand for graham s usa products is believed to be temporary 
principal reasons for fewer projects under construction by contractors in the three major segments the company serves refinery  chemical and petrochemical are limited capital spending due to poor global economic conditions  the strong us dollar  merger and acquisition activity  revamping of financial infrastructure needs in asia  and caution resulting from the war on terrorism 
sales from uk operations increased about over fye march  or about  significant sales increases were achieved in the categories of liquid ring pump packages  offshore pumps  dry pumps and spares 
the increased sales in pump packages resulted from the shipment of one large order valued at about  to south africa for the petrochemical industry 
going forward  targeting larger orders will be a strategic objective 
in fye graham purchased leybold s dry pump line 
increased dry pump sales in the current year is due to further establishing the product line under graham s offerings 
this product is predicted to show continued sales growth going forward 
spare part sales increased as a result of the market demand for offshore activity and to the success of the dry pump line 
the consolidated gross profit margin was  down from last year and down from a recent historical range of about 
the uk operations posted a gross profit  up from for the prior year  due to improved product mix 
in the current year the uk operations significantly increased their sales in offshore pumps and spares 
these pumps require high quality standards and special fabrication techniques 
accordingly  they bear a higher profit margin 
in the usa the gross profit percent was  down from in fye march the lower gross profit margin was attributed to depressed selling prices together with greater employment costs in the areas of incentive compensation and medical and workers compensation insurances 
selling  general and administrative expense for the current year was about of sales as compared to about for the prior year 
usa costs approximated fye costs 
the increase occurred in the uk and related to greater costs for additional sales personnel and more sales commissions and royalty payments on higher sales

consolidated sales were up in fye over fye usa operations increased sales by  or 
about  of this increase came from the increase in sales into canada 
this new business is due to mega projects in the synthetic fuel markets 
other export gains over fye were made in asia where orders to oil refinery and petrochemical plants were won and in the middle east where two large orders  one for an oil refinery upgrade and the other an ethylene petrochemical facility  were awarded to graham 
these increases in sales resulted from the timing of when these refining and petrochemical facilities were to be built 
the consolidated gross profit margin was for fye as compared to for fye this is a lower gross profit margin than usual and was a result of several factors including depressed selling prices  rising material costs and overall product mix bearing lower contribution margins than the company s traditional core product margins 
major equipment sales contracts in excess of  increased over the year these orders usually carry a lower contribution percentage and a higher ratio of material costs to sales dollars than non major equipment sales  material content as a percentage of selling price was thus greater than material costs for the prior year 
selling prices were depressed during because the sales opportunities available to sell vacuum and heat transfer equipment were less 
merger and acquisition activity  along with poor economic conditions  depressed capital spending by the process industries 
on average  selling prices were depressed by consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses increased about over fye in the usa graham s costs rose as a result of greater sales commissions due to increased sales and the launching of a comprehensive advertising agenda 
in the uk sg a costs rose 
this increase resulted from gearing up for the future manufacturing and selling of graham s leybold dry pump acquisition eg  staff  sales office in germany 
overall  consolidated sg a expenses were of sales compared to fye when sg a costs equaled of sales

this amount approximates estimated depreciation expense for the upcoming year 
the company plans to fund cash needs through earnings  cash investments  and  if needed  lines of credit 
at march  the usa unused bank line of credit was  the uk operation had an unused line available of compared to consolidated cash flow from operations was negative  in fye compared to negative cash flow of  for the prior year 
the fye shortfall was due to an increase in inventory of or  this buildup was due to scheduled first half fye shipments  billings minus related cost of goods sold on seven percent of completion jobs net of progress payments  the newly acquired dry pump product line  rising raw material costs  and buying ahead to protect from raw material price escalations on fixed price contracts having extended shipment dates 
orders and backlog orders in thousands of dollars usa    uk    eliminations    consolidated    backlog in thousands of dollars usa    uk    eliminations consolidated    graham s consolidated backlog at march  is  this amount represents an increase of about or  greater than at march  included in the backlog is  of orders for electric power plant business that has been put on hold by the customer 
possible release to commence construction could be received in fye  although notices have not been received to date 
all suspended orders are protected with cancellation charges 
the backlog  except for suspended electric power plant orders  is expected to be converted into sales in fye march  orders increased over fye major active industries were power fossil and petroleum refining 
going forward graham expects the power fossil market to continue for an extended period of time  but at a slower pace than orders were received in the past year 
the company believes activity will continue to provide excellent opportunities for new business in the coming year and beyond in the petroleum refinery industry 
this work will be largely related to upgrades required to meet clean air emission standards as well as upgrading facilities for processing lower cost crude oils 
additionally  early signs of a pick up in petrochemical expansions and enhancements  and in particular china  are beginning to surface 
in all markets served  pricing will continue to be competitive in fye market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from changes in market rates and prices to which graham is exposed are interest rates foreign exchange rates equity price risk the assumptions applied in preparing quantitative disclosures regarding interest rate  foreign exchange rate and equity price risk are based upon volatility ranges experienced in relevant historical periods  management s current knowledge of the business and market place  and management s judgment of the probability of future volatility based upon the historical trends and economic conditions of the business 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
management s strategy for managing risks associated with interest rate fluctuations is to hold interest bearing debt to the absolute minimum and carefully assess the risks and rewards for incurring long term debt 
assuming year ended and variable rate debt  a change in interest rates would impact annual interest expense by  and  respectively 
graham s international consolidated sales exposure for the current year approximated of annual sales as compared to for the year operating in world markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates 
currency movements can affect sales in several ways  the foremost being the ability to competitively compete for orders against competition having a relatively weaker currency 
business lost due to this cannot be quantified 
secondly  cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales in foreign currency to us dollars 
the substantial portion of graham s sales is collected in the local currencies 
in and  sales in foreign currencies were and  respectively 
at certain times  the company may enter into forward foreign exchange agreements to hedge its exposure against unfavorable changes in foreign currency values on significant sales contracts negotiated in foreign currencies 
graham has limited exposure to foreign currency purchases 
in fye and  purchases in foreign currencies were and of cost of goods sold  respectively 
at certain times  forward foreign exchange contracts may be utilized to limit currency exposure 
foreign operations resulted in a current year net income of  as compared to  for fye as currency exchange rates change  translations of the income statements of the uk business into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
we do not hedge translation risks because cash flows from uk operations are mostly reinvested in the uk 
a change in foreign exchange rates would have impacted the uk reported net income by approximately  for fye and  for the previous year 
the company has a long term incentive plan which provides for awards of share equivalent units seu for outside directors based upon the company s performance 
the outstanding seu s are recorded at fair market value thereby exposing the company to equity price risk 
gains and losses recognized due to market price changes are included in the quarterly results of operations 
based upon the seu s outstanding at march  and and a per share price  a change in the respective year end market price of the company s common stock would positively or negatively impact the company s operating results by  to  for fye and  to  in fye assuming required net income is met  and based upon a market price of the company s stock of per share  a change in the stock price would positively or negatively impact the company s operating results by  to  in   to  in  and  to  in and thereafter 
other matters increases in material and labor costs traditionally have been offset by cost cutting measures and selling price increases 
obtaining price increases are largely a factor of supply and demand for graham s products  whereas inflation factors can originate from influences outside of the company s direct global competition 
graham will continue to monitor the impact of inflation in order to minimize its effects in future years through sales growth  pricing  product mix strategies  purchasing advantageously  productivity improvements  and cost reductions 
the company s usa operations are governed by federal environmental laws  principally the resource conservation and recovery act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  the clean air act  and the clean water act  as well as state counterparts environmental laws 
environmental laws require that certain parties fund remedial actions regardless of fault  legality or original disposal or ownership of the site 
graham is not involved in any environmental remediation projects 
critical accounting policies the significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses the most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the financial condition and results  and that require judgment 
revenue recognition percentage of completion the company recognizes revenue and all related costs on contracts with a duration in excess of three months and with revenues of  and greater using the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion is determined by relating actual labor incurred to date to management s estimate of total labor to be incurred on each contract 
contracts in progress are reviewed monthly  and sales and earnings are adjusted in current accounting periods based on revisions in contract value and estimated costs at completion 
completed contract contracts with values less than  are accounted for on the completed contract method 
the company recognizes revenue and all related costs on these contracts upon substantial completion or shipment to the customer 
substantial completion is consistently defined as at least complete with regard to direct labor hours 
customer acceptance is generally required throughout the construction process and the company has no further obligations under the contract after the revenue is recognized 
use of estimates we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and reported amounts of revenue and expenses in preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
new accounting pronouncements in fye march  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

 business combinations  and  goodwill and other intangible assets in june neither of these pronouncements will have an impact on graham s financial statements for the year ended march in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets

addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets to be held and used  to be disposed of other than by sale and to be disposed of by sale 
although the statement retains certain of the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it supercedes sfas no 
the statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and therefore  will be adopted by the company  as required  on april  the adoption of sfas no
