critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
this requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and notes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and use historical experience factors and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a list of the accounting policies that we believe reflect our more significant judgments and estimates  and that could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
revenue for manufacturing operations is generally recorded when all of the following conditions have been met an order for a product has been received from a dealer 
written or verbal approval for payment has been received from the dealer s flooring institution 
a common carrier signs the delivery ticket accepting responsibility for the product as agent for the dealer 
product is removed from fleetwood s property for delivery to the dealer who placed the order 
most manufacturing sales are made for cash  with most dealers financing their purchases under flooring arrangements with banks or finance companies 
products are not sold on consignment  dealers do not have the right to return products  and dealers are typically responsible for interest costs to floor plan lenders 
on average  we receive payments from floor plan lenders on products sold to independent dealers within days of the invoice date  which is the date product is shipped 
to adopt the provisions of sab  in fiscal we changed our retail housing revenue recognition policy 
for retail sales from company owned retail stores  sales revenue is recognized when the home has been delivered  set up and accepted by the consumer  title has been transferred and funds have been received either from the finance company or the homebuyer 
prior to fiscal  we followed the industry practice of recording credit retail sales when a written contract and down payment were secured 
we recorded the cumulative effect of this accounting change on the amount of retained earnings at the beginning of fiscal year as a charge against net income in the first quarter of fiscal the after tax amount of the cumulative effect was million  or cents per diluted share 
warranty fleetwood provides customers of our products with a warranty covering defects in material or workmanship for periods ranging from one to two years  with longer warranties on certain structural components 
we record a liability based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
factors we use in estimating the warranty liability include a history of units sold to customers  the average cost incurred to repair a unit and a profile of the distribution of warranty expenditures over the warranty period 
a significant increase in dealer shop rates  the cost of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
insurance reserves generally  we are self insured for workers compensation and products liability and personal injury insurance 
under these plans  liabilities are recognized for claims incurred  including those incurred but not recorded  changes in the reserves related to prior claims and an administration fee 
at the time a claim is filed  a liability is estimated to settle the claim 
the liability for workers compensation claims is determined by state statute 
factors considered in establishing the estimated liability for products liability and personal injury claims are the nature of the claim  the geographical region in which the claim originated  loss history  severity of the claim  the professional judgment of our legal counsel  and inflation 
any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims 
long lived assets we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
any material change affecting the assumptions used to project the estimated undiscounted cash flows or our expectation of future market conditions could result in a different conclusion 
assets for which the carrying value is not fully recoverable are reduced to fair value 
deferred taxes we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we determine that we will not realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we will make an adjustment to the deferred tax assets  which will be charged to income tax expense in the period of such determination 
legal proceedings we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings primarily involving our products or former employees 
because of the uncertainties related to the outcome of the litigation and range of loss on cases other than breach of warranty  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
in other cases  including products liability discussed above and personal injury cases  we prepare estimates based on historical experience  the professional judgment of our legal counsel  and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions and any actual liability that greatly exceeds our estimates could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
repurchase commitments producers of recreational vehicles and manufactured housing customarily enter into repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to independent dealers 
these agreements generally provide that  in the event of a default by a dealer in its obligation to these credit sources  we will repurchase product at declining prices over the term of the agreements  typically over to months 
we then resell any repurchased product through our dealer network 
we estimate our exposure under these agreements based on the financial strength of our dealers  the amount of inventory covered by the agreement  and our ability to resell the repurchased product 
in addition  we have also considered the impact of the recent announcement by a major manufactured housing wholesale floor plan lender that it is exiting the floor plan business and calling for an early termination or workout of its remaining accounts with retailers  including many with whom we do business 
business outlook late in calendar year  the wholesale motor home market  particularly for gasoline powered class a products  began to improve after about months of decline 
the combination of the improved market and positive acceptance of our new products has been reflected in increased market share  higher backlogs and improved production rates  as well as the motor home division s best quarterly results  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  in over two years 
in addition  travel trailers  which began showing some weakness in the third quarter of fiscal year  also demonstrated improvement in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the previous four quarters 
both the towable and motor home segments introduced lower priced products in fiscal year  which adversely affected gross margins 
in addition  we incurred significant non recurring costs in an effort to right size our businesses 
our existing manufacturing capacity is more than adequate to satisfy current retail demand 
with the current low interest rates  declining dealer inventories  significant restructuring costs mostly behind us  and the introduction of new products  we expect our recreational vehicle group will achieve improved operating results in fiscal over fiscal however  the improved results of our recreational vehicle group could be adversely affected if recent declines in the stock market begin to undermine consumer confidence  which is a key factor affecting the recreational vehicle industry 
conditions in the manufactured housing market have been in decline for the past three fiscal years  but further deteriorated in the last quarter of fiscal excess retail locations and inventory  competition from repossessed homes  more stringent lending standards and relatively high interest rates have adversely affected the industry 
these conditions were aggravated by several developments early in calendar as a result of the exit of several consumer lenders  there has been a reduction in the volume of loans being written  particularly in the chattel home only portion of the business 
further  new legislation in texas  the largest manufactured home market in the country  requires many of the procedures and legal processes employed in the sale of conventional housing to be applied to sales of manufactured homes  resulting in lost or delayed sales 
finally  conseco  the largest floor plan lender in the country  announced its withdrawal from that business 
although industry manufacturing and retail capacities have been reduced  weak market conditions are expected to continue until the inventory imbalance is fully resolved 
to a large degree  the length of the inventory adjustment period will depend on retail financing conditions 
the operating environment in fiscal year for manufactured housing will continue to be challenging 
results in the fourth quarter of fiscal were adversely affected by the continuing weakness in the market caused by the lack of financing and it is expected that this trend will continue into the first quarter of fiscal year in recognition of the challenges ahead in housing  in the fourth quarter we recorded substantial charges to recognize the reduced value of aged retail inventory and to reserve for costs related to closed stores 
these charges adversely impacted our results for the quarter and for the year 
in fiscal year  we anticipate that we will continue to incur operating losses at our manufactured housing retail subsidiary  although we expect to achieve profitability in the manufacturing segment of both the housing and recreational vehicle groups 
goodwill impairment as previously announced  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
as of the first quarter in fiscal year this new accounting standard requires that goodwill not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment and expensed against earnings when the implied fair value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  is less than its carrying amount 
we had two reporting units with goodwill  folding trailers and retail housing 
based on the estimated fair value  as determined from the first phase assessment for each reporting unit  folding trailers estimated fair value exceeded its carrying amount including goodwill resulting in no impairment  and retail housing s estimated fair value was less than its carrying amount 
the second phase of the assessment was conducted only for retail housing since the first phase assessment indicated there was impairment 
based on the estimated fair value and appraisal of fixed assets at retail housing  the remaining million of goodwill was determined to be fully impaired 
since the goodwill impairment was the result of an accounting change that was effective with the first quarter  the million charge is not reflected in the fourth quarter results 
however  it appears as a line item on the income statement for the fiscal year described as cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax 
in fiscal we incurred a similar non cash charge related to the impairment of goodwill in the amount of million  which was included in operating income 
the manufactured housing business more than doubled between and from  industry shipments in calendar to  units in calendar year this growth was fueled by low interest rates  high consumer confidence  low unemployment  improved products and expansion of consumer lending 
the increased business attracted additional retailers with a corresponding increase in retailer inventories and lower consumer credit standards 
due to the strength of the market  retailers  including some of fleetwood s largest and financially strongest  were offered large premiums by financial consolidators and other manufacturers to sell their businesses 
to protect our distribution channel  we found it necessary to enter the manufactured housing retail business 
we began in august with the acquisition of the nation s largest independent retailer 
we made several other acquisitions of independent retailers and also commenced developing a number of our own greenfield locations 
in two years our retail business grew to retail stores and over million in revenue 
however  the manufactured housing market peaked in at  retail units just as we entered the retail segment 
the combination of a declining market  too many retailers  too much inventory  and the consequences of loose credit standards through  caused the inflated retail market to fall to  units in to adjust to the shrinking market  we reduced the number of stores by over to  consolidated operations and reduced the head count of our retail operations by over percent 
the industry still has excess capacity  is competing with a projected  repossessed units that are being sold at deep discounts  and is faced with a very restrictive financing environment 
in addition to relatively high interest rates for the products  credit standards have tightened and several large retail lenders have exited the business 
the remaining lenders are projecting significant reductions in their loan originations for the calendar year 
in light of these developments  it is apparent that revenues of the retail business have fallen short of the cash flows that were originally projected 
in fiscal  we recorded a goodwill impairment of million based on an evaluation performed under the guidelines of fas no 
the evaluation of the retail business s fair value in fiscal year  using fas no 
guidelines  was conducted with the assistance of a prominent independent appraisal company  resulting in the impairment of the remaining million of goodwill 
consolidated results fiscal year compared with fiscal year we incurred a net loss in fiscal of million or per diluted share 
a substantial portion of the loss  million  was attributable to a non cash charge for impairment of goodwill and million to other restructuring and impairment charges 
this compares with a loss of million or per diluted share for fiscal  which included other non operating charges of million for the impairment of goodwill and million for restructuring and asset impairment 
cash provided from operations on a per share basis was per share in fiscal compared to cents per share in the prior year 
in addition to the goodwill and other impairments  the current year loss also stems from significantly reduced sales volume in both the manufacturing and retail operations of the manufactured housing group 
these declines are primarily the result of competitive market conditions caused by a restrictive financing environment and competition for sales of new homes with repossessed units  which have negatively impacted the manufactured housing industry for the past three years 
over the past two years we have been rightsizing our operations  resulting in significant restructuring and other unusual charges that have negatively impacted our results 
a summary is provided below to illustrate the type of adjustments  the business segments affected and the magnitude of the adjustments 
generally  warranty reserve adjustments and inventory write downs related to closed facilities are not considered restructuring

consolidated revenues for the fiscal year were billion  down percent from the prior year s billion 
the decline was primarily due to continued weakness in the demand for manufactured housing 
housing revenues for the fiscal year were billion  down percent from the prior year 
gross revenues for the manufacturing segment of housing fell by percent to million  including intercompany sales of million 
retail revenues were down by percent to million  which approximates the percentage decrease in the number of retail stores 
stronger recreational vehicle demand in the second half of the year pushed recreational vehicle revenues to billion  the same as the prior year 
gross profit margin in the current year increased to percent of sales from percent a year ago  reflecting improved manufacturing margins 
manufacturing gross margin rose from percent of sales in fiscal to percent for the current year mainly due to improved housing and motor home margins 
reduced retail housing margins reflect very competitive market conditions and declining industry sales  as well as a million write down of aged and distressed inventory to net realizable value this year 
operating expenses  excluding other charges  declined million or percent to million 
as a percentage of sales  these costs declined from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal due to continued downsizing activities 
selling expenses declined percent to million  but rose as a percentage of sales from percent to percent on the lower sales volume 
most of the dollar reduction in selling costs resulted from reduced expenditures for advertising  point of purchase materials  shows  sales commissions and sales compensation 
the bulk of these cost reductions occurred within the recreational vehicle segment  and can be attributed not only to volume  but enhanced cost controls 
selling expenses were lower this year  but as a percentage of sales they were higher in the current year due to increased warranty and service costs 
general and administrative expenses declined percent to million  and declined as a percentage of sales from percent to percent 
most of the reduction in general and administrative costs stems from downsizing in the second half of fiscal  lower profit based incentive compensation and lower staffing levels 
non operating expenses of million were percent higher than last year s million  mainly due to lower interest expense and lower investment income 
interest expense was lower due to reduced borrowings 
investment income was down percent from the prior year as a result of lower interest rates and reduced invested balances 
our effective income tax rate increased from percent in fiscal to percent in the current year 
the sharp increase primarily reflects the impact of the higher charge for the impairment of goodwill in fiscal year  which  for the most part  is not deductible for tax purposes 
manufactured housing gross manufacturing revenues of million were off percent from the prior year  and included million of intercompany sales to company owned retail home centers 
manufacturing unit volume declined percent to  homes  but the number of sections was off a lesser percent to  due to the continuing shift in sales mix toward multi section homes 
multi section homes represented percent of our factory sales versus percent in the prior year 
the lower housing volume reflects a weak manufactured housing market that has further deteriorated over the past year 
during the past three years  the industry has been adversely affected by excessive retail inventories and restrictive retail financing conditions 
lenders have imposed more stringent credit standards  higher down payment requirements for retail buyers and have taken higher spreads between their cost of funds and retail financing rates 
additionally  several consumer lenders have withdrawn from the business  which has limited the amount of funding available to the industry 
these actions  combined with relatively higher interest rates charged to manufactured housing customers  have eliminated many potential buyers from the market 
we anticipate that industry wholesale shipments will continue to be weak until the current inventory imbalance is resolved  the timing of which depends largely on improved availability and terms of retail financing 
housing operating income  before the adjustment for intercompany manufacturing profit  declined percent from million to million  and operating margin fell from percent to percent of sales 
the operating income decline is greater if the million of restructuring and impairment charges related to plant closings and downsizing initiatives are added back to fiscal operating income and the million of asset impairment charges are added back to the current year income 
excluding the other charges  the adjusted fiscal operating income is million and fiscal year income is million for a percent drop 
gross profit margin for the manufactured housing group improved slightly from percent to percent of sales as a result of lower raw material costs 
more efficient material usage and improved product pricing contributed to the higher gross margin percentage 
manufactured housing group operating costs  excluding the other charges  would have been the same as the prior year  despite the sales decline  mainly as a result of higher product warranty and service costs 
the increase in warranty and service costs was due to increased reserves for closed facilities and costs related to new regional service centers 
these higher costs effectively offset the positive impact of lower general and administrative costs due to staffing reductions resulting from downsizing efforts

all other statistics in this report regarding frc are as of fleetwood enterprises  inc s fiscal year end  which is the last sunday in april of each year 
retail housing operations revenues for retail housing declined by million or percent to million in fiscal the decline is due to the significant decrease in the number of retail stores during the year 
it also is due to lower sales volume as a result of the restrictive retail financing environment 
unit sales from fleetwood retail stores fell percent to  homes 
as a result of a change in accounting for retail credit sales  we incurred a one time cumulative charge against earnings of million after taxes in fiscal year we had retail stores in operation at fiscal year end compared to one year earlier 
the retail division incurred an operating loss of million compared to a loss of million a year ago 
the current year loss includes restructuring charges totaling million related to downsizing initiatives 
earnings were also adversely affected by a million inventory write down 
excluding these unusual charges  the operating loss in the current year was due to the weak market environment and lower gross margins stemming from extremely competitive market conditions 
operating expenses  excluding restructuring and impairment charges  decreased million or percent due to reducing the number of retail stores by percent and consolidating operations 
interest expense on inventory financing decreased from million to million due to lower interest rates and a million reduction in our retail flooring liability 
recreational vehicles in fiscal year  recreational vehicle sales were flat with the prior year at billion 
motor home revenues increased by percent to million on a percent increase in shipments from  units to  units 
this mainly reflects improved retail demand and motor home dealer confidence beginning late in calendar year in the towable recreational vehicle category  travel trailer sales declined percent from million to million as we continued to suffer from a lukewarm response to new product offerings in this segment 
folding trailer sales rose one percent to million 
fiscal year unit shipments for travel trailers and folding trailers were  including slide in truck campers and  respectively  representing a decrease of percent for travel trailers and percent for folding trailers 
the rv group incurred a million operating loss for the year compared with a million loss in fiscal year the operating loss was due to travel trailers losing million on the decline in sales and low gross margins 
motor homes earned  compared to a loss of million in the prior year 
the significant improvement in earnings was the result of a percent increase in sales  improved gross margins and reduced operating expenses 
folding trailers earned  compared to million in the prior year 
last year s rv group results were negatively impacted by high sales incentives  labor inefficiencies due to erratic production schedules  and plant shutdown costs 
gross profit margin for the rv group increased from percent to percent due to improvement in motor home margins 
motor home gross margin improvement was primarily due to a shift in product mix from class c product to higher priced class a motor homes 
rv group operating costs were percent lower than the prior year on flat sales mainly due to the prior year s downsizing activities 
supply operations the company s supply group contributed revenues of million compared to million in the prior year 
operating income increased percent to million mainly due to improved labor efficiencies from increased capacity utilization gained mainly through increased internal sales to motor home plants 
current quarter compared to same quarter last year consolidated results we incurred a net loss in the fourth quarter of million compared to million in the prior year 
the current quarter included million of incremental restructuring and asset impairment charges related in part to prior year downsizing at retail housing and asset impairments on four previously closed manufacturing facilities 
in the fourth quarter of the prior year we recorded million of restructuring and asset impairment charges  which were related to the closure of two motor home plants and the consolidation of retail operations 
the loss in the current period primarily resulted from a percent decline in retail housing sales coupled with a lower gross margin for the combined housing business 
consolidated revenues rose percent to million compared to million in the prior year s fourth quarter 
recreational vehicle sales increased percent to million  primarily due to a percent surge in motor home sales 
manufactured housing s gross sales including intercompany decreased from million in the prior year to million 
housing retail sales continued to decline  dropping percent from the prior year  reflecting a restrictive financing environment and prompting a further reduction in the number of company operated retail stores 
gross profit margin declined from percent of sales last year to percent in the current quarter due to inventory write downs at retail housing for aged and distressed inventory  and lower margins in the manufactured housing operations due to price competition  including competition with sellers of repossessed homes  in the current industry environment 
operating expenses  excluding the restructuring and asset impairment charges  decreased million or percent to million 
as a percentage of sales  these costs declined from percent to percent due to consolidation of operations and cost reduction actions taken over the past year 
selling expenses for the current quarter were up percent to million  and rose as a percentage of sales from percent to percent of sales 
decreases in advertising and marketing expenses were more than offset by increases in warranty and service costs due in part to opening new service centers and parts warehouses as well as increased warranty reserves related mostly to closed plants 
general and administrative expenses fell million or percent to million  and decreased as a percentage of sales from percent to percent 
the dollar reduction primarily reflects lower employee compensation and benefits  mainly as the result of downsizing  and the reclassification of sales and service salaries to selling expense 
non operating expenses decreased from million to million for the current year mainly due to lower interest expense from lower rates on reduced borrowings 
manufactured housing gross manufacturing revenues of million decreased percent from the prior year  and included million of intercompany sales to company owned retail home centers 
manufacturing unit volume declined percent to  homes and the number of sections decreased percent to  multi section homes represented percent of factory sales  which was the same as the prior year 
the decline in housing volume reflects the continuation of a three year weakness in the manufactured housing market largely due to restrictive retail financing conditions 
the market started to improve late in calendar year but was then further negatively impacted in the first calendar quarter of by major lenders announcing they were exiting the retail lending business in two cases and in the other case floor plan lending 
in january  the third largest consumer lender  greenpoint exited the business 
further  conseco  the largest originator of floor plan financing for manufactured housing dealers  announced its exit from that business 
these actions  combined with higher interest rates and stringent loan terms  such as shorter maturities relative to site built housing  have discouraged or eliminated many potential buyers of manufactured homes 
we anticipate that industry wholesale shipments will continue to be weak until the current inventory imbalance is resolved  the timing of which depends largely on an improvement in the availability and terms of retail financing for our customers 
housing operations  excluding the adjustment for intercompany inventory profit  incurred a million loss in the fourth quarter compared to earning million in the prior year 
the current year loss was mostly due to a reduction in gross margin and an increase in product warranty and service costs 
gross profit margin for the housing group decreased from percent to percent of sales as a result of price competition generally and also a more competitive product mix of units containing additional features at lower margins 
housing group operating costs rose percent  due mainly to increased warranty and service costs  which resulted from the new regional service operations and increased warranty reserves related to closed plants 
retail housing operations fourth quarter revenues for the retail housing business dropped percent to million and unit sales declined percent to  homes  due to reduced demand as a result of the financing environment  and also a sharply reduced number of stores 
the retail division incurred an operating loss of million for the current quarter compared to a loss of million a year ago 
included in the current year loss was million for restructuring and impairment charges related to writing off leasehold improvements and reserving for future lease costs at closed stores  plus additional asset impairment charges that exceeded prior year reserves 
last year  the significant operating loss included million of impairment charges related to downsizing 
the operating loss this year was the result of a decline in sales brought about by restrictive financing conditions and exacerbated by million of inventory write downs of aged and distressed inventory 
operating expenses  excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges of million in and million in  declined percent due to lower volume  store closures and reduced staffing 
interest expense on inventory financing decreased by percent from million to  reflecting a million or percent drop in inventory and lower interest rates 
the retail housing segment was operating stores at the end of april compared to at the end of april a year ago 
recreational vehicles recreational vehicle sales increased percent to million compared to million in the prior year s fourth quarter 
sales for all three segments increased  led by a percent jump in motor home revenues to million on a percent increase in unit shipments to  the primary impetus for the increased sales revenue was the strong acceptance by dealers and customers of the recently refreshed pace arrow and southwind brands and three new diesel products 
in the towable recreational vehicle categories  travel trailer sales rose percent to million and folding trailer sales increased percent to million 
fourth quarter unit shipments for travel trailers and folding trailers were  and  respectively  representing increases of percent and percent 
the rv group essentially broke even in the fourth quarter compared to a loss from operations of million in the prior year  mainly as a result of the improvement in motor home sales and gross margins 
motor home plants earned million compared to a loss from operations of million in the prior year 
gross profit margin in the rv group rose from percent a year ago to percent of sales  largely reflecting the closure of two motor home plants in the prior year  combined with a product mix shift to more profitable units 
in addition  last year s travel trailer gross margins were negatively impacted by a sharp decline in volume  production shutdowns  material obsolescence and higher wage and benefit costs resulting from production inefficiencies at lower volume levels 
operating costs for our rv group  excluding asset impairment charges of million from the current quarter and restructuring charges of million from the prior year  were percent lower than the prior year due to successful downsizing initiatives carried out since last year 
supply operations the supply group contributed fourth quarter revenues of million compared to million a year ago 
operating income tripled from million to million for the current year  primarily due to increased sales volume and improved gross margin related to a shift in products 
consolidated results fiscal year compared to fiscal year we incurred a net loss in fiscal of million or per diluted share  the majority of which was attributable to non recurring charges related to goodwill impairment  restructuring and downsizing initiatives 
this compares with a profit of million or per diluted share for fiscal the loss also stems from significantly reduced sales volume in both manufactured housing and recreational vehicles caused by a weak market environment 
a change in accounting for credit retail housing sales  which was adopted in the first quarter  also contributed to the loss 
in terms of earnings per share  the impairment to goodwill and other non recurring charges and the cumulative effect of the change in accounting amounted to approximately and cents  respectively 
we incurred a million non cash charge related to the impairment of goodwill that originated with acquisitions of retail housing businesses in prior years 
in addition  we recorded other charges totaling million  which were related to the downsizing of manufactured housing  recreational vehicle and retail housing operations 
the latter category included million for asset impairment charges related to downsizing of the retail housing business and million for the write down of manufacturing facilities  as well as employee severance payments and other plant closing costs 
consolidated revenues fell percent to billion compared to billion in the prior fiscal year 
the prior year s period included weeks compared to weeks in fiscal the revenue decline reflects continued market weakness in the demand for both recreational vehicles and manufactured housing 
gross profit margin in fiscal declined to percent of sales from percent a year prior  reflecting lower manufacturing and retail margins 
manufacturing gross margin fell to percent of sales compared to fiscal s percent margin 
lower recreational vehicle gross margins were only partially offset by improved margins from manufactured housing 
gross margins were adversely impacted by higher direct labor wage and benefits and inefficiencies due to lower volume 
reduced retail housing margins reflect very competitive market conditions and declining industry sales  as well as a million writedown of inventory to net realizable value 
operating expenses  excluding other charges  declined million or percent to million 
as a percentage of sales  however  these costs rose from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal due to lower sales 
selling expenses declined percent to million  but rose as a percentage of sales from percent to percent on the lower sales volume 
most of the dollar reduction in selling costs resulted from reduced expenditures for advertising  sales compensation and product warranty and service costs 
the bulk of these cost reductions occurred within the manufactured housing segment 
these reductions can be attributed not only to volume  but enhanced cost controls 
general and administrative expenses declined percent to million  but rose as a percentage of sales from percent to percent 
reduced costs in the manufacturing sector were partially offset by higher expenses for the retail housing business  which was in an expansion mode until midyear 
most of the reduction in general and administrative costs stems from lower profit based incentive compensation and lower staffing levels 
non operating expenses of million were significantly higher than fiscal s million  mainly due to higher interest expense and lower investment income 
interest expense was higher due to additional short term and long term borrowings and higher interest rates 
investment income was down percent from the prior year as a result of reduced invested balances 
the company s effective income tax rate declined from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal the decrease primarily reflects the impact of the impairment of goodwill  which for the most part is not deductible for tax purposes 
manufactured housing gross manufacturing revenues of million were off percent from the prior year  and included million of intercompany sales to company operated retail home centers 
manufacturing unit volume declined percent to  homes  but the number of sections was off a lesser percent to  due to the continuing shift in sales mix toward multi section homes 
multi section homes represented percent of factory sales versus percent in fiscal the lower housing volume reflects a weak manufactured housing market that deteriorated over the year 
during the prior two years  the industry had been adversely affected by excessive retail inventories and restrictive retail financing conditions 
lenders have imposed more stringent credit standards  higher down payment requirements for retail buyers and higher spreads between their cost of funds and retail financing rates 
additionally  several key lenders have reduced their financing budgets  which has limited the amount of funding available to the industry 
these actions compounded with higher interest rates have eliminated many potential buyers of manufactured homes 
housing operating income  before the adjustment for intercompany manufacturing profit  declined percent from million to million  and operating margin fell from percent to percent of sales 
most of the decline was volume related 
about million or percent of the profit decline resulted from restructuring and impairment charges related to plant closings and downsizing initiatives 
excluding these other charges  operating margin for the housing group was percent in the fiscal the other charges included million for the write down of plant facilities  million for employee severance benefits and  of other costs 
gross profit margin for the manufactured housing group improved slightly from percent to percent of sales as a result of lower raw material costs 
more efficient material usage  improved product pricing and lower lumber costs all contributed to the higher gross margin percentage 
manufactured housing group operating costs  excluding the other charges  fell percent  mainly as a result of lower product warranty and service costs  reduced selling expenses and lower employee compensation 
compensation costs reflected lower profit based incentive compensation and staffing reductions resulting from downsizing efforts 
retail housing operations the retail housing division generated revenues of million in fiscal  percent below fiscal unit sales from fleetwood retail stores fell percent to  homes 
as a result of a change in accounting for retail credit sales  the company incurred a one time cumulative charge against earnings of million after taxes 
we had retail stores in operation at fiscal year end compared to one year earlier 
the retail division incurred an operating loss of million compared to a nominal profit of million in fiscal the fiscal loss includes asset impairment charges totaling million related to downsizing initiatives 
earnings were also adversely affected by a million inventory write down  which increased cost of sales and reduced the gross profit margin 
excluding these unusual charges  the larger operating loss in the current year was due to the weaker market environment and lower gross margins stemming from extremely competitive market conditions  along with higher overhead costs related to the expansion of retail locations in the early part of the year 
interest expense on inventory financing increased from million to million due to higher interest rates 
recreational vehicles recreational vehicle sales declined percent to billion in fiscal year compared to billion for the prior fiscal year  primarily as a result of sharply lower motor home sales 
motor home revenues fell percent from billion to million on a percent drop in shipments from  units to  units 
this mainly reflects softening retail demand and high dealer inventories at the beginning of the year 
sales were also weaker for towable recreational vehicle products 
in the towable recreational vehicle categories  travel trailer sales declined percent from million to million and folding trailer sales eased percent from million to million 
fiscal year unit shipments for travel trailers and folding trailers were  and  respectively  representing decreases of percent and percent 
the rv group incurred a million operating loss for the year  mainly as a result of the significant decline in sales and slimmer gross margins 
other significant factors that influenced results included inefficiencies from lower production levels  inventory writedowns  increased dealer incentives implemented to stimulate sales and higher than normal operating costs for the motor home division 
also  the rv group incurred other costs related to a plant closing and other downsizing initiatives  which totaled million 
gross profit margin declined sharply to percent of sales from percent in fiscal  largely due to lower motor home and travel trailer margins 
both motor homes and travel trailers experienced higher raw material and direct labor costs  which reflect unfavorable product mix changes  higher wage and benefit costs and production inefficiencies at lower volume levels 
rv group operating costs were percent lower than the prior year mainly due to reduced selling expenses related to the decline in volume 
general and administrative expenses for the rv group were percent below fiscal  mainly due to staffing reductions and lower levels of profit based management incentive compensation 
supply operations the company s supply group contributed revenues of million compared to million in the prior year 
operating income fell percent to million mainly due to reduced sales volume  which was adversely affected by lower internal sales and declining external sales to the heavy truck building industry 
liquidity and capital resources operations we have historically relied upon internally generated cash flows to satisfy working capital needs and to fund capital expenditures 
in recent periods  however  we have used external funding sources to supplement internal cash flows see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
despite the significant losses over the past two years  cash provided by operating activities totaled million in fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
the increased cash flow from operations in fiscal resulted largely from a million reduction in inventories  primarily in the retail housing segment 
also contributing to the positive cash flow was a million refund of federal taxes paid in prior periods  an increase of million in accounts payable and a million increase in other liabilities 
in addition  on october   the board of directors discontinued the payment of dividends on our common stock and elected to defer the distributions on our convertible trust preferred securities 
also  the february distribution on both series of our convertible trust preferred securities was paid with shares of our common stock in lieu of cash 
these actions preserved million of cash for this fiscal year 
cash and marketable investments increased from million as of april   to million at the end of april the higher level of cash and marketable investments was largely the result of net proceeds of million from the sale and exchange of new convertible trust preferred securities  million net proceeds from the sale of common stock to a private investment fund and million of borrowings on the secured credit facility  as well as higher cash flow from operations as discussed above 
the increase in cash and marketable investments was reduced by the payoff of million of unsecured notes due to the prudential insurance company of america  a reduction in retail inventory financing of million  and the retirement of the million balance due on motor home chassis financing 
additional cash outlays in the current year included million for capital expenditures  million for distributions on the convertible trust preferred securities made prior to the deferral of distributions  and million in dividends to shareholders made prior to october 
last year distributions on the convertible trust preferred securities totaled million  dividends were million and net capital expenditures totaled million 
amendments to the credit agreement on july   we executed an agreement with our loan syndicate to amend our credit agreement  dated as of july  the credit agreement 
one primary purpose of the amendment was to delete the existing free cash flow and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants  and replace them with covenants reflecting the company s current financial position and current market conditions 
these new covenants require us to maintain liquidity  which includes the daily average of cash equivalents and borrowing capacity under the credit facility  of at least  and also to maintain certain cumulative levels of ebitda 
in addition  another covenant was amended to permit us to advance additional funds to our captive finance subsidiary 
in return  the pricing on the facility was restored to the higher level that had been in place prior to february of this year  and we paid a fee of one half of a percent of the amount of the commitment to the syndicate 
in addition  if a fixed charge coverage ratio test is not met at the end of our third quarter in january  we will pay an additional fee of one percent of the amount of the facility 
this test  however  is not a covenant and is applied only for the purpose of determining whether an additional fee is due 
the amount of the commitment is unchanged  at million  although the million property  plant and equipment sub facility that was part of the borrowing base for the revolver has been eliminated and the remaining million balance on the million term loan was paid off and the obligation retired 
the amendments were effective as of our fiscal year on april  convertible trust preferred securities on december   we commenced an offer of up to an aggregate of million in liquidation amount of new convertible trust ii preferred securities due february   in exchange for up to an aggregate of million of the million in liquidation amount of outstanding convertible trust preferred securities due february  the exchange offer expired on january   and was completed on january  each new trust preferred security issued in the exchange offer is convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time into shares of fleetwood common stock ie  a conversion price of per common share 
with million shares of new trust preferred issued in the exchange offer  the potential dilution to common shareholders upon conversion of the new exchange offer trust preferred is million common shares 
as a result of the exchange  debentures supporting the exchanged convertible preferred securities were cancelled  resulting in a taxable gain of million 
after deducting taxes of million  the remainder of million was reported as an increase to additional paid in capital and treated as income attributable to common shareholders in the calculation of earnings per share 
in conjunction with the exchange offer  we offered to sell for cash million of convertible trust iii preferred securities due february  the registration statement was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on december   and the cash offer closed on december  each trust iii preferred security issued in the cash offer is convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time into shares of fleetwood common stock ie  a conversion price of per common share 
with million shares of new trust preferred issued in the cash offer  the potential dilution to common shareholders upon conversion of the new cash offer trust preferred is million common shares 
upon closing  of the million net proceeds received  million was used to pay down the bank term loan to a balance of million and another approximately million was used to pay off the balance then outstanding on the revolving loan 
the remaining proceeds are available for general corporate purposes 
dividends and distributions on october   the board of directors discontinued the payment of dividends on our common stock and elected to defer the distribution on our existing convertible trust preferred securities due to be made on november  the distributions on the remaining trust preferred securities due to be paid on february   and may   were also deferred 
we have the right to elect to defer distributions for up to consecutive quarters under the trust indenture governing the existing trust preferred securities 
when we defer a distribution on the securities  we are prevented from declaring or paying dividends on our common stock during the period of the deferral 
in light of our business environment and recent operating results  we currently anticipate that we will find it necessary to defer distributions on the existing trust preferred securities indefinitely  subject to the terms of the governing documents 
distributions on the new trust preferred securities can be paid in cash or  at our election  prior to february   in our common stock  at a rate of per year of the liquidation amount of per exchange preferred security and per cash offer preferred security 
after february   we can defer interest payments on the new securities for up to consecutive quarterly periods 
as previously announced  we elected to pay the distributions on the new trust preferred securities due to be made on february   and may   in shares of our common stock 
in light of our business environment and recent operating results we currently anticipate that we will find it necessary to do so indefinitely  subject to the terms of the governing documents 
we are in the process of exploring other possible sources of junior capital to replace some of the existing debt 
if we are successful  we believe that these financing sources are likely to be in place sometime during the second fiscal quarter of  although there is no assurance any such junior capital can be obtained  on favorable terms or at all 
in march of  fleetwood entered into a sale and leaseback agreement involving manufactured housing retail stores 
the agreement includes a contingent rental reset provision which provides that  in the event that the company s credit rating falls below a certain level anytime prior to march  the company could be required  at the option of the lessor  to make an accelerated rent payment equal to the unamortized principal of the lessor s underlying debt 
since entering into the agreement  the company s credit rating has fallen below the specified level  raising the possibility that the provision could be exercised 
using current interest rates to approximate it  the accelerated payment  due in march  would be approximately million 
a number of alternatives to the accelerated rent payment are currently available to the company and are being considered 
it is likely that sometime prior to march  the company will move to restructure the arrangement to mitigate the potential negative cash impact 
in the opinion of management  the combination of existing cash resources  expected future cash flows from operations  and available lines of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our foreseeable cash requirements for the next months  including up to million for capital expenditures 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
and no 
 requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
effective with fiscal year  we have adopted sfas no 
and concurrently as permitted by sfas no 
have reclassified the held to maturity investment portfolio to the available for sale category 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and was adopted by the company effective april  the statement requires that goodwill not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment and expensed against earnings when the implied fair value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  is less than its carrying amount 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we were permitted six months from the adoption date to complete a preliminary review of goodwill 
because the preliminary review indicated potential impairment  a second phase of review was commenced to determine the amount of the impairment 
in connection with our preliminary review  we engaged outside consultants to assist with the determination of the estimated fair value for our two reporting units with goodwill 
based on our findings  it was determined the estimated fair value of one of the reporting units  retail housing  was less than its carrying amount including goodwill 
effective with the first quarter of fiscal  we have recognized an impairment charge of million  which represents a complete write off of all remaining goodwill relating to the retail housing division 
in the future  we will evaluate the estimated fair value of the folding trailer reporting unit at the end of each fiscal year and whenever circumstances dictate that a review should be completed 
before considering any potential effects of impairment discussed above  the adoption of the new standard resulted in net loss decreasing by million or cents per share for fiscal year  due to the elimination of goodwill amortization 
comparative pro forma results for the year ended april   would have reduced both the loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and net loss by million or cents per share 
we had million of goodwill remaining on our balance sheet as of fiscal year end and million as of the end of fiscal year in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june   and we do not expect its adoption will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  as it relates to the accounting for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and we do not expect its adoption will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on marketable investments  cash value of company owned life insurance and variable rate debt 
variable rate debt consists of amounts borrowed under the bank line of credit and the liability for flooring of manufactured housing retail inventories 
we do not currently use interest rate swaps  futures contracts or options on futures  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the vast majority of marketable investments are in fixed rate securities with relatively short maturities  minimizing the effect of interest rate fluctuations on their fair value 
the assets underlying the company owned life insurance are recorded at fair market value 
for fixed rate debt and convertible trust preferred securities  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the obligations  but not earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not influence fair market value  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
absent default  we do not have an obligation to prepay any fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and fluctuations in fair market value do not have an impact on such debt except in the unlikely event that we might have a need to refinance it 
holding the variable rate debt balance constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates occurring on the first day of the fiscal year would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately  we do not believe that future market interest rate risks related to current marketable investments or current debt obligations will have a material impact on the company or the results of its future operations
