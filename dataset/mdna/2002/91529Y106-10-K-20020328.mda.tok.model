item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction on june   unum corporation unum merged with and into provident companies  inc provident under the name unumprovident corporation 
the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the historical financial results discussed herein give effect to the merger as if it had been completed at the beginning of the earliest period presented 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein in item the trends in new annualized sales in the employee benefits  individual  and voluntary benefits segments are indicators of the company s potential for growth in its respective markets and the level of market acceptance of price changes and new products 
the company emphasizes integrated selling that combines employee benefit coverages  individual products  and voluntary workplace products 
the company has closely linked its various incentive compensation programs to the achievement of its goals for new sales and persistency 
critical accounting policies reserves for policy and contract benefits the two primary categories of liabilities for policy and contract benefits are policy reserves for claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred and have future benefits to be paid 
policy reserves equal the present value of the difference between future policy benefits and expenses and future premiums  allowing a margin for profit 
these reserves are applicable for the majority of the company s business  which is traditional non interest sensitive in nature 
the claim payments are estimated using assumptions established when the policy was issued 
generally accepted accounting principles require that these assumptions not be subsequently modified unless the policy reserves are determined to be inadequate 
throughout the life of the policy  the reserve is based on the original assumptions used for the policy s issue year 
a claim reserve is established when a claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to the company 
policy reserves for a particular policy continue to be maintained after a claim reserve has been established 
claim reserves generally equal the company s estimate  at the current reporting period  of the present value of the liability for future benefits to be paid on a claim 
a claim reserve for a specific claim is based on assumptions derived from the company s actual historical experience as to claim duration as well as the specific circumstances of the claimant such as benefits available under the policy  the covered benefit period and the age and occupation of the claimant 
consideration is given to historical trends in the company s experience and to expected deviations from historical experience that result from changes in benefits available  changes in the company s risk management policies and procedures  and other economic  environmental  or societal factors 
reserves for claims that are estimated to have already been incurred but that have not yet been reported to the company are based on factors such as historical claim reporting patterns  the average cost of claims  and the expected volumes of incurred claims 
claim reserves  unlike policy reserves  are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future factors impacting claim experience change 
the company reviews annually  or more frequently as appropriate  emerging experience to ensure that its claim reserves provide the company s current estimate of adequate and reasonable provision for future benefits 
this review includes the determination of a range of reasonable estimates within which the reserve must fall 
deferred policy acquisition costs the company defers certain costs incurred in acquiring new business and amortizes expenses these costs over the life of the related policies 
the company uses its own historical experience and expectation of the future performance of its business in determining the expected life of the policies 
approximately percent of the company s deferred policy acquisition costs relates to traditional non interest sensitive products  for which the costs are amortized in proportion to the estimated premium income to be received over the life of the policies 
the estimated premium income in the early years of the amortization period is higher than in the later years due to anticipated policy lapses  which results in a greater proportion of the costs being amortized in the early years of the life of the policy 
amortization of deferred costs on traditional products is adjusted annually to reflect the actual policy lapse experience as compared to the anticipated experience 
the company will experience increased amortization if policies terminate earlier than projected 
deferred costs related to group and individual disability products are amortized over a twenty year period 
approximately percent and percent of the original deferred costs related to group disability products are expected to be amortized by years ten and fifteen  respectively 
for individual disability policies  approximately percent and percent of the original deferred costs are expected to be amortized by years ten and fifteen  respectively 
deferred costs for group life products are amortized over a fifteen year period  with approximately percent of the cost expected to remain at year ten 
valuation of fixed maturity securities in determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary  the company evaluates market conditions  relevant industry conditions and trends  rating agency actions  offering prices  trends of earnings  and other key measures for the related security 
when a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the company recognizes an impairment loss in the current period results to the extent of the decline in value 
private placement fixed maturity securities with a carrying value of approximately billion  or percent of total fixed maturity securities at december   do not have readily determinable market prices 
for these securities  the company uses internally prepared valuations combining matrix pricing with vendor purchased software programs  including valuations based on estimates of future profitability  to estimate the fair value 
all such investments are classified as available for sale 
the company s ability to liquidate its positions in some of these securities could be impacted to a significant degree by the lack of an actively traded market  and the company may not be able to dispose of these investments in a timely manner 
although the company believes its estimates reasonably reflect the fair value of those securities  the key assumptions about the risk free interest rates  risk premiums  performance of underlying collateral if any  and other factors may not reflect those of an active market 
the company believes that generally these private placement securities carry a credit quality comparable to companies rated baa by major credit rating organizations 
as of december   the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of private placement fixed maturity securities included the following 
risk free interest rates of percent for five year maturities to percent for year maturities were derived from the current yield curve for us treasury bonds with similar maturities 

current baa corporate bond spreads ranging from percent to percent plus an additional basis points were added to the risk free rate to consider the lack of liquidity 

an additional ten basis points were added to the risk free rates for foreign investments 

additional basis points were added as deemed appropriate for securities in certain industries that are considered to be of greater risk 
historically  the company s realized gains or losses on dispositions of its private placement fixed maturity securities have not varied significantly from amounts estimated under the valuation methodology described above 
reinsurance receivable reinsurance is a contractual agreement whereby the company s reinsurance partners assume a defined portion of the risk for future benefits payable under reinsurance contracts 
the reinsurance receivable reported as an asset in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition includes amounts due from the company s reinsurers on current claims and estimates of amounts that will be due on future claims 
policy reserves and claim reserves reported in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition are not reduced for reinsurance 
the reinsurance receivable is generally equal to the policy reserves and claim reserves related to the risk being reinsured 
the company reduces the reinsurance receivable if recovery is not likely due to the financial position of the reinsurer or if there is disagreement between the company and the reinsurer regarding the liability of the reinsurer 
results of operations significant transactions and events the september  tragedy resulted in a before tax charge of million  or million after tax 
this charge included estimated gross ultimate losses from reported and unreported claims of million less an estimated million recoverable from the company s reinsurers 
the charge did not include any indirect costs which the company incurred in developing specialized procedures for filing claims resulting from the attacks and in providing additional support to impacted policyholders and group clients 
the company s reinsurance program provides a significant layer of catastrophic coverage for its individual disability and its group life  accidental death and dismemberment  travel accident  long term disability  and short term disability lines of business through a group of highly rated major national and international reinsurance organizations 
because of the quality and level of the company s various reinsurance coverages  the company does not anticipate that any of its reinsurers will be unable to cover the claims incurred as a result of the events 
should this occur  however  all of the company s insurance subsidiaries are sufficiently capitalized such that each insurance subsidiary will be able to satisfy these claims and will face no liquidity or risk based capital issues 
the effects on each line of business are disclosed in the following discussions of segment operating results

additionally  as a result of tax legislation enacted in the united kingdom during that allows additional group tax relief among companies with common ownership  the company began recognizing foreign tax benefits during during the company redeemed its million par value monthly income debt securities junior subordinated debt  which were due in but callable at par in and thereafter 
this early redemption is expected to lower the company s financing costs in through the use of commercial paper available at lower interest rates

the extraordinary loss  net of a million tax benefit  was million 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations  and no

in connection with the initial adoption of sfas  the company will perform the required transitional goodwill impairment tests 
any impairment loss resulting from the transitional goodwill impairment tests will be recognized as the effect of a change in accounting principle and will be presented as a separate caption  net of tax  in the income statement 
the impairment loss  if any  is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
significant transactions and events during  the company completed a series of strategic transactions designed to more closely focus its operations on its core businesses  increase its financial flexibility  support its present credit and claims paying ratings  increase the risk based capital ratios of the insurance subsidiaries involved  and lower its leverage ratios 
the primary transaction involved agreements under which the company reinsured on a percent indemnity coinsurance basis substantially all of the individual life insurance and corporate owned life insurance policies written by the company s insurance subsidiaries  as well as a small block of individually underwritten group life insurance

see the discussions of segment operating results contained herein for further information 
significant transactions and events as a result of the aforementioned merger at june   certain accounting policy changes were made during the following summarizes these changes as well as the expenses related to the merger and the early retirement offer to employees 
generally  because of the effort and time involved  reviews and updates of assumptions related to benefit liabilities are periodically undertaken over time and are reflected in the calculation of benefit liabilities as completed 
many factors influence assumptions underlying reserves  and considerable judgment is required to interpret current and historical experience underlying all of the assumptions and to assess the future factors that are likely to influence the ultimate cost of settling existing claims 
prior to the june  merger  unum s process and assumptions used to calculate the discount rate for claim reserves of certain disability businesses differed from that used by provident 
while unum s and provident s methods for calculating the discount rate for disability claim reserves were both in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  management believed that the combined entity should have consistent discount rate accounting policies and methods for applying these policies for similar products 
the previous unum methodology used the same investment strategy for assets backing both liabilities and surplus 
provident s methodology  which allows for different investment strategies for assets backing surplus than those backing product liabilities  was determined by management to be the more appropriate approach for the combined entity 
accordingly  at june   the company adopted provident s method of calculating the discount rate for claim reserves 
the impact on earnings related to the change in method of calculating the discount rate for claim reserves was million before tax and million after tax 
the charge was reflected in the employee benefits  individual  and other segments as an increase in benefits to policyholders of million  million  and million  respectively 
subsequent to the merger date  the company began to integrate the valuation procedures of the two organizations to provide for a more effective linking of pricing and reserving assumptions and to facilitate a more efficient process for adjusting liabilities to emerging trends 
included in this integration activity were a review and an update of assumptions that underlie policy and contract benefit liabilities 
the purpose of the study was to confirm or update the assumptions which were viewed as likely to affect the ultimate liability for contract benefits 
accordingly  as a result of the merger  the company accelerated the performance of its normal reviews of the assumptions underlying reserves to determine the assumptions that the newly merged company will use in the future for pricing  performance management  and reserving 
the review resulted in an increase in the benefits and reserves for future benefits for the company s domestic group long term disability unpaid claim liabilities 
as a result of the review  the company increased its policy and contract benefit liabilities million in the third quarter of  which reduced results million before tax and million after tax 
during  the company recorded before tax expenses related to the merger of approximately million million after tax for severance and related costs  exit costs for duplicate facilities and asset abandonments  and investment banking  legal  and accounting fees 
the company also recorded in a before tax expense of approximately million million after tax related to the early retirement offer to the company s employees 
these expenses are reported in the corporate segment as other operating expenses and are further discussed in the section corporate segment operating results 
additionally  in the company expensed million million after tax of incremental costs associated with the merger 
these incremental costs consist primarily of compensation  training  integration  and licensing costs 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these charges and liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of capital and financing needs 
during the company also recognized million of before tax charges related to its reinsurance operations 
these charges were as follows in millions of dollars north american reinsurance operations loss on sale of a h and ltc reinsurance management operations includes write off of million of goodwill loss on reinsurance of a h and ltc risk participations provision for losses on retained business international reinsurance operations provision for losses on lloyd s of london syndicate participations provision for losses on reinsurance pool participations other than lloyd s goodwill impairment excluding amount recognized on sale total before tax charge see other segment operating results and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these charges and the company s reinsurance operations 
a portion of the losses recognized in relating to the company s reinsurance operations does not receive a tax benefit  which unfavorably impacted the effective tax rate 
additionally  a portion of the expenses related to the merger was non deductible for federal income tax purposes  resulting in a tax rate that was less than the us federal statutory tax rate of percent 
in  the company recorded refunds from the internal revenue service relating to the final settlement of remaining issues for the through tax years 
the refund of taxes was million  and interest on the refunds was million 
overall  including interest and the tax provision thereon  results increased million due to settlements of prior year tax issues

the company has adjusted its focus within the employee benefits segment to integrated selling that combines long term disability  short term disability  and group life products 
during  percent of all new sales included long term disability  short term disability  and group life combined coverage 
this compares to percent and percent for and  respectively 
sales for employee benefits  on both a submitted and effective date basis  are as follows in millions of dollars year ended december change change sales submitted date basis group long term disability group short term disability group life accidental death dismemberment and group long term care total sales effective date basis long term disability short term disability group life accidental death dismemberment and group long term care total  sales related to employee benefits can fluctuate significantly due to large case size and timing of sales submissions 
the company implemented a number of initiatives throughout which helped maintain the sales momentum achieved during the last half of and continuing into  including targeted incentive plans  organizational changes to create a greater focus on the customer  and enhanced communication with producers 
in order to give the appropriate focus to the company s primary business markets  the company has national practice groups that focus on large employers  executive benefits  and voluntary benefits 
these national practice groups partner with the company s sales force and representatives from claims  customer service  and underwriting to present coverage solutions to potential customers and to manage existing customer accounts 
the company expects that these actions will continue to favorably impact sales growth  but management intends to maintain pricing discipline to balance sales growth and profitability  which may slow the rate of long term sales growth 
the company monitors persistency and reflects adverse changes in persistency in the current period s amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
persistency during for group disability  group life  and accidental death and dismemberment products was generally improved overall from that experienced in but was unfavorable for certain issue years when compared to the persistency expected at the time the business was written  resulting in additional amortization of million 
the majority of the unfavorable persistency occurred in more recently issued business  which has higher associated unamortized deferred policy acquisition costs 
the additional amortization related to persistency in and was million and million  respectively 
it is expected that persistency for the foreseeable future may continue to be lower than historical levels 
the company s renewal program was generally successful at retaining business that is relatively more profitable than business that terminated 
it is expected that the additional premium and related profits associated with renewal activity will emerge throughout the company intends to maintain a disciplined approach in the re pricing of renewal business  while balancing the need to maximize persistency and retain producer relationships 
this approach may lead to lower profit margins on affected cases than originally planned 
revenue from the managed disability line of business  which includes the company s wholly owned subsidiaries genex services  inc and options and choices  inc  totaled million in  compared to million in and million in group disability group disability revenue was  million in compared to  million in group disability reported income of million for compared to million for group disability results for include million for losses related to september   with estimated gross ultimate losses from reported and unreported claims of million less an estimated million recoverable from the company s reinsurers 
the income for includes an increase of million in group long term disability claim reserves  discussed more fully below 
positive impacts on income were a million revenue increase and a change in the benefit ratio from percent in to percent in  excluding losses related to september for and the million reserve increase for the commission ratio also improved slightly relative to negatively impacting income was an increase in the operating expense ratio in compared to the results include million of additional amortization necessitated by the higher level of group long term and short term disability terminations experienced during relative to that which was expected at the time the business was written 
the additional amortization during was million 
for both and  the disability business retained is relatively more profitable than the business that terminated 
a critical part of the company s strategy for group disability involves executing its renewal program and managing persistency  both of which management expects will have a positive impact on future premium growth and profitability 
the company has implemented pricing changes in the group disability line wherein prices may increase or decrease by market segment  as appropriate  to respond to current claim experience and other factors and assumptions 
persistency during on the overall block of group disability improved over  with long term disability persistency at percent compared to percent last year and short term disability at percent versus percent in however  persistency on business sold in and has been unfavorable when compared to what was expected when the business was sold  resulting in additional amortization of the deferred policy acquisition costs that have a relatively high remaining asset balance 
the fundamentals underlying risk results in the group disability line continued to exhibit overall improvement in  as demonstrated by the lower benefit ratio 
claim recovery rates in continued to be above historical levels but the increase in the claim recovery rates has slowed  as expected  as the company has now fully implemented the improvements to its claim processes 
both submitted and paid claim incidence for long term disability increased over recent years  with a portion of the increase attributable to industries impacted by the weaker economy 
however  in comparing results with  there was no significant increase in the types of claims normally associated with a weaker economy 
for short term disability  both the average claim duration and paid incidence increased from the prior year 
the average weekly indemnity continued to increase as well  but the premium per life grew at a slightly higher level 
the company expects to modify its product and pricing strategy in short term disability to be more selective in the product options offered in the large case market  with a focus on self funded or experience rated products 
group disability revenue was  million in compared to  million in the high terminations and slow sales decreased the earned premium growth compared to that experienced during and group disability reported income of million for compared to a loss of million for included in the income for was an increase of million in group long term disability claim reserves  which represented approximately percent of total group long term disability claim reserves 
the increase  which resulted from lengthening the projected average claim duration for certain of the company s group long term disability claims  was not a result of deteriorating experience but was believed appropriate based on the company s assessment of the ultimate settlement of these claims 
the loss of million was the result of the million charge resulting from lowering the discount rate used to calculate certain of unum s disability claim reserves to conform with provident s process and assumptions and the million charge resulting from the revision in the underlying assumptions used to estimate the ultimate cost of unpaid group long term disability claims  as discussed in the preceding results of operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
excluding the adjustments to the disability claim liabilities discussed in the preceding paragraph  the benefit ratio for group disability was percent in compared to percent in for long term disability  the ratio for was higher than in the paid claim incidence for long term disability was lower than due to lower claim acceptance rates  and the rate of net claim resolutions continued to increase during the submitted claim incidence rate for long term disability was higher than the rate for the claims disruption charge taken in the fourth quarter of resulted in a million charge for the group long term disability line of business for the expected increase in claims durations due to management s expectation that productivity in the claims organization would be impacted as a result of planning  consolidation  and integration efforts related to the merger 
if the impact of merger related claim operations integration activities on claim durations had not been anticipated at december   the loss for the group long term disability line of business would have been negatively impacted by million 
however  the shortfall of the actual experience below that assumed resulted in a negative effect on results of million 
the benefit ratio for short term disability decreased marginally during from the ratio 
the incidence of submitted claims for short term disability remained relatively constant throughout and  declining slightly in compared to the rate 
negative impacts on the benefit ratio in were the average claim duration  which increased to its highest level in recent periods during  and an increase in the average weekly indemnity 
additionally  the increase in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs had a negative impact on income 
this increase resulted from million of additional amortization necessitated by the higher level of group long term and short term disability terminations experienced during relative to that which was expected at the time the business was written 
the additional amortization during was million 
also included in is million of amortization related to the write off of the unamortized balance of deferred costs related to certain discontinued products in the foreign operations 
income in was positively impacted by a percent revenue increase and an improvement in both the commission and operating expense ratios relative to as previously disclosed under results of operations  during the company entered into a percent indemnity coinsurance agreement to cede the future claim payments on one of its insurance subsidiaries long duration group long term disability claims which were incurred prior to january  the agreement was effective january  as discussed under cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements  certain risks and uncertainties are inherent in the company s business 
components of claims experience  including but not limited to  incidence levels and claims duration  may be worse than expected 
management monitors claims experience in group disability and responds to changes by periodically adjusting prices  refining underwriting guidelines  changing product features  and strengthening risk management policies and procedures 
the company expects to price new business and re price existing business  at contract renewal dates  in an attempt to mitigate the effect of these and other factors  including interest rates  on new claim liabilities 
given the competitive market conditions for the company s disability products  it is uncertain whether pricing actions can entirely mitigate the effect 
the company  similar to all financial institutions  has some exposure if a severe and prolonged recession occurs  but management believes that the company is well positioned if a weaker economy were to occur 
many of the company s products can be re priced  which would allow the company to reflect in its pricing any fundamental change which might occur in the risk associated with a particular industry or company within an industry 
the company has a well diversified book of insurance exposure  with no disproportionate concentrations of risk in any one industry 
because of improvements made in the claims organization in recent years  the company believes it can respond to increased levels of submitted claims which might result from a slowing economy 
group life  accidental death and dismemberment  and long term care group life  accidental death and dismemberment  and long term care reported income of million in compared to million in included in income is additional benefit expense of million related to the september  tragedy 
group life  accidental death and dismemberment  and long term care reported an increase in revenue for compared to due to increases in both premium income and net investment income 
premium growth was attributable to strong sales results in and improvements in persistency 
persistency for group life was percent in  an increase over the percent for for accidental death and dismemberment  persistency was percent and percent for and  respectively 
offsetting the revenue increase was an increase in the benefit ratio and operating expense ratio when compared to the previous year reporting period 
the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for includes million of additional amortization due to the higher level of terminations for group life and accidental death and dismemberment products experienced than expected at the time the policies were written 
the unfavorable variance of actual to expected terminations occurred primarily in the group life product line 
the additional amortization during was million 
group life submitted and paid incidence continued to remain high in  although the incidence rates during the last six months of the year were lower than the rates for the first half of the average paid claim size has also increased compared to the prior year  and waiver incidence continues to be above recent levels 
the claim recovery rate on waiver claims has increased  somewhat mitigating the impact of the increase in waiver incidence 
group life benefits include estimated gross ultimate losses from reported and unreported claims of million less an estimated million recoverable from the company s reinsurers  for a net increase in benefits of million related to the september  tragedy 
the company has implemented several actions in the group life line of business  including tighter underwriting guidelines and pricing changes  and is developing case specific remedial plans for under performing business 
the company believes these actions will improve profitability in group life  but it is uncertain whether these actions will restore the profitability that this line of business has historically reported 
as a result of the actions implemented  it is expected that the sales growth rate in this business will slow from that experienced in recent years 
this was evidenced by the rate of growth reported for group life sales in the fourth quarter of  with a percent and percent decline  compared to the fourth quarter of  reported for submitted and effective date basis sales  respectively 
the benefit ratio for accidental death and dismemberment was higher than primarily due to a significant increase in the average paid claim amounts 
the rate of claim incidence in did not change significantly over the prior year 
the results for accidental death and dismemberment include estimated gross ultimate losses of million less estimated reinsurance recoverables of million  for a net increase in benefits of million related to the september  tragedy 
these losses relate to both accidental death and dismemberment and travel accident coverages 
group long term care reported a very slight decrease in the benefit ratio for compared to  although the last two quarters of reported increasing benefit ratios relative to the first half of the year and to prior year quarters 
the reinsurance transaction entered into during under which an insurance subsidiary of the company cedes through a net quota share reinsurance agreement percent of the group life volume above the aggregate retention limit does not meet the conditions for reinsurance accounting and is therefore accounted for as a deposit 
as such  there is no effect on reported premium income or benefits 
the only impact on the income statement is the risk charge paid to the reinsurers 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the reinsurance transactions 
group life  accidental death and dismemberment  and long term care reported income of million in compared to million in group life and long term care both reported an increase in revenue for compared to due to increases in premium income and net investment income 
offsetting the revenue increase was an increase in the benefit ratio when compared to group life reported a higher benefit ratio in compared to the prior year due to an increase in the average paid claim size and waiver incidence  partially offset by a decrease in paid mortality incidence 
the benefit ratio for accidental death and dismemberment was higher than due to an increase in the average paid claim size 
submitted incidence for accidental death and dismemberment improved relative to group long term care reported a higher benefit ratio for compared to the long term care net claim resolution rate for is below the average rate for  primarily due to a decrease in claim recoveries 
the incidence rates for both submitted and paid claims improved over the prior year 
the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for includes million of additional amortization due to the higher level of terminations for group life and accidental death and dismemberment products experienced during relative to that which was expected at the time the policies were written 
positively impacting income was an improvement in the commission and operating expense ratios 
individual segment operating results in millions of dollars year ended december change change revenue premium income individual disability    individual long term care total premium income    net investment income other income total    benefits and expenses benefits and change in reserves for future benefits    commissions deferral of policy acquisition costs amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs amortization of value of business acquired operating expenses total    income before federal income tax  net realized investment gain loss  and extraordinary loss the individual segment includes results from the individual disability and individual long term care lines of business 
individual disability new annualized sales in the individual disability line of business were million in  compared to million in and million in the company developed a new individual disability product portfolio that was released for sale in approved states early in the fourth quarter of the new portfolio utilizes a modular approach offering customers a range of product options and features 
this portfolio was designed to combine the best features from prior company offerings and includes return to work incentives and optional long term care conversion benefits and or benefits for catastrophic disabilities 
management expects that premium income in the individual disability line will grow on a year over year basis as the portfolio transition produces increasing levels of new sales of individual disability products and as a result of an increased focus on integrated disability sales in group and individual  as well as other sales initiatives discussed under employee benefits segment operating results 
the persistency of individual disability business continues to be stable 
revenue was  million for compared to  million in income in the individual disability line of business was million in  a decrease of percent over the prior year 
included in the results for was million of estimated gross ultimate losses related to september   less an estimated recoverable from reinsurers of million 
excluding this million loss  income would have been essentially level with the benefit ratio of percent for was slightly higher than the ratio of percent 
the interest adjusted loss ratio was percent and percent for and  respectively 
submitted and paid claim incidence rates for the overall individual disability line of business increased from and are higher than recent historical incidence rates 
the claim recovery rate for increased compared to the results 
individual disability also benefited from a slightly improved commission ratio for as compared to  but the operating expense ratio increased 
the overall individual disability results for were negatively impacted by the business issued during the mid s and prior years 
the interest adjusted loss ratios for later issue years are significantly below the overall ratio of percent  even in the more poorly performing market segments and product lines

investments investment activities are an integral part of the company s business  and profitability is significantly affected by investment results 
invested assets are segmented into portfolios  which support the various product lines 
generally  the investment strategy for the portfolios is to match the effective asset cash flows and durations with related expected liability cash flows and durations and to maximize investment returns  subject to constraints of quality  liquidity  diversification  and regulatory considerations 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s investments and derivative financial instruments 
excluding the net investment income reported in the other segment  which continues its expected decline as these product lines are sold  reinsured  or wind down  net investment income increased percent over the previous year

during  the company reported a net realized investment loss before tax of million  including the realized investment loss of million on the investment grade fixed maturity securities transferred to the reinsurer in connection with the individual life and corporate owned life reinsurance transactions 
the loss on these transferred securities was driven by a change in market interest rates and was not attributable to any credit deterioration

offsetting this gain was a million realized investment loss recognized because the value of certain fixed maturity securities had other than temporarily declined 
the following table provides the distribution of invested assets for the years indicated 
policy loans are reported on a gross basis in the consolidated statements of financial condition and in the table below 
policy loans of billion and billion were ceded as of december  and  respectively  and the investment income thereon is no longer included in income 
december investment grade fixed maturity securities below investment grade fixed maturity securities equity securities mortgage loans real estate policy loans other invested assets total fixed maturity securities the company s investment in mortgage backed securities was approximately billion and billion on an amortized cost basis at december  and  respectively 
at december   the mortgage backed securities had an average life of years and effective duration of years 
the mortgage backed securities are valued on a monthly basis using valuations supplied by the brokerage firms that are dealers in these securities 
the primary risk involved in investing in mortgage backed securities is the uncertainty of the timing of cash flows from the underlying loans due to prepayment of principal 
the company uses models which incorporate economic variables and possible future interest rate scenarios to predict future prepayment rates 
the company has not invested in mortgage backed derivatives  such as interest only  principal only or residuals  where market values can be highly volatile relative to changes in interest rates 
the company s exposure to below investment grade fixed maturity securities at december   was  million  representing percent of invested assets excluding ceded policy loans  below the company s internal limit of percent of invested assets for this type of investment 
the company s exposure to below investment grade fixed maturities totaled  million at december   representing percent of invested assets 
the year over year increase resulted from downgrades of existing securities that were previously investment grade rather than the purchase of additional below investment grade securities 
below investment grade bonds are inherently more risky than investment grade bonds since the risk of default by the issuer  by definition and as exhibited by bond rating  is higher 
also  the secondary market for certain below investment grade issues can be highly illiquid 
the company expects additional downgrades to occur during  with resulting realized investment losses 
the company does not anticipate any liquidity problem caused by the investments in below investment grade securities  nor does it expect these investments to adversely affect its ability to hold its other investments to maturity 
the company has investments in four special purpose entities whose purposes are to support the company s investment objectives 
these entities are for asset collateralization and contain specific investment securities that do not include the company s common stock or debt 
these investments are described as follows during  the company invested in two special purpose entity trusts that have underlying assets consisting of unrelated equity securities 
the investments in these trusts qualify as fixed maturity securities under generally accepted accounting principles and were reported at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition contained herein in item the fair value of these investments was derived from the fair value of the underlying assets based on quoted market prices 
the fair value and amortized cost of these investments were million and million  respectively  at december  the company has an investment in a collateralized bond obligation asset trust in which it is also the investment manager of the underlying high yield securities 
this investment was reported at fair value with fixed maturity securities in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
the fair value of this investment was derived from the fair value of the underlying assets based on quoted market prices 
the fair value and amortized cost of this investment was million and million  respectively  at december  and million and million at december  at december   the company had a retained interest in a special purpose entity trust that was securitized with financial assets consisting of a united states treasury bond and several limited partnership equity interests 
this investment was reported at fair value and included with fixed maturity securities in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
the fair value of this investment was derived from the fair value of the underlying assets  which are based on quoted market prices as well as the limited partnership capital balances 
the fair value and amortized cost of this investment was million and million  respectively  at december  and million and million at december  at december   the company had capital commitments of million to this special purpose entity trust 
these funds are due upon satisfaction of contractual notice from the trust 
these amounts may or may not be funded during the term of the trust 
mortgage loans and real estate the company s mortgage loan portfolio was million and  million at december  and  respectively 
the mortgage loan portfolio is well diversified geographically and among property types

no new mortgage loans were added to the company s investment portfolio during and other than two purchase money mortgages associated with the sale of real estate 
at december  and  impaired loans totaled million and million  respectively 
included in the impaired mortgage loans at december  were million of loans which had a related  specific investment valuation allowance of million and million of loans which had no related  specific allowance 
impaired mortgage loans are not expected to have a material impact on the company s liquidity  financial position  or results of operations 
restructured mortgage loans totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  and represent loans that have been refinanced with terms more favorable to the borrower 
interest lost on restructured loans was immaterial for and real estate was million and million at december  and investment real estate is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
real estate acquired through foreclosure is valued at fair value at the date of foreclosure and may be classified as investment real estate if it meets the company s investment criteria 
if investment real estate is determined to be permanently impaired  the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to fair value 
occasionally  investment real estate is reclassified to real estate held for sale when it no longer meets the company s investment criteria 
real estate held for sale  which is valued net of a valuation allowance that reduces the carrying value to the lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell  amounted to million at december   and million at december  the company uses a comprehensive rating system to evaluate the investment and credit risk of each mortgage loan and to identify specific properties for inspection and reevaluation 
the company establishes an investment valuation allowance for mortgage loans based on a review of individual loans and the overall loan portfolio  considering the value of the underlying collateral 
investment valuation allowances for real estate held for sale are established based on a review of specific assets 
if a decline in value of a mortgage loan or real estate investment is considered to be other than temporary or if the asset is deemed permanently impaired  the investment is reduced to estimated net realizable value  and the reduction is recognized as a realized investment loss 
management monitors the risk associated with these invested asset portfolios and regularly reviews and adjusts the investment valuation allowance 
as a result of management s most recent review of the overall mortgage loan portfolio and based on management s expectation that delinquencies and problem loans will remain low  the valuation allowance on mortgage loans was reduced million during the real estate valuation allowance was reduced million during in conjunction with the sale of the associated property 
at december   the balance in the valuation allowance for mortgage loans and real estate was million and million  respectively 
other the company s exposure to non current investments totaled million at december   or percent of invested assets excluding ceded policy loans 
these non current investments are foreclosed real estate held for sale and fixed income securities and mortgage loans that became more than thirty days past due in principal and interest payments 
the company has an investment program wherein it simultaneously enters into repurchase transactions and reverse repurchase transactions with the same party 
the company nets the related receivables and payables in the consolidated statements of financial condition as these transactions are with the same party and include a right of offset 
as of december   the company had million face value of these contracts in an open position that were offset 
historically  the company has utilized interest rate futures contracts  current and forward interest rate swaps  interest rate forward contracts  and options on forward interest rate swaps  forward treasuries  or specific fixed income securities to manage duration and increase yield on cash flows expected from current holdings and future premium income 
positions under the company s hedging programs for derivative activity that were open during involved current and forward interest rate swaps  as well as currency swaps which are used to hedge the currency risk of certain foreign currency denominated fixed income securities 
all transactions are hedging in nature and not speculative 
almost all transactions are associated with the individual and group long term care and the individual and group disability product portfolios 
all other product portfolios are periodically reviewed to determine if hedging strategies would be appropriate for risk management purposes 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity requirements are met primarily by cash flows provided from operations  principally in its insurance subsidiaries 
premium and investment income  as well as maturities and sales of invested assets  provide the primary sources of cash 
cash is applied to the payment of policy benefits  costs of acquiring new business principally commissions  and operating expenses as well as purchases of new investments 
the company has established an investment strategy that management believes will provide for adequate cash flows from operations 
cash flows from operations were  million for the year ended december   as compared to  million and  million for the comparable periods of and  respectively 
the company believes the cash flows from its operations will be sufficient to meet its operating and financial cash flow requirements  excluding the strain placed on capital as a result of the charges recorded in connection with the merger 
as a result of the effect on capital during of the merger related charges  the company raised approximately million through the debt markets during the fourth quarter of by securing million of one year bank debt and by issuing commercial paper 
the company s source of cash could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for the company s insurance products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims 
the company s policy benefits are primarily in the form of claim payments  and the company therefore has minimal exposure to the policy withdrawal risk associated with deposit products such as individual life policies or annuities 
cash flow could also be negatively impacted by a deterioration in the credit market whereby the company s ability to liquidate its positions in certain of its fixed maturity securities would be impacted such that the company might not be able to dispose of these investments in a timely manner 
the company is dependent upon payments from its subsidiaries to pay dividends to its stockholders and to pay its expenses 
these payments by the company s insurance and non insurance subsidiaries may take the form of interest payments on amounts loaned to such subsidiaries by the company  operating and investment management fees  and or dividends 
at december   the company had outstanding from its insurance subsidiaries a million surplus debenture due in with a weighted average interest rate during of percent and a million surplus debenture due in with a weighted average interest rate during of percent 
semi annual interest payments are conditional upon the approval by the insurance department of the state of domicile 
restrictions under applicable insurance laws limit the amount of ordinary dividends that can be paid to the company from its insurance subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities 
generally  for life insurance subsidiaries domiciled or commercially domiciled in the united states  that limitation equals the greater of ten percent of an insurer s statutory surplus with respect to policyholders as of the preceding year end or the statutory net gain from operations  excluding realized investment gains and losses  of the preceding year 
further  pursuant to the merger of unum and provident  the company is required to obtain approval from the maine bureau of insurance maine bureau regarding payment of ordinary dividends from the company s maine domiciled insurance subsidiary until the payment of ordinary dividends to the company from its insurance subsidiaries is further limited to the amount of statutory surplus as it relates to policyholders

approximately million will be available for the payment of dividends from unum limited during the amount available during for the payment of ordinary dividends from the company s domestic insurance subsidiaries was million  including million available with approval from the maine bureau 
of the total available  million was utilized  including million as requested by the company and approved by the maine bureau 
the amount available during from unum limited was million  none of which was utilized 
the ability of the company to continue to receive dividends from its insurance subsidiaries without regulatory approval will be dependent upon the level of earnings of its insurance subsidiaries as calculated under law 
in addition to regulatory restrictions  the amount of dividends that will be paid by insurance subsidiaries will depend on additional factors  such as risk based capital ratios  funding growth objectives at an affiliate level  and maintaining appropriate capital adequacy ratios to support the ratings desired by the company 
regulatory restrictions do not limit the amount of dividends available for distribution to the company from its non insurance subsidiaries

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 
the following discussion regarding the company s risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
estimates of future performance and economic conditions are reflected assuming certain changes in market rates and prices were to occur sensitivity analysis 
caution should be used in evaluating the company s overall market risk from the information presented below  as actual results may differ 
the company employs various derivative programs to manage these material market risks 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussions of the qualitative aspects of market risk  including derivative financial instrument activity 
interest rate risk the operations of the company are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations  primarily long term us interest rates 
changes in interest rates and individuals behavior affect the amount and timing of asset and liability cash flows 
management continually models and tests asset and liability portfolios to improve interest rate risk management and net yields 
testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate and economic scenarios allows management to choose the most appropriate investment strategy  as well as to prepare for disadvantageous outcomes 
this analysis is the precursor to the company s activities in derivative financial instruments 
the company uses interest rate swaps  interest rate forward contracts  exchange traded interest rate futures contracts  and options to hedge interest rate risks and to match asset durations and cash flows with corresponding liabilities 
assuming an immediate increase of basis points in interest rates from year end levels  the net hypothetical decrease in stockholders equity related to financial and derivative instruments was estimated to be billion at december  and the fair values of mortgage loans  which are reported in the consolidated statements of financial condition at amortized cost  would decrease by approximately million and million  respectively  at december  and held to maturity securities are also reported at amortized cost and would decrease by approximately million at december  there were no held to maturity securities at december  at december  and  assuming a basis point decrease in long term interest rates from year end levels  the fair values of the company s long term debt would increase approximately million and million  respectively  and the fair values of the company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities would increase approximately million and million  respectively
