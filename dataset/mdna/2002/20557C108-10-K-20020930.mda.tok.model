these non cash expenses increased from an adjustment to the volatility computations applied in the black scholes equation we used to calculate the fair value of options and warrants issued to consultants and beach boulevard  llc 
the company s financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year were affected by an approximate million asset impairment loss related to the writeoff of goodwill

our cash requirements include general corporate expenses including salaries and benefits  lease payments for office space  technology acquisition  software license and maintenance contract payments  legal and accounting fees  clinical trial and technical support  fda consulting  marketing  and expenses associated with the private placement of our equity securities 
capital resources needed to meet our past and planned expenditures have been financed and are likely to continue to be primarily from the sale of equity securities 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years operating leases     debenture   penalty   interest on debenture   total commercial commitments     agreement with beach boulevard  llc 
on december   we reached a financing agreement the agreement with beach boulevard  llc the investor  pursuant to which the we issued a percent convertible debenture in the amount of million the debenture offering and secured an equity line of credit the equity line for million that allows the us to sell up to million in common stock to the investor at percent of the market price  as defined by the agreement 
the convertible debenture is due on december  the terms of the agreement permit the investor to convert the convertible debenture into common stock at a conversion price of per share at any time during the term of the agreement 
in connection with the agreement  we entered into a registration rights agreement and subsequently filed an effective registration statement with the sec 
the investor may require us to redeem all or a portion of the convertible debenture if the average closing bid price of the our common stock for the consecutive trading days after the effective date of the registration statement is less than a trigger event 
the amount redeemable is equal to percent of the principal balance of the convertible debenture and accrued interest the redeemable balance 
if a trigger event occurs  the investor is required to provide notice to us of its election to force redemption and to specify the date the redemption due date on which the redeemable balance is to be paid 
if we do not pay the redeemable balance in full by the redemption due date  we are required to issue registered unrestricted shares of common stock pursuant to a series of put notices consistent with the terms of the equity line 
if the redeemable balance is not satisfied through the mandatory puts within six months of the investor s notice to force redemption  the unpaid portion of the redeemable balance is required to be paid immediately 
on july   the investor notified us that a trigger event had occurred 
on the date of the trigger event  the redeemable balance was approximately million  which includes principal of million   of accrued interest and  of penalty 
we elected to satisfy the redeemable balance through a series of put notices based on the terms of the equity line 
the terms of the equity line provide for one mandatory put per month and a maximum put amount equal to the lesser of  or percent of the weighted average volume for the days immediately preceding the date of the put notice 
based on the terms of the equity line and the weighted average volume for the days preceding the first put on august   we estimate we will be able to pay approximately  of the redeemable balance before the end of the six month period 
the remaining unpaid balance will then be due in cash 
the equity line allows for the sale of up to million of common stock subject to certain conditions during a month period  at percent of the then current market price 
we believe our availability under the equity line will be significantly less than million because availability is contingent upon a our common stock price and b our daily trading volume both of which have declined since we entered into the financing arrangement  and because we are using the equity line to redeem the debenture as described above 
in connection with the agreement  we issued the investor warrants for the purchase of  shares of common stock at a share and  shares of common stock at a share  which expire december   and december   respectively 
the proceeds from the debenture offering were allocated between the convertible debenture  the beneficial conversion feature  and the warrants issued to the investor 
we also issued separate warrants to an investment bank for the purchase of  shares of common stock at per share 
the fair market value of these warrants and other related financing costs have been recorded as deferred financing costs and are being amortized over the three year term of the agreement 
capital requirements plan of operation our capital requirements may vary from our estimates and depend upon numerous factors including a progress in our research and development programs  b results of pre clinical and clinical testing  c costs of technology  d time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  e costs of filing  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  f the economic impact of developments in competing technology and our markets  g competing technological and market developments  h the terms of any new collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  and i litigation costs 
we estimate that we will require approximately million in net cash to meet our operating and financing goals for the fiscal year ending june  if we are able to satisfy our operating and financing needs through increased revenue and securing additional equity or debt financing  we expect to use approximately a million to fund research and development to continue our clinical studies  test our medical systems in connection with other clinical applications  and expand our industrial applications  b million for day to day operating expenses including lease payments on our facilities  c million to cover salaries not including r d salaries  d million for public relations  advertising  and commercialization of our products  e million for capital expenditures  and f million for legal  accounting and litigation settlement expenses 
in  five different lawsuits were filed against us in the united states district court in oregon 
each suit makes substantially the same allegations the company misled shareholders regarding such things as fda approval and other matters  which the plaintiff s believe caused significant damage to the shareholders holding shares of our common stock at the time of these alleged misrepresentations and omissions 
the company believes the allegations are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously 
however  defending these lawsuits  which we believe will be consolidated into a single lawsuit  will require additional legal expenses to defend  may make fund raising more difficult if not impossible and will distract certain members of management from day to day operations 
moreover  our insurance carrier has denied there is insurance coverage for the plaintiff s claims and  accordingly  has indicated it will not cover the costs of defending the claims and will not pay any resulting damages we may suffer if the plaintiff s are successful 
finally  under our bylaws and contractual agreements we are required to indemnify our current and former officers and directors who are a party to the litigation by providing legal defense through our attorneys or reimbursing them for their own attorneys and covering all damages they may suffer if the plaintiffs are successful 
we do not have sufficient capital to cover the expected costs or potential damages of the shareholder litigation if there is no coverage under our insurance policies or to fund our business plans over the next year 
we will have to obtain additional capital through loans  the sale of assets or capital contributions from private investors 
we are working with an investment banking firm and  we believe that we will be able to acquire the capital needed to carry out our business plans  however  if we are not successful  we will have to scale back our business plans

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are a development stage enterprise 
we currently believe we are not subject to market risks beyond ordinary economic risks  such as interest rate fluctuation and inflation 
as we begin to market our products  we become exposed to the opportunities and risks usually associated with marketing and manufacturing novel products  including staff recruiting and retention  market acceptance  product warranty  bad debts  and inventory obsolescence 
at june   we had invested approximately million in available for sale marketable securities including investments in united states government securities and corporate bonds 
although we believe the issuers of these marketable securities are solvent and are favorably rated by recognized rating agencies  there is the risk that such issuers may not have sufficient liquid assets to satisfy their obligations at the time such obligations become due 
if such were to occur  we may not be able to recover the full amount of our investment 
each of our marketable securities has a fixed rate of interest 
accordingly  a change in market interest rates may result in an increase or decrease in the market value of our marketable securities 
if we liquidate any of our marketable securities prior to the time of their maturity  we could receive less than the face value of the security
