item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under certain factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview revenues 
we generate revenues principally from licensing our intelligent management software products and providing related services  including maintenance and technical support  consulting and training 
our software license revenues consist of perpetual and term license sales of our software products 
our service revenues consist of fees from maintenance and technical support agreements  consulting services and training 
the maintenance agreements covering our products provide for technical support and periodic unspecified product upgrades 
in july  we changed our business practice to allow our customers to separately purchase periodic unspecified product upgrades without purchasing technical support 
revenue related to periodic unspecified product upgrades is now included in license revenue 
revenue related to technical support is included in service revenue 
license revenue from unspecified product upgrades was approximately million in fiscal we offer consulting services  generally under fixed price agreements  primarily to provide product customization and enhancements 
we provide classroom and on site training to our customers on a daily fee basis 
revenues from sales outside of the united states represented   and of our total revenues in fiscal   and  respectively 
in fiscal  sales outside the united states were primarily made through our paris  france and oxen  united kingdom offices as well as third party distributors and value added resellers  who are generally responsible for providing technical support and service to customers within their territory 
we expect revenues from sales outside the united states to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues in the future 
we believe that continued growth and profitability will require further expansion of our sales  marketing and customer service functions in international markets 
we expect to commit additional time and development resources to customizing our products and services for selected international markets 
cadence royalty agreement 
in march  we entered into a two year non renewable agreement with cadence design systems cadence  that required us to make an aggregate payment of million to cadence and to pay a royalty on specified sales of opnet modeler products sold to the portion of cadence s customer base that used an existing cadence product 
this agreement expired in march for fiscal and  cadence royalties were  and  respectively 
we amortized the million payment over the two year marketing support period as part of sales and marketing expenses  and charged the royalty payments to cost of software license revenues as the related revenue was recognized 
netmaker acquisition 
in march  we acquired the netmaker division of make systems  inc netmaker for consideration of million and  shares of our common stock 
netmaker offered a sophisticated suite of products that address the operational and engineering needs of traditional and next generation network service providers 
the acquisition contributed key components that enabled us to broaden our product suite for the service provider market 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our acquisition of netmaker 
wdm netdesign acquisition 
in july  we acquired a interest in wdm netdesign bvba wdm netdesign for consideration of  and purchased an option for consideration of  to acquire all remaining shares of wdm netdesign 
through this acquisition  we collaborated on the development of optical network planning products with comsof nv  the owner of wdm netdesign 
in december  we exercised our option to purchase the remaining shares of wdm netdesign for approximately million 
in january  we purchased these shares by paying comsof nv  and issuing them  shares of our common stock 
as a result of this acquisition  we now own wdm netdesign s core technology in optical networking design and engineering depth and expertise 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our acquisition of wdm netdesign 
results of operations the following table sets forth items from our statements of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended march  revenues software licenses services total revenues cost of revenues software licenses services total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of acquired intangibles 
purchased research and development total operating expenses income from operations interest and other income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income the following table sets forth  for each component of revenues  the cost of these revenues as a percentage of the related revenues for the periods indicated year ended march  cost of software license revenues cost of service revenues revenues software license revenues 
software license revenues were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of in fiscal from fiscal and in fiscal from fiscal this growth is primarily due to increased overall demand for our products  revenue contribution from new products  increased penetration of international markets  expansion of marketing and direct sales force and increased average transaction size 
approximately million of the increase in fiscal was due to the change in business practice in july to allow customers to separately purchase unspecified product upgrades without purchasing technical support 
for fiscal  a substantial growth in sales to enterprises of opnet it guru  application characterization environment  and new modules  such as ace decode module  netdoctor and flow analysis  combined with sales to service providers of two products launched in fiscal  opnet sp guru and opnet wdm guru  offset a significant decline in sales to network equipment manufacturers of opnet modeler 
the increase in demand for our products during fiscal was primarily for opnet modeler  opnet netbiz  opnet it guru and application characterization environment 
we may experience a slower rate of growth in overall software license revenues in the near term due to potentially lower spending levels by enterprise it organizations  service providers and network equipment manufacturers as a result of a challenging economy 
service revenues 
service revenues were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of in fiscal from fiscal and in fiscal from fiscal the increases in service revenues are primarily due to growing demand for our consulting services  increased renewals for maintenance contracts by our installed base of customers  and additional technical support contracts related to new license sales 
for fiscal  these increases were partially offset by our change in business practices in july to allow customers to purchase unspecified periodic product upgrades license revenue and technical support service revenue separately 
engagements with us government agencies and customization of our opnet netbiz product contributed to the growing demand for our consulting services in fiscal and  respectively 
we expect that service revenues will continue to increase in absolute dollars as long as our customer base continues to grow and we maintain several large consulting contracts with us government agencies 
cost of revenues cost of software license revenues consists primarily of royalties  media  manuals  and distribution costs 
cost of service revenues consists primarily of personnel related costs in providing maintenance and technical support  consulting and training to customers 
gross margin on software license revenues is substantially higher than gross margin on service revenues  due to the low materials  packaging and other costs of software products compared with the relatively high personnel costs associated with providing services 
cost of software license revenues 
cost of software license revenues were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal is primarily due to an increase in royalty costs for licensing agreements entered into since march  partially offset by the decrease in royalty payments under our march agreement with cadence  which expired in march the decrease in fiscal from fiscal results from a reduction in the number of sales requiring royalty payments under our agreement with cadence 
cost of service revenues 
cost of service revenues were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of in fiscal from fiscal and in fiscal from fiscal gross margin on service revenues increased slightly to in fiscal from in fiscal due to a higher level of profitability in consulting and training services and an increased volume of maintenance services  which provide higher gross margins than consulting and training services  as the maintenance services are less labor intensive 
gross margin on service revenue decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to a slightly higher proportion of service revenues derived from consulting services  which provide lower gross margins than maintenance services 
we expect cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues to vary based primarily on the profitability of individual consulting engagements 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of in fiscal from fiscal and in fiscal from fiscal these increases are primarily due to increased headcount as a result of the netmaker acquisition in march and the wdm netdesign acquisition in january  and increased staffing levels for developing new products as well as sustaining and upgrading existing products 
the increase in fiscal was partially offset by a decrease in discretionary bonuses for fiscal compared to fiscal we believe that a significant level of research and development investment will be required to maintain our competitive position and broaden our product lines  as well as enhance the features and functionality of our current products 
we expect the absolute dollar amount of these expenditures will continue to grow but generally decrease as a percentage of total revenues in future periods 
our ability to decrease these expenses as a percentage of revenue will depend upon our revenue growth  among other factors 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal is primarily due to an increase in the size of our direct sales force  including the addition of sales offices in the united kingdom and australia in fiscal  increased commissions associated with the growth in revenues and higher conference costs 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal is primarily due to a substantial increase in the size of our direct sales force  increased commissions associated with the growth in revenues and higher marketing costs 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease resulted from a proportionally smaller increase in costs associated with developing market awareness for our new products relative to the higher level of revenues in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal from in fiscal the increase as a percentage of total revenues was due to our additional investment of resources associated with developing market awareness for our opnet it guru and opnet netbiz products in fiscal we anticipate that we will continue to commit substantial resources to sales and marketing in the future and that sales and marketing expenses may increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue in future periods 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal is primarily due to higher legal  accounting and other professional fees  bad debt expense and personnel costs 
the increase in fiscal was partially offset by a decrease in discretionary bonuses for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal from fiscal is primarily due to additional personnel costs and other expenses associated with our expansion of supporting infrastructure 
we expect the dollar amount of general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to expand our operations but generally decrease as a percentage of total revenues in future periods 
our ability to decrease these expenses as a percentage of revenues will depend upon our revenue growth  among other factors 
amortization of acquired technology 
in connection with our acquisitions of netmaker in march and wdm netdesign in january  we recorded acquired technology of million 
beginning in fiscal  these acquired technologies are being amortized on a straight line basis over five years 
amortization of acquired technology was  in fiscal purchased in process research and development 
in connection with the netmaker acquisition  we obtained an independent valuation to determine the fair value of the net assets acquired and to allocate the purchase price 
as a result of the purchase price allocation  we recorded an expense of  in the fourth quarter of fiscal representing the write off of the fair value of acquired in process research and development that had not reached technological feasibility nor had any alternative future use 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net were million  million and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease of million in fiscal from fiscal is primarily due to a reduction in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents due to the decline in interest rates throughout fiscal the increase of million in fiscal from fiscal is primarily attributable to the interest earned on the proceeds from our initial public offering 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rates were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate and varies from period to period due principally to growth in operating income and the amount of tax credits available to us in each period from incremental research expenditures 
in fiscal  we conducted a review of our costs to determine their qualification for the increased research tax credit 
as a result of this review  we generated an additional  in non recurring tax credits resulting from incremental research expenditures 
we expect our effective tax rate in the near term to range from to  however  future provisions for taxes will depend  among other things  on the mix and amount of worldwide income  the tax rates in effect for various tax jurisdictions and the amount of increased research tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through cash provided by operating activities and through the sale of equity securities 
in august  we completed our initial public offering in which we raised approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses payable by us 
as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities is primarily derived from net income  as adjusted for depreciation and amortization and increases in deferred revenue  changes in accrued liabilities and increases in accounts receivable balances 
the decrease in cash provided by operations in fiscal from fiscal was attributable to our decreased accrued liabilities  resulting from a decrease in accrued bonus compensation  increased billed accounts receivable due to our revenue growth  and increased refundable income taxes  due to non recurring tax credits for incremental research expenditures 
cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the funds were used to purchase property and equipment for our corporate headquarters in bethesda  maryland and expenditures for purchased software 
cash used in investing activities also includes the cash portion of the purchase price of the netmaker acquisition in march and the purchase of wdm netdesign  net of cash acquired  in january in fiscal and fiscal  these funds were also used to purchase marketing support rights from cadence 
cash provided by financing activities was  million  and  for fiscal   and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities reflects the proceeds received from the exercise of stock options  the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan  the issuance of a note payable in fiscal  and the proceeds received in fiscal from our initial public offering  net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses 
we have a million revolving line of credit with a commercial bank  which expires in june borrowings under this line of credit bear interest at an annual rate equal to libor plus to 
we have currently used million of this facility for a letter of credit that secures the lease for our headquarters in bethesda  maryland 
there was no balance outstanding on this line of credit as of march  we plan to renew the line of credit upon its expiration in june as of march   we did not have any significant contractual commitments other than operating leases for office facilities 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for information related to our operating leases 
we expect working capital needs to increase in the foreseeable future in order for us to execute our business plan 
we anticipate that operating activities  as well as planned capital expenditures  will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or products 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations  along with available borrowings under our line of credit  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to utilize accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts 
future results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be both important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the exercise of significant  subjective  or complex judgment and or estimates 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts and the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
for our software arrangements  a determination needs to be made for each arrangement regarding whether the percentage of completion contract accounting method should be used to recognize revenue or whether revenue can be recognized when the software is delivered and all of the conditions of sop are met 
contract accounting is required if our services are essential to the arrangement 
in many cases  our services are essential to the arrangement because they involve customization and enhancements  and our fees are paid in stages based upon the completion of defined service deliverables 
as a result  we typically recognize revenue from these arrangements using contract accounting  which generally results in recording revenue over a longer period of time 
in other cases  our services are not essential to the arrangement and the realization of our license fee is not dependent on the completion of such services 
in these situations  we recognize software license revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable  which generally results in recording revenue earlier than when contract accounting is used 
the determination of whether our services are essential involves significant judgment and could have a material impact on our results of operations from period to period to the extent that significant new arrangements are not accounted for using contract accounting 
under the percentage of completion contract accounting method  we recognize revenue from the entire arrangement based on the percentage of hours incurred related to our services compared to the total hours of such services 
using the percentage of completion method requires us to make estimates about the future cost of services and estimated hours to complete  which are subject to change for a variety of internal and external factors 
a change in these estimates could result in a material adjustment to the amount of revenue recorded in any period under the arrangement 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and for the limited circumstances when the customer disputes the amounts due us 
our methodology for determining this allowance requires significant estimates 
in estimating the allowance  management considers the age of the receivable  the creditworthiness of the customer  the economic conditions of the customer s industry and general economic conditions 
while we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable  should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could impact the amount of our future allowance for doubtful accounts as well as future operating income 
specifically  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments to us  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill 
we account for our goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our intangible assets consist of acquired technology 
they are recorded at cost and amortized on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives of five years 
we use the projected discounted cash flow method in valuing our acquired technology  using certain assumptions including revenue growth  cost levels  present value discount rate and working capital requirements 
while we believe the assumptions used are reasonable  actual results will more likely than not differ from those assumptions 
future cash flows are subject to change for a variety of internal and external factors 
we will periodically review the value of acquired technology for reasonableness 
changes in our assumptions at the time of future periodic reviews could result in impairment losses 
goodwill is recorded when the consideration paid for acquisitions exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized 
we perform an annual review during our fourth quarter to identify any facts or circumstances that indicate the carrying value of goodwill is impaired 
the review is based on various analyses including cash flow and profitability projections and the market capitalization of our common stock 
impairment  if any  is based on the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its fair value 
no impairment has been indicated to date 
accounting for software development costs 
costs incurred in the research and development of new software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is established 
development costs are capitalized beginning when a product s technological feasibility has been established and ending when the product is available for general release to our customers 
technological feasibility is reached when the product reaches the working model stage 
to date  products and enhancements have generally reached technological feasibility and have been released for sale at substantially the same time and all research and development costs have been expensed 
consequently  no research and development costs were capitalized in fiscal certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of factors outside of our control  which could cause the market price of our stock to decline our operating results have fluctuated in the past  and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future 
our financial results may as a consequence fall short of the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
factors that could affect our operating results include 
the timing of large orders  
software arrangements requiring contract accounting  
changes in the mix of our sales  including the mix between higher margin software products and somewhat lower margin services and maintenance  and the proportion of our license sales requiring us to make royalty payments  
the timing and amount of our marketing  sales  and product development expenses  
the cost and time required to develop new software products  
the introduction  timing  and market acceptance of new products introduced by us or our competitors  
changes in network technology or in applications  which could require us to modify our products or develop new products  
general economic conditions  which can affect our customers purchasing decisions and the length of our sales cycle  
changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  and 
the timing and size of potential acquisitions by us 
we expect to make significant expenditures in all areas of our business  particularly sales and marketing operations  in order to promote future growth 
because the expenses associated with these activities are relatively fixed in the short term  we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected shortfall in revenue growth or any decrease in revenue levels 
in addition  our revenues in any quarter depend substantially on orders we receive and ship in that quarter 
we typically receive a significant portion of orders in any quarter during the last month of the quarter  and we cannot predict whether those orders will be placed and shipped in that period 
if we have lower revenues than we expect  we probably will not be able to reduce our operating expenses quickly in response 
therefore  any significant shortfall in revenues or delay of customer orders could have an immediate adverse effect on our operating results in that quarter 
for all of these reasons  quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on them as an indication of our future performance 
the market for intelligent network management software is new and evolving  and if this market does not develop as anticipated  our revenues could decline we derive all of our revenues from the sale of products and services that are designed to allow our customers to manage the performance of networks and applications 
accordingly  if the market for intelligent network management software does not continue to grow  we could face declining revenues  which could ultimately lead to our becoming unprofitable 
the market for intelligent network management software solutions is in an early stage of development 
therefore  we cannot accurately assess the size of the market and may be unable to identify an effective distribution strategy  the competitive environment that will develop  and the appropriate features and prices for products to address the market 
if we are to be successful  our current and potential customers must recognize the value of intelligent network management software solutions  decide to invest in the management of their networks  and  in particular  adopt and continue to use our software solutions 
our customers are primarily in four target markets and our operating results may be adversely affected by changes in one or more of these markets as part of our focus on four targeted markets  our financial results depend  in significant part  upon the economic conditions of enterprise  us government agencies  service provider and network equipment manufacturer markets 
an economic downturn or adverse change in the regulatory environment or business prospects for one or more of these markets may decrease our revenues or lower our growth rate 
a decline in information technology spending may result in a decrease in our revenues or lower our growth rate a decline in the demand for information technology among our current and prospective customers may result in decreased revenues or a lower growth rate for us because our sales depend  in part  on our customers level of funding for new or additional information technology systems and services 
a continued economic downturn may cause our customers to reduce or eliminate information technology spending and cause price erosion for our solutions  which would substantially reduce the number of new software licenses we sell and the average sales price for these licenses 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues 
if our newest products  particularly those targeted primarily for enterprises  do not gain widespread market acceptance  our revenues might not increase and could even decline we expect to derive a substantial portion of our revenues in the future from sales to enterprises of version of opnet it guru  which was released in may  application characterization environment  which was released in fiscal  products released in fiscal  such as ace decode module  netdoctor and flow analysis  and opnet vne server  which is expected to be released in june our business depends on customer acceptance of these products and our revenues may not increase  or may decline  if our target customers do not adopt and expand their use of our products 
to date  we have not achieved widespread market acceptance of our products 
in addition  if our opnet modeler product  which we have been selling since  continues to encounter declining sales  which could occur for a variety of reasons  including market saturation and the financial condition of network equipment manufacturers  and sales of our newer products do not grow at a rate sufficient to offset the shortfall  our revenues would decline 
we may not be able to grow our business if service providers do not buy our products a key element of our strategy is to increase sales to service providers  and our future performance will be significantly dependent upon increased adoption by service providers of our software products  including opnetsp guru and opnet wdm guru  both launched in fiscal accordingly  if our products fail to perform favorably in the service provider environment or to gain wider adoption by service providers  our business and future operating results could suffer 
our lengthy and variable sales cycle makes it difficult to predict operating results it is difficult for us to forecast the timing and recognition of revenues from sales of our products because prospective customers often take significant time evaluating our products before licensing them 
the period between initial customer contact and a purchase by a customer may vary from three months to more than a year 
during the sales process  the customer may decide not to purchase or may scale down proposed orders of our products for various reasons  including changes in budgets and purchasing priorities 
our prospective customers routinely require education regarding the use and benefit of our products 
this may also lead to delays in receiving customers orders 
if we do not successfully expand our sales force  we may be unable to increase our sales we sell our products primarily through our direct sales force  and we must expand the size of our sales force to increase revenues 
if we are unable to hire or retain qualified sales personnel  if newly hired personnel fail to develop the necessary skills to be productive  or if they reach productivity more slowly than anticipated  our ability to increase our revenues and grow our business could be compromised 
our sales people require a long period of time to become productive  typically three to six months 
the time required to reach productivity  as well as the challenge of attracting  training  and retaining qualified candidates  may make it difficult to meet our sales force growth targets 
further  we may not generate sufficient sales to offset the increased expense resulting from growing our sales force or we may be unable to manage a larger sales force 
our ability to increase our sales will be impaired if we do not expand and manage our indirect distribution channels to increase our sales  we must  among other things  further expand and manage our indirect distribution channels  which consist primarily of international distributors and original equipment manufacturers and resellers 
if we are unable to expand and manage our relationships with our distributors  our distributors are unable or unwilling to effectively market and sell our products  or we lose existing distributor relationships  we might not be able to increase our revenues 
our international distributors and original equipment manufacturers and resellers have no obligation to market or purchase our products 
in addition  they could partner with our competitors  bundle or resell competitors products  or internally develop products that compete with our products 
we may not be able to successfully manage our expanding operations  which could impair our ability to operate profitably we may be unable to operate our business profitably if we fail to manage our growth 
our rapid growth has sometimes strained  and may in the future continue to strain  our managerial  administrative  operational  and financial resources and controls 
we plan to continue to expand our operations and increase the number of our full time employees 
our ability to manage growth will depend in part on our ability to continue to enhance our operating  financial  and management information systems 
our personnel  systems  and controls may not be adequate to support our growth 
in addition  our revenues may not continue to grow at a sufficient rate to absorb the costs associated with a larger overall employee base 
if we are unable to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that respond effectively to changing technology  our revenues may decline our market is characterized by rapid technological change  changes in customer requirements  frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements  and evolving industry standards 
if we fail to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that respond to these changes  our products could become obsolete  demand for our products could decline and our revenues could fall 
advances in network management technology  software engineering  simulation technology  or the emergence of new industry standards  could lead to new competitive products that have better performance  more features  or lower prices than our products and could render our products unmarketable 
in addition  the introduction and adoption of future network technologies or application architectures could reduce or eliminate the need for predictive network management software 
our future revenue is substantially dependent upon our installed customer base continuing to license additional products  renew maintenance agreements and purchase additional services our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional revenue from consulting services  renewed maintenance agreements and license of other products 
the maintenance agreements are generally renewable at the option of the customers and there are no mandatory payment obligations or obligations to license additional software 
in addition  customers may decide not to purchase additional products or services 
if our customers fail to renew their maintenance agreements or purchase additional products or services  our revenues could decrease 
increases in service revenues as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins and adversely affect our operating results we realize lower margins on service revenues than on software license revenues 
as a result  if service revenues increase as a percentage of total revenues  our gross margins will be lower and our operating results may be adversely affected 
if we fail to retain our key personnel and attract and retain additional qualified personnel  we might not be able to sustain our revenue growth our future success and our ability to sustain our revenue growth depend upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key sales and research and development personnel 
the loss of any of our key employees  in particular marc a 
cohen  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and alain j 
cohen  our president and chief technology officer  could adversely affect our ability to pursue our growth strategy 
we do not have employment agreements or any other agreements that obligate any of our officers or key employees to remain with us 
we must also continue to hire large numbers of highly qualified individuals  particularly software engineers and sales and marketing personnel 
our failure to attract and retain technical personnel for our product development  consulting services  and technical support teams may limit our ability to develop new products or product enhancements 
competition for these individuals is intense  and we may not be able to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future 
in addition  limitations imposed by federal immigration laws and the availability of visas could impair our ability to recruit and employ skilled technical professionals from other countries to work in the united states 
our international operations subject our business to additional risks  which could cause our sales or profitability to decline we plan to increase our international sales activities  but these plans are subject to a number of risks that could cause our sales to decline or could otherwise cause a decline in profitability 
these risks include 
difficulty in attracting distributors that will market and support our products effectively  
greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  
the need to comply with varying employment policies and regulations that could make it more difficult and expensive to manage our employees if we need to establish more direct sales or support staff outside the united states  
potentially adverse tax consequences  
the effects of currency fluctuations  and 
political and economic instability 
we expect to face intense competition  which could cause us to lose sales  resulting in lower profitability increasing competition in our market could cause us to lose sales and become unprofitable 
the market for intelligent network management software is evolving rapidly and is highly competitive 
we believe that this market is likely to become more competitive as the demand for intelligent network management solutions continues to increase 
many of our current and potential competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources than we do 
in addition  it is possible that other vendors as well as some of our customers or distributors will develop and market solutions that compete with our products in the future 
if our products contain errors and we are unable to correct those errors our reputation could be harmed and could cause our customers to demand refunds from us or assert claims for damages against us our software products could contain significant errors or bugs that may result in 
the loss of or delay in market acceptance and sales of our products  
the delay in introduction of new products  
diversion of our resources  
injury to our reputation  and 
increased support costs 
bugs may be discovered at any point in a product s life cycle 
we expect that errors in our products will be found in the future  particularly in new product offerings and new releases of our current products 
because our customers use our products to manage networks that are critical to their business operations  any failure of our products could expose us to product liability claims 
in addition  errors in our products could cause our customers networks and systems to fail or compromise their data  which could also result in liability to us 
product liability claims brought against us could divert the attention of management and key personnel  could be expensive to defend  and may result in adverse settlements and judgments 
our software products rely on our intellectual property  and any failure to protect our intellectual property could enable our competitors to market products with similar features that may reduce our revenues and could allow the use of our products by users who have not paid the required license fee if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  our competitors could use our intellectual property to market products similar to our products  which could reduce our revenues 
in addition  we may be unable to prevent the use of our products by persons who have not paid the required license fee  which could reduce our revenues 
our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon the internally developed technology that is incorporated in our products 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as those in the united states 
others may circumvent the patents  copyrights  and trade secrets we own 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into a combination of confidentiality  non competition and non disclosure agreements with our employees 
these measures afford only limited protection and may be inadequate  especially because our employees are highly sought after and may leave our employ with significant knowledge of our proprietary information 
in addition  any confidentiality  non competition and non disclosure agreements we enter into may be found to be unenforceable  or our copy protection mechanisms embedded in our software products could fail or could be circumvented 
our products employ technology that may infringe on the proprietary rights of others  and  as a result  we could become liable for significant damages we expect that our software products may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionalities of products in different industry segments overlap 
regardless of whether these claims have any merit  they could 
be time consuming to defend  
result in costly litigation  
divert our management s attention and resources  
cause us to cease or delay product shipments  or 
require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
these royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
a successful claim of product infringement against us or our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could adversely affect our business because we would not be able to sell the affected product without redeveloping it or incurring significant additional expense 
possible adverse impact of interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements based on our reading and interpretations of sops  and  and sab  we believe that our current contract terms and business arrangements have been properly reported 
however  the american institute of certified public accountants and its software revenue recognition task force continue to issue interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range of sales contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the software industry 
future interpretations of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in future changes in our revenue recognition accounting policies that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as with other software vendors  we may be required to delay revenue recognition into future periods which could adversely impact our operating results we have in the past had to  and in the future may have to  defer recognition for license fees due to several factors  including whether 
software arrangements include undelivered elements for which we do not have vendor specific evidence of fair value  
we must deliver services for significant customization  enhancements and modifications of our software  
the transaction involves material acceptance criteria or there are other identified product related issues  
the transaction involves contingent payment terms or fees  
we are required to accept a fixed fee services contract  or 
we are required to accept extended payment terms 
because of the factors listed above and other specific requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states for software revenue recognition  we must have very precise terms in our software arrangements in order to recognize revenue when we initially deliver software or perform services 
negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend the sales cycle  and sometimes we do not obtain terms and conditions that permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery 
if we undertake acquisitions  they may be expensive and disruptive to our business and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline in march  we completed the netmaker acquisition 
we may continue to acquire or make investments in companies  products or technologies if opportunities arise 
any acquisition could be expensive  disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  and adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates  and if we do identify suitable candidates  we may not be able to make these acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
if we make an acquisition  we could have difficulty integrating the acquired technology  employees  or operations 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
we also expect that we would incur substantial expenses if we acquired other businesses or technologies 
we might use cash on hand  incur debt  or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
if we issue additional equity securities  our stockholders could experience dilution and the market price of our stock may decline 
our products are subject to changing computing environments  including operating system software and hardware platforms  which could render our products obsolete the evolution of existing computing environments and the introduction of new popular computing environments may require us to redesign our products or develop new products 
computing environments  including operating system software and hardware platforms  are complex and change rapidly 
our products are designed to operate in currently popular computing environments 
due to the long development and testing periods required to adapt our products to new or modified computing environments  we could experience significant delays in product releases or shipments  which could result in lost revenues and significant additional expense 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents  and those with maturities greater than three months are considered to be marketable securities 
cash equivalents and marketable securities are stated at amortized cost plus accrued interest  which approximates fair value 
cash equivalents consist primarily of money instruments and us treasury bills 
the carrying value of our note payable approximates fair value 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure  but do not believe that an increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the value of our cash equivalents  marketable securities or note payable
