overview we design and sell field programmable gate arrays  embedded standard products  associated software and programming hardware 
from our inception in april through the third quarter of  we were primarily engaged in product development 
in  we introduced our first line of field programmable gate array products  or fpgas  based upon our vialink technology 
fpgas have accounted for substantially all of our product revenue to date 
we currently have four fpga product families pasic  introduced in  pasic  introduced in  and pasic  introduced in we introduced our eclipse family of fpgas in the newer product families generally contain greater logic capacity  but do not necessarily replace sales of older generation products 
in september  we introduced quickram  our first line of embedded standard products  or esps 
our esps are based on our fpga technology 
in april  we introduced quickpci  our second line of esps 
revenue for our quickram and quickpci products together accounted for approximately of our total revenue in during  we introduced the quickfc  quickdsp  quicksd and quickmips families of esps  which accounted for about of total revenue in we also license our quickworks and quicktools design software and sell our programming hardware  which together have typically accounted for less than of total revenue 
in april  we signed a definitive agreement with v semiconductor  inc to acquire certain assets of v in a stock transaction 
we also entered into a manufacturing and distribution agreement with v pending the sale in order to ensure continued distribution of v s products to its customers 
v  based in toronto  ontario  manufactured application specific standard products  or assps  that enhance high speed data throughput within telecommunications and internet infrastructure systems 
to facilitate the asset sale and the subsequent windup of v as a distinct entity  v filed for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy laws in may in august  we completed the acquisition of certain assets of v  for approximately million shares of our common stock  valued at million 
the acquisition is designed to accelerate our esp strategy by strengthening our ability to develop and market system level products for the communications and networking markets 
upon completion of v s bankruptcy proceedings  v is expected to distribute these shares to its creditors and stockholders 
the distributed shares will then be freely tradeable on the open market 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
on december   we entered into a share purchase agreement the agreement with tower semiconductor ltd 
tower 
under the agreement  we agreed to make a million strategic investment in tower as part of tower s plan to build a new wafer fabrication facility 
the new fabrication facility will produce mm wafers in geometries of micron and below  using advanced cmos technology from toshiba 
in return for the investment  we will receive equity and committed production capacity in the advanced fabrication facility that tower is building 
in connection with the agreement  we also entered into a foundry agreement under which we are entitled to a certain amount of wafer purchase credits 
up to of order value can be applied against these credits in future wafer purchases from tower 
the amount of credits is determined upon each share purchase transaction and is calculated based on the difference between our share purchase exercise price and the higher of and tower s average stock price for days preceding a purchase transaction 
under the terms of the agreement  our investment will be made in several stages over an approximately month period  against satisfactory completion of key milestones for the construction  equipping and commencement of production at the new wafer fabrication facility 
pursuant to the agreement  we purchased  ordinary shares of tower and future wafer purchase credits for an aggregate purchase price of million in fiscal we agreed to purchase an additional  ordinary shares of tower in three equal increments upon occurrence of certain events relating to the construction of the fabrication facility 
we agreed to purchase two thirds of these additional shares in fiscal  and the remainder in the ordinary shares are restricted  and we account for the shares under the cost method  based on the fact that we do not have significant influence over tower s operations 
during the third quarter of fiscal  due to an other than temporary decline in the value of the stock  we wrote down our investment in tower  recording a pre tax  non operating loss of million 
also  in october  approximately million of our wafer purchase credits were converted to  ordinary shares in tower 
at december   the wafer credits from tower totalled million and are included in other assets on the balance sheet 
at december   we owned a total of  shares in tower  with a book value of million 
we sell our products through two channels 
we sell the majority of our products through distributors who have contractual rights to earn a negotiated margin on the sale of our products 
we refer to these distributors as point of sale distributors 
we defer recognition of revenue for sales of unprogrammed products to these point of sale distributors until after they have sold these products to systems manufacturers 
we recognize revenue on programmed products at the time of shipment 
approximately of our products sold by point of sale distributors are programmed by us and are not returnable by these point of sale distributors 
we also sell our products directly to systems manufacturers and recognize revenue at the time of shipment 
the percentage of sales derived through each of these channels in was and respectively 
in it was and  respectively  and and in  respectively 
four distributors accounted for    and of sales  respectively  in five distributors accounted for    and of sales  respectively  in and five distributors accounted for approximately    and of sales  respectively  in we expect that a limited number of distributors will continue to account for a significant portion of our total sales 
we believe the company s products are proprietary and sole source  and that the loss of a particular distributor would not result in a short term disruption in sales of our products  since our customers would either buy our products from another distributor or directly from us 
our international sales were  and of our total sales for  and  respectively 
we expect that revenue derived from sales to international customers will continue to represent a significant and growing portion of our total revenue 
all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
average selling prices for our products typically decline rapidly during the first six to months after their introduction  then decline less rapidly as the products mature 
we attempt to maintain gross margins even as average selling prices decline through the introduction of new products with higher margins and through manufacturing efficiencies and cost reductions 
however  the markets in which we operate are highly competitive  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully maintain gross margins 
any significant decline in our gross margins will materially harm our business 
we outsource the wafer manufacturing  assembly and test of all of our products 
we rely upon taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company and cypress semiconductor corporation to manufacture our products  and we rely primarily upon amkor technology and chippac  inc to assemble and test our products 
under our arrangements with cypress  we are obligated to provide forecasts and enter into binding obligations for anticipated purchases 
this limits our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products  which could lead to excesses or shortages of wafers for a particular product 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of revenue for certain items in our statements of operations for the periods indicated years ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring costs net operating income interest expense interest income and other  net net income years ended december   and revenue 
our revenue for  and was million  million and million  respectively  representing growth of from to and a decrease of from to the majority of the increase in revenue  as compared with  was due to growth in sales of our fpga products  which increased by  or million 
our esp products also increased from to by million or 
from to  our sales of fpgas declined by  or million  in line with other competitors in the industry 
sales of our esp products  however  increased by  or million  driven mostly by the acquisition of v gross profit 
gross profit was million  million and million in  and  respectively  which was  and of revenue for those periods 
the increase in  as compared with  was primarily due to the continued growth in sales and the introduction of higher margin quickram products 
the increase was partially offset by a slight decrease in the average selling price of the older pasic and pasic product families 
the decline in gross margin from to was due to relatively fixed manufacturing overhead costs allocated over lower direct manufacturing costs associated with lower revenue  a write off of approximately million in excess die inventory and a small increase in direct manufacturing costs as a percentage of revenue 
we expect that as our manufacturing volumes return to historical levels  our gross profit percentage should also return to the range 
research and development expense 
research and development expense was million  million and million in  and respectively  which was  and of revenue for those periods 
the increases in research and development spending from to was due primarily to an increase in the number of employees involved in research and development as we accelerated the introduction of new products  particularly our esp s 
in  we added research and development centers in toronto formerly v and bangalore  india 
the remainder of the increase for was due to increased spending to accelerate the introduction of our quickmips family of products 
we believe that continued investments in process technology and product development are essential for us to remain competitive in the markets we serve 
specifically in regard to our esps  we expect to continue to increase research and development spending 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively  which was  and of revenue for those periods 
the increases in and were primarily due to hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel and increased sales commissions 
we kept these expenses relatively flat from to  but they rose as a percentage of revenue due to the decrease in revenue for the period 
we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expense will not continue to decrease  but remain relatively flat or increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our business and seek to find new customers for our products 
in october  we reduced our worldwide headcount by approximately 
we also instituted salary reduction plans for salaried employees of to 
we wrote off  of intellectual property associated with a cancelled product and incurred  in severance and other related costs 
these charges were reflected in our fourth quarter results as a restructuring charge of  deferred compensation 
with respect to the grant of stock options to employees  we recorded aggregate deferred compensation of  in there was no deferred compensation recorded in or the amount of deferred compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and amortized ratably over the vesting period of the applicable options  generally four years 
we amortized   and  in  and  respectively 
the amortization of deferred compensation is recorded as research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses  depending on the related employees activities 
write down of marketable securities 
during the third quarter of  we wrote down the value of our investment in tower semiconductor ltd 
to market value 
this resulted in a charge to income of million 
we have invested million in tower common stock associated with their fab  deep sub micron wafer foundry project 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net of expense  was   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase from to in interest income was due mainly to our investment of proceeds from the october initial public offering and april follow on offering 
interest and other income decreased in due to decreased cash balances and lower interest rates 
provision for income taxes no provision for income taxes was recorded for the years ended december   and  as we were able to utilize a portion of our state and federal net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
these carryforwards  if not utilized to offset future taxable income and income taxes payable  will continue to expire through liquidity and capital resources at december  we had million in cash  a decrease of million from cash held at december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have an equipment financing line with a commercial bank 
at december   we had obligations of  outstanding under this equipment line with no remaining available balance 
the outstanding obligations under the equipment line are due over the next one to three years 
the interest rate on these borrowings is at the bank s prime interest rate plus 
net cash provided by used for operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  we paid our remaining obligations to actel from a cross licensing agreement 
net income and an increase in accounts payable were the primary sources of operating cashflow in net income  offset by an increase in depreciation was the primary source of operating cashflow in these increases were partially offset by increases in inventories and prepaid expenses 
in  our primary use of cash was an operating loss  which was offset by an increase in depreciation  a non cash writedown of tower securities  and a decrease in receivables 
net cash used for investing activities was million  million  and million  respectively 
all of this amount in and was used for acquisition of property and equipment 
in  million was used for acquisition of property and equipment 
of the remaining million  million was used for our investment in tower 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million  and million in   and  respectiviely 
in and the primary source of cash was our initial public offering and our follow on offering 
cash was used to repay bank debt of million and  in and  respectively 
in  the main source of cash was million received from the exercise of stock options  which was offset by  used to repay bank debt 
we require substantial working capital to fund our business  particularly to finance inventories and accounts receivable 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of sales growth  market acceptance of our existing and new products  the amount and timing of research and development expenditures  the timing of the introduction of new products and expansion of sales and marketing efforts 
there can be no assurance that additional equity or debt financing  if required  will be available on satisfactory terms 
we believe the net proceeds of our offerings combined with existing capital resources and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our needs for operating cashflow and our commitment to invest in tower over the next months  although we could seek to raise additional capital during that period 
after the next months  our capital and operating requirements will depend on many factors  including the levels at which we maintain inventory and accounts receivable  costs of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity and increases in our operating expenses 
inflation the impact of inflation on our business has not been material for the fiscal years ended december   and critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  estimating accrued liabilities and allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue from two sources the selling of fpga s and esp products  and the sale of software licenses for our design tools 
software sales historically represent less than of our total revenues 
in both cases  management judgements and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
our fpgas and esps may be programmed by us  our distributors  or the end customers 
we sell to our distributors under agreements which  in the case of unprogrammed parts  allow certain rights of return and price adjustments on unsold inventory 
amounts billed to such distributors for shipments are included as accounts receivable  inventory is relieved  and the related revenue and cost of revenue are deferred 
revenue is not recognized until the inventory is resold by the distributor 
revenue for programmed parts  which do not have similar return rights  as well as for all non distributor customers is recognized upon shipment 
we estimate returns and distributor price adjustments and provide reserves against accounts receivable 
in all cases  we assess whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
software revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of agreement exists  delivery of the software has occurred  no significant obligations with regard to implementation or integration exist  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
because our software sales typically do not include any undelivered elements  and do not require support or maintenance  revenue from software sales is generally recognized at the time of delivery 
in order to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the recognition of revenue at the time until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
estimating accrued liabilities and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  we must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of returns reserves 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
the provision for returns amounted to  in similarly  our management estimates the collectability of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of december  inventory valuation 
we value our inventory at the lower of standard cost or net realizable value 
standard cost approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis 
we routinely evaluate the levels of our inventory in light of current market conditions and market trends 
during  demand for our products declined precipitously and our arrangements with our suppliers caused us to purchase more inventory than we required 
during the second quarter of we established additional reserves for this excess inventory 
these reserves are associated with specific inventory items and will be relieved when the specific inventory is scrapped or sold 
market conditions are subject to change and forecast demand always differs from actual demand 
such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the lives of our products are unusually long and obsolescence has not been a significant factor in the valuation of our inventories 
we also evaluate our inventory in light of its merchantability 
accordingly  we create reserves for inventory returned from our customers that has not been processed for resale and for new products that have not been qualified for shipment to our customers 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
during the third quarter of  quicklogic wrote down the value of its equity investment in tower 
the tower shares were purchased at an average price of per share 
quicklogic has reduced the carrying value for this asset to per share  based on the market price of tower s common stock at the end of the third quarter  the total amount of the write down was million 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to million as of december  recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations 
all business combinations in the scope of this statement are to be accounted for using only the purchase method 
the provisions of this statement apply to all business combinations initiated after june  as such  we have applied sfas no 
in our acquisition of v in august also in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we do not believe the application of the goodwill non amortization provisions of these rules will have any material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting requirements for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe that sfas no 
will have any material affect on our financial position and results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
and the accounting and reporting provisions of the accounting principles board apb opinion no 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact that sfas no 
will have on our financial position and results of operations  if any 
factors affecting future results our future operating results are likely to fluctuate and therefore may fail to meet expectations which could cause our stock price to decline our operating results have varied widely in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
in addition  our operating results may not follow any past trends 
our future operating results will depend on many factors and may fail to meet our expectations for a number of reasons  including those set forth in these risk factors 
any failure to meet expectations could cause our stock price to significantly fluctuate or decline 
factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate that relate to our internal operations include the need for continual  rapid new product introductions  changes in our product mix  our inability to adjust our fixed costs in the face of any declines in sales  our ability to integrate existing and acquired operations  including the integration of assets acquired from v semiconductor  and successful execution of our strategy to develop and market system level products for the communications and networking markets 
factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate that depend upon our suppliers and customers include the timing of significant product orders  order cancellations and reschedulings  the availability of production capacity and fluctuations in the manufacturing yields at the facilities that manufacture our devices  and the cost of raw materials and manufacturing services from our suppliers 
factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate that are industry risks include intense competitive pricing pressures  introductions of or enhancements to our competitors products  and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
our day to day business decisions are made with these factors in mind 
although certain of these factors are out of our immediate control  unless we can anticipate  and be prepared with contingency plans that respond to these factors  we will be unsuccessful in carrying out our business plan 
we cannot assure you that we will remain profitable because we have a history of losses we incurred significant losses from our inception in through  and again in our accumulated deficit as of december  was million 
we had net loss of million in we cannot assure you that we will return to profitability in any future periods  and you should not rely on our historical revenue or our previous profitability as any indication of our future operating results or prospects 
a sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline upon the completion of v s bankruptcy proceedings  we expect v to distribute the approximately million shares issued to v in connection with our acquisition of certain assets from v to its creditors and stockholders 
if  as we expect  the v creditors or shareholders sell a substantial number of these shares after the distribution  the market price of our common stock could fall 
in addition  if our current stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock  including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options  the market price of our common stock could fall 
such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
if we fail to successfully develop  introduce and sell new products  we may be unable to compete effectively in the future we operate in a highly competitive  quickly changing environment marked by rapid obsolescence of existing products 
our future success depends on our ability to develop  introduce and successfully market new products  including esps 
we introduced our esps in september to date  we have been selling our esps in limited quantities  and we must increase our sales of esp products or our business will suffer 
if any of the following occur  our business will be materially harmed we fail to complete and introduce new product designs in a timely manner  we are unable to have these new products manufactured according to design specifications  our customers do not successfully introduce new systems or products incorporating our products  our sales force and independent distributors do not create adequate demand for our products  or market demand for our new products  such as esps  does not develop as anticipated 
we have only recently introduced our embedded standard products  therefore  we cannot accurately predict their future level of acceptance by our customers  and we may not be able to generate anticipated revenue from these products we have only recently started selling embedded standard products 
in  esps accounted for approximately of our revenue 
we do not know the extent to which systems manufacturers will purchase or utilize our esps 
since we anticipate that esps will become an increasingly larger component of our business  their failure to gain acceptance with our customers would materially harm our business 
we cannot assure you that our esps will be commercially successful or that these products will result in significant additional revenues or improved operating margins in future periods 
if the market in which we sell our embedded standard products does not grow as we anticipate  it will materially and adversely affect our anticipated revenue the market for embedded standard products is relatively new and still emerging 
if this market does not grow at the rate we anticipate  our business will be materially harmed 
one of the reasons that this market might not grow as we anticipate is that many systems manufacturers are not yet fully aware of the benefits provided by embedded standard products  in general  or the benefits of our esps  specifically 
additionally  systems manufacturers may use existing technologies other than embedded standard products or yet to be introduced technologies to satisfy their needs 
although we have devoted and intend to continue to devote significant resources promoting market awareness of the benefits of embedded standard products  our efforts may be unsuccessful or insufficient 
we expend substantial resources in developing and selling our products  and we may be unable to generate significant revenue as a result of these efforts to establish market acceptance of our products  we must dedicate significant resources to research and development  production and sales and marketing 
we experience a long delay between the time when we expend these resources and the time when we begin to generate revenue  if any  from these expenditures 
typically  this delay is one year or more 
we record as expenses the costs related to the development of new semiconductor products and software as these expenses are incurred 
as a result  our profitability from quarter to quarter and from year to year may be materially and adversely affected by the number and timing of our new product introductions in any period and the level of acceptance gained by these products 
our customers may cancel or change their product plans after we have expended substantial time and resources in the design of their products if one of our potential customers cancels  reduces or delays product orders from us or chooses not to release equipment that incorporates our products after we have spent substantial time and resources in designing a product  our business could be materially harmed 
our customers often evaluate our products for six to twelve months or more before designing them into their systems  and they may not commence volume shipments for up to an additional six to twelve months  if at all 
during this lengthy sales cycle  our potential customers may also cancel or change their product plans 
even when customers incorporate one or more of our products into their systems  they may ultimately discontinue the shipment of their systems that incorporate our products 
customers whose products achieve high volume production may choose to replace our products with lower cost customized semiconductors 
we will be unable to compete effectively if we fail to anticipate product opportunities based upon emerging technologies and standards and fail to develop products that incorporate these technologies and standards we may spend significant time and money on research and development to design and develop products around an emerging technology or industry standard 
to date  we have introduced only one product family  quickpci  that is designed to support a specific industry standard 
if an emerging technology or industry standard that we have identified fails to achieve broad market acceptance in our target markets  we may be unable to generate significant revenue from our research and development efforts 
moreover  even if we are able to develop products using adopted standards  our products may not be accepted in our target markets 
as a result  our business would be materially harmed 
we have limited experience in designing and developing products that support industry standards 
if systems manufacturers move away from the use of industry standards that we support with our products and adopt alternative standards  we may be unable to design and develop new products that conform to these new standards 
the expertise required is unique to each industry standard  and we would have to either hire individuals with the required expertise or acquire such expertise through a licensing arrangement or by other means 
the demand for individuals with the necessary expertise to develop a product relating to a particular industry standard is generally high  and we may not be able to hire such individuals 
the cost to acquire such expertise through licensing or other means may be high and such arrangements may not be possible in a timely manner  if at all 
we may encounter periods of industry wide semiconductor oversupply  resulting in pricing pressure and underutilization of manufacturing capacity  as well as undersupply  resulting in a risk that we could be unable to fulfill our customers requirements the semiconductor industry has historically been characterized by wide fluctuations in the demand for  and supply of  its products 
these fluctuations have resulted in circumstances when supply and demand for the industry s products have been widely out of balance 
our operating results may be materially harmed by industry wide semiconductor oversupply  which could result in severe pricing pressure and underutilization of our manufacturing capacity 
in a market with undersupply  we would have to compete with larger foundry customers for limited manufacturing capacity 
in such an environment  we may be unable to have our products manufactured in a timely manner or in quantities necessary to meet our requirements 
since we outsource all of our manufacturing  we are particularly vulnerable to such supply shortages 
as a result  we may be unable to fulfill orders and may lose customers 
any future industry wide oversupply or undersupply of semiconductors would materially harm our business 
none of our products is currently manufactured by more than one manufacturer  which exposes us to the risk of having to identify and qualify one or more substitute suppliers we depend upon independent third parties to manufacture  assemble and test our semiconductor products 
none of our products is currently manufactured by more than one manufacturer 
we have contractual arrangements with two of our three foundry manufacturers of semiconductors  tower and cypress  to provide us with specified manufacturing capacity 
the tower facility is not yet operational 
we purchase product from tsmc on a purchase order basis 
our assembly and test work is also done on a purchase order basis 
if we are unable to secure adequate manufacturing capacity from tower  tsmc  cypress or other suppliers to meet our supply requirements  our business will be materially harmed 
processes used to manufacture our products are complex  customized to our specifications and can only be performed by a limited number of manufacturing facilities 
if our current manufacturing suppliers are unable or unwilling to provide us with adequate manufacturing capacity  we would have to identify and qualify one or more substitute suppliers for a substantial majority of our products 
our manufacturers may experience unanticipated events  like the september taiwan earthquake  that could inhibit their abilities to provide us with adequate manufacturing capacity on a timely basis  or at all 
introducing new products or transferring existing products to a new third party manufacturer would require significant development time to adapt our designs to their manufacturing processes and could cause product shipment delays 
in addition  the costs associated with manufacturing our products may increase if we are required to use a new third party manufacturer 
if we fail to satisfy our manufacturing requirements  our business would be materially harmed 
if we fail to adequately forecast demand for our products  we may incur product shortages or excess product inventory 
our agreements with third party manufacturers require us to provide forecasts of our anticipated manufacturing orders  and place binding manufacturing orders in advance of receiving purchase orders from our customers 
this may result in product shortages or excess product inventory because we are not permitted to increase or decrease our rolling forecasts under such agreements 
obtaining additional supply in the face of product shortages may be costly or not possible  especially in the short term 
our failure to adequately forecast demand for our products would materially harm our business 
fluctuations in our product yields  especially our new products  may increase the costs of our manufacturing process 
difficulties in the complex semiconductor manufacturing process can render a substantial percentage of semiconductor wafers nonfunctional 
we have  in the past  experienced manufacturing runs that have contained substantially reduced or no functioning devices 
varying degrees of these yield reductions occur frequently in our manufacturing process 
these yield reductions  which can occur without warning  may result in substantially higher manufacturing costs and inventory shortages to us 
we may experience yield problems in the future which may materially harm our business 
in addition  yield problems may take a significant period of time to analyze and correct 
our reliance on third party suppliers may extend the period of time required to analyze and correct these problems 
as a result  if we are unable to respond rapidly to market demand  our business would suffer 
yield reductions frequently occur in connection with the manufacture of newly introduced products 
newly introduced products  such as our eclipse family of fpgas  are often more complex and more difficult to produce  increasing the risk of manufacturing related defects 
while we test our products  these products may still contain errors or defects that we find only after we have commenced commercial production 
our customers may not place new orders for our products if the products have reliability problems  which would materially harm our business 
we may be unable to grow our business if the markets in which our customers sell their products do not grow our success depends in large part on the continued growth of various markets that use our products 
any decline in the demand for our products in the following markets could materially harm our business telecommunications and data communications  video audio  graphics and imaging  instrumentation and test  high performance computing  or military systems 
slower growth in any of the other markets in which our products are sold may also materially harm our business 
many of these markets are characterized by rapid technological change and intense competition 
as a result  systems sold by our customers that use our products may face severe price competition  become obsolete over a short time period  or fail to gain market acceptance 
any of these occurrences would materially harm our business 
in order to remain profitable  we will need to offset the general pattern of declines and fluctuations in the prices of our products the average selling prices of our products historically have declined during the products lives by  on average  approximately per year  and we expect this trend to continue 
if we are unable to achieve cost reductions  increase unit demand or introduce new higher margin products in a timely manner to offset these price declines  our business would be materially harmed 
in addition  the selling prices for our products fluctuate significantly with real and perceived changes in the balance of supply and demand for our products and comparable products 
the growth in the worldwide supply of fpga s in recent periods has added to the decrease in the average selling prices for our products 
in addition  we expect our competitors to invest in new manufacturing process technologies and achieve significant manufacturing yield improvements in the future 
these developments could increase the worldwide supply of fpga s and alternate products and create additional downward pressure on pricing 
if the worldwide supply of fpga s grows faster than the demand for such products in the future  the price for which we can sell such products may decline  which would materially harm our business 
we depend upon third party distributors to market and sell our products  and they may discontinue sale of our products  fail to give our products priority or be unable to successfully market  sell and support our products we employ independent  third party distributors to market and sell a significant portion of our products 
during  approximately of our sales were made through our distributors 
two distributors together accounted for approximately of our sales 
although we have contracts with our distributors  any of them may terminate their relationship with us on short notice 
the loss of one or more of our principal distributors  or our inability to attract new distributors  could materially harm our business 
we may lose distributors in the future and we may be unable to recruit additional or replacement distributors 
as a result  our future performance will depend in part on our ability to retain our existing distributors and attract new distributors that will be able to market  sell and support our products effectively 
many of our distributors  including our principal distributors  market and sell products for other companies  and many of these products may compete directly or indirectly with our products 
we generally are not one of the principal suppliers of products to our distributors 
if our distributors give higher priority or greater attention to the products of other companies  including products that compete with our products  our business would be materially harmed 
we may be unable to accurately predict quarterly results if distributors are inaccurate or untimely in providing us with their resale reports  which could adversely affect the trading price of our stock since we generally recognize revenue from sales to our distributors only when these distributors make sales to customers  we are highly dependent on the accuracy and timeliness of their resale reports 
inaccurate resale reports contribute to our difficulty in predicting and reporting our quarterly revenue and results of operations  particularly in the last month of the quarter 
if we fail to accurately predict our revenue and results of operations on a quarterly basis  our stock price could materially fluctuate 
distributors occasionally increase their inventories of our products in anticipation of growth in the demand for our products 
if this growth does not occur  distributors will decrease their orders for our products in subsequent periods  and our business would be materially harmed 
customers may cancel or defer significant purchase orders or our distributors may return our products  which would cause our inventory levels to increase and our revenues to decline we sell our products on a purchase order basis through our distributors and direct sales channels  and our distributors or customers may cancel purchase orders at any time with little or no penalty 
in addition  our distributor agreements generally permit our distributors to return unprogrammed products to us 
contractually  our distributors are permitted to return up to  by value  of the products they purchase from us every six months 
if our customers cancel or defer significant purchase orders or our distributors return our products  our inventories would increase  which would materially harm our business 
many systems manufacturers may be unwilling to switch to our products because of their familiarity with the products offered by our direct competitors such as xilinx and altera  which dominate the programmable logic market the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and characterized by erosion of selling prices over product lives  rapid technological change  short product life cycles  and strong domestic and foreign competition 
if we are not able to compete successfully in this  environment  our business will be materially harmed 
a primary cause of this highly competitive environment is the strengths of our competitors 
our industry consists of major domestic and international semiconductor companies  many of which have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources than we do 
our current direct competitors include suppliers of complex programmable logic devices and field programmable gate arrays  such as xilinx  altera  actel  and lattice semiconductor 
xilinx and altera together have a majority share of the programmable logic market 
many systems manufacturers may be unwilling or unable to switch to our products due to their familiarity with competitors products or other inhibiting factors 
we also face competition from companies that offer asics  which may be obtained at lower costs for higher volumes and typically have greater logic capacity  additional features and higher performance than those of our products 
we may also face competition from suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies  including esps 
our inability to successfully compete in any of the following areas could materially harm our business the development of new products and manufacturing technologies  the quality and price of products and devices  the diversity of product lines  or the cost effectiveness of design  development  manufacturing and marketing efforts 
we may be unable to successfully grow our business if we fail to compete effectively with others to attract and retain key personnel we believe our future success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain engineers and other highly skilled personnel 
our employees are at will and not subject to employment contracts 
hiring qualified sales and technical personnel will be difficult due to the limited number of qualified professionals 
competition for these types of employees is intense 
we have in the past experienced difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified sales and technical personnel 
in  our vice president of sales  michael brown  resigned 
failure to attract and retain personnel  particularly sales and technical personnel  would materially harm our business 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  and may face significant expenses as a result of future litigation protection of intellectual property rights is crucial to our business  since that is how we keep others from copying the innovations which are central to our existing and future products 
from time to time  we receive letters alleging patent infringement or inviting us to take a license to other parties patents 
we evaluate these letters on a case by case basis 
in september  we received an offer to license a patent related to field programmable gate array architecture 
we have not yet determined whether this license would be necessary or useful  or whether a license would be obtainable at a reasonable price 
offers such as these may lead to litigation if we reject the opportunity to obtain the license 
we have in the past and may again become involved in litigation relating to alleged infringement by us of others patents or other intellectual property rights 
this kind of litigation is expensive and consumes large amounts of management s time and attention 
for example  we incurred substantial costs associated with the litigation and settlement of our dispute with actel  which materially harmed our business 
in addition  if the september letter or other similar matters result in litigation that we lose  a court could order us to pay substantial damages and or royalties  and prohibit us from making  using  selling or importing essential technologies 
for these and other reasons  this kind of litigation would materially harm our business 
also  although we may seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights in order to bring an end to certain claims or actions asserted against us  we may not be able to obtain such a license on reasonable terms or at all 
we have entered into technology license agreements with third parties which give those parties the right to use patents and other technology developed by us  and which give us the right to use patents and other technology developed by them 
we anticipate that we will continue to enter into these kinds of licensing arrangements in the future  however  it is possible that desirable licenses will not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
if we lose existing licenses to key technology  or are unable to enter into new licenses which we deem important  it could materially harm our business 
because it is critical to our success that we are able to prevent competitors from copying our innovations  we intend to continue to seek patent and trade secret protection for our products 
the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive  and we cannot be certain that any currently pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents  or that  even if patents are issued  they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us 
furthermore  others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the patents we own 
we also rely on trade secret protection for our technology  in part through confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and third parties 
however  employees may breach these agreements  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
in any case  others may come to know about or determine our trade secrets through a variety of methods 
in addition  the laws of certain territories in which we develop  manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
problems associated with international business operations could affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products most of our products are manufactured outside of the united states at manufacturing facilities operated by our suppliers in taiwan  south korea and the philippines 
as a result  our manufacturing operations are subject to risks of political instability  including the risk of conflict between taiwan and the people s republic of china and conflict between north korea and south korea 
moreover  the majority of available manufacturing capacity for our products is located in taiwan and south korea 
sales to customers located outside the united states accounted for  and of our total sales in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that sales to customers located outside the united states will continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales in future periods and the trend of foreign customers accounting for an increasing portion of our total sales may continue 
in addition  most of our domestic customers sell their products outside of north america  thereby indirectly exposing us to risks associated with foreign commerce 
asian economic instability could also materially and adversely affect our business  particularly to the extent that this instability impacts the sales of products manufactured by our customers 
accordingly  our operations and revenues are subject to a number of risks associated with foreign commerce  including the following managing foreign distributors  staffing and managing foreign branch offices  political and economic instability  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  changes in tax laws  tariffs and freight rates  timing and availability of export licenses  inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  and obtaining governmental approvals for certain products 
in the past we have denominated sales of our products in foreign countries exclusively in us dollars 
as a result  any increase in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currency of a foreign country will increase the price of our products in that country so that our products become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of that foreign country 
as a result  sales of our products in that foreign country may decline 
to the extent any such risks materialize  our business would be materially harmed 
our principal stockholders have significant voting power and may vote for actions that may not be in the best interests of our stockholders our officers  directors and principal stockholders together control approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  if they act together  will be able to significantly influence the management and affairs of quicklogic and all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might affect the market price of our common stock 
this concentration of ownership may not be in the best interest of our other stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  shareholder rights plan  and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a takeover our basic corporate documents and delaware law contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover 
these provisions might discourage  delay or prevent a change in the control of quicklogic or a change in our management 
our certificate of incorporation provides that we will have a classified board of directors  with each class of directors subject to re election every three years 
this classified board when implemented will have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to insert their representatives on our board of directors and gain control of quicklogic 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
the existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the common stock 
we adopted a shareholder rights plan in the plan provides that our board of directors may  without further action by the stockholders  issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions thereof 
the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and the likelihood that such holders will receive dividend payments and payments upon liquidation 
in addition  the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of quicklogic 
our common stock has only been publicly traded for a short time  and we expect the price of our common stock will fluctuate substantially prior to our initial public offering on october   there was no public market for shares of our common stock 
the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our or our competitors results of operations  changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  developments in our industry  and general market conditions and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 
in addition  stock prices for many companies in the technology and emerging growth sectors have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
such factors and fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
if our share price falls further  we could be delisted from the nasdaq national market the minimum per share bid price required under market place rule a to maintain a listing on the nasdaq national market is 
our common stock traded as low as during a delisting could impair our ability to raise additional working capital 
if we are able to raise additional capital  the terms may not be favorable and your investment may be diluted 
furthermore  because prices for delisted stock are often not publicly available  a delisting would impair the liquidity of our common stock and make it difficult for you to sell your shares  and you may lose some or all of your investment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is generally comprised of commercial paper 
we place investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio 
a move in interest rates as of december  would have an immaterial effect on our pretax earnings and the carrying value of its investments over the next fiscal year 
foreign currency exchange rate risk all of the company s sales and cost of manufacturing are transacted in us dollars 
in late  we began to conduct research and development in canada and india 
we also have sales and marketing activities outside the united states 
these costs are incurred in local currency 
if these local currencies strengthen against the dollar  our payroll and other local expenses will be higher than we currently anticipate 
since our sales are transacted in dollars  these negative impacts on expenses would not be offset by any positive effects on revenue 
in  research and development expenses denominated in foreign currencies were approximately of our total research and development expenses 
we expect that approximately of our research and development expenses and approximately of our selling  general and administrative expenses will be denominated in foreign currencies in
