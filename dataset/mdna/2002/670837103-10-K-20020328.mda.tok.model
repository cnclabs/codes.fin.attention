item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis introduction oge energy corp 
collectively with its subsidiaries  the company is an energy and energy services provider offering physical delivery and management of both electricity and natural gas in the south central united states 
the company conducts these activities through two business segments  the electric utility and the energy supply segments 
the electric utility segment generates  transmits  distributes and sells electric energy in oklahoma and western arkansas 
its operations are conducted through oklahoma gas and electric company og e and are subject to the jurisdiction of the oklahoma corporation commission occ  the arkansas public service commission apsc and the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
the energy supply segment produces  gathers  processes  transports  markets and stores natural gas and produces  transports  and markets natural gas liquids 
these operations are conducted primarily through enogex inc and its subsidiaries enogex 
enogex is also involved in commodity sales and services related to natural gas and electric power  primarily through its subsidiary  oge energy resources inc oeri 
the company s business strategy is to assemble a portfolio of assets  people  skills and customers that create optimal value from the convergence occurring in the electricity and natural gas markets 
the company believes its converged portfolio is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in the south central united states 
og e continues to substantially impact the financial results and condition of the company 
og e is the largest electric utility in oklahoma and its franchised service territory includes the fort smith  arkansas area  which is the second largest market and an area of high growth in that state 
og e is expected to grow moderately  consistent with historic trends 
expansion will primarily result from continued economic growth in its service territory 
the citizens of oklahoma recently passed a right to work referendum 
this action along with other initiatives are intended to enhance the state s ability to promote itself as a business friendly location 
enogex owns and operates the tenth largest natural gas pipeline system in the united states in terms of miles of pipe in service 
enogex has a significant investment in natural gas gathering  processing  transmission and storage in the major gas producing basins of oklahoma  as well as gathering and processing operations in west texas 
enogex also has a seventy five percent interest in the noark pipeline system limited partnership  which owns the ozark gas transmission system ozark 
ozark is a ferc regulated interstate pipeline that is operated by enogex  and is located from southeast oklahoma through arkansas and terminates just across the state line in southeast missouri 
enogex  through its affiliate oeri  markets energy products  including natural gas and electric power  and provides energy related services for corporate commodity price risk management and energy forward price evaluations 
enogex also has investments in exploration and production of natural gas and oil with properties located primarily in michigan and oklahoma 
forward looking statements except for the historical statements contained herein  the matters discussed in the following discussion and analysis  including particularly the information under the caption outlook  are forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
such forward looking statements are intended to be identified in this document by the words anticipate  estimate  objective  possible  potential and similar expressions 
actual results may vary materially 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to general economic conditions  including their impact on capital expenditures  prices of electricity  natural gas and natural gas liquids  each on a stand alone basis and in relation to each other  business conditions in the energy industry  competitive factors including the extent and timing of the entry of additional competition in the markets served by the company  unusual weather  state and federal legislative and regulatory decisions and initiatives that affect cost and investment recovery  have an impact on rate structures and affect the speed and degree to which competition enters the company s markets  and the other risk factors listed in the reports filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
overview the following discussion and analysis present factors that had a material effect on the operations and financial position of the company and its subsidiaries during the last three years and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
trends and contingencies of a material nature are discussed to the extent known and considered relevant 
the company reported earnings of a share in  a percent decrease from a share in the reduced earnings reflect lower revenues at enogex and increased operating expense at both og e and enogex 
og e contributed in earnings per share in  down from in the decrease in earnings was primarily attributable to lower kilowatt hour sales to og e s electric customers system sales due to milder weather and higher operating and maintenance expense 
as described in more detail below  revenues at og e were also partially offset by state regulatory actions that reduced recoveries under rate riders previously established by the occ 
enogex operations resulted in a loss of per share in  down from earnings of per share in as described below  the loss at enogex was attributable primarily to poor fractionation spreads in its gas processing business 
enogex earnings also were adversely affected by lower margins in its energy marketing and trading business compared to the results on a stand alone basis of the company ie  as a holding company  which has expenses but no revenues  reflect a loss of per share in  compared to a loss of per share in these results are primarily due to interest and tax expenses 
the company reported earnings of a share in  a percent decrease from a share in record revenues of billion were offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses and increased interest expense 
enogex contributed in earnings per share in  down from in revenues increased at enogex due to higher commodity prices and increased gas marketing volumes  as well as greater natural gas transportation and processing volumes reflecting the full year impact of the tejas transok holding  llc and subsidiaries transok acquisition in mid the higher revenues at enogex were offset by higher gas and electricity purchased for resale  operation and maintenance including a million increase in under recovered pipeline fuel expense and interest expenses 
the holding company incurred increased interest expenses  which resulted in a loss of per share in  as compared to a loss of per share in the reduction in earnings in was partially offset by higher earnings at og e  which contributed in earnings per share in  up from in the increase in og e s earnings was primarily attributable to higher revenues from system sales due to more favorable weather in the last six months of revenue also increased due to the recovery of higher fuel costs 
the increase in revenues was only partially offset by state regulatory action that changed the generation efficiency performance rider gep rider and implemented the acquisition premium credit rider apc rider 
the dividend payout ratio expressed as a percentage of earnings available for common shareholders was percent in as compared to percent in the company s desired dividend payout ratio is percent or below based on the current business environment 
future dividend action will be dependent primarily on two factors 
first  the appropriate payout ratio will be determined by the pace and structure of the deregulation of the electric utility business 
second  the payout rates will continue to be based on current and anticipated operating results 
based on current assessment of these as well as other factors  management believes the current dividend level of will be maintained  however  decisions regarding the payment level of dividends will be made by the board of directors from time to time based on results of operations  financial position  cash flows and other relevant factors 
in september  the director of the occ public utility division filed an application with the occ to review the rates of og e 
og e s rates had last been formally reviewed in in the filing  the staff requested that og e submit information in accordance with occ minimum standard filing requirements by january   for a test year ending september  on january   og e filed its response requesting a million annual rate increase 
og e s filing also outlined several new customer programs and offered not to seek another increase for at least three years 
it has been years since og e requested a rate increase 
a final order in the og e rate case is not expected before summer at this time  management cannot predict the outcome of this rate case or the impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operation 
this development is described in more detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s regulated utility business has been and will continue to be affected by competitive changes to the utility industry 
significant changes already have occurred in the wholesale electric markets at the federal level and significant changes are expected at the retail level in the states served by og e 
in oklahoma  legislation was passed in april to provide for the orderly restructuring of the electric industry with the goal to provide retail customers with the ability to choose their electric suppliers by july  in may  the oklahoma legislature passed legislation postponing the scheduled start date for customer choice from july  until at least in addition to postponing the date for customer choice  the legislation calls for a nine member task force to further study the issues surrounding deregulation 
in april  arkansas passed a law calling for restructuring of the electric utility industry at the retail level 
the law initially targeted customer choice of electricity providers by january   but the law was amended to delay customer choice until october  these developments at the federal and state levels are described in more detail below under electric competition  regulations 
on july   the company  through enogex  completed the largest acquisition in its history by acquiring transok  a gatherer  processor and transporter of natural gas in oklahoma and texas 
transok s principal assets included approximately  miles of natural gas pipelines in oklahoma and texas with a capacity of approximately billion cubic feet per day and billion cubic feet of underground natural gas storage 
transok assets also included nine gas processing plants 
enogex purchased transok for million  which included the assumption of million of long term debt 
outlook the company expects that earnings in will be between and per share  assuming normal weather in the electric utility service area 
the company anticipates a contribution of approximately per share from og e  per share from enogex and per share from results on a stand alone basis as a holding company 
the company also expects to maintain its annual dividend of per share 
the foregoing estimate of earnings per share assumes og e s revenues will increase primarily due to growth in the number of customers and usage by existing customers and a return to more normal weather 
revenues will be partially offset by the expiration of the gep rider in mid on january   the company filed documentation with the occ requesting a million annual rate increase 
approximately million of this total relates to enhanced security as a result of the september  terrorist attacks and approximately million of this total relates to increased capacity needs and reliability upgrades 
the company s filing reflected that final testimony in support of the enhanced security request would be filed in late april the occ staff determined that since testimony regarding enhanced security would not be available until after the january   deadline for the og e filing  the request for recovery of enhanced security costs should be made in a separate filing 
the company s filing also outlined several new customer programs and offered not to seek another rate increase for at least three years 
a final order in this case is not expected before summer the earnings outlook for og e does not take into account any changes in rates that may result from this proceeding 
during and without regard to the ice storm detailed below  the company expects og e s operating and maintenance expense to remain relatively flat at the level with increased property and casualty insurance premiums largely as a result of the september  terrorist attacks being offset by lower bad debt expense 
in january  a significant ice storm hit og e s service territory 
this ice storm inflicted major damage to the transmission and distribution infrastructure 
total expenditures are currently estimated at million 
based on current estimates  the vast majority of these expenditures for restoration of the utility s system will be capitalized as part of the utility s plant 
the company believes that the capital costs will be considered in the pending rate case 
the remaining costs will be deferred pending regulatory approval of a recovery plan 
the company s earnings estimates for do not include any of the costs associated with the ice storm 
beginning with the first quarter of  enogex s operations will be reported into four activities transportation and storage  gathering and processing  marketing and trading and exploration and production 
during  the company expects approximately percent of enogex s earnings before interest and taxes ebit to be generated by transportation and storage due to increased revenues attributable to  among other things  two new long term transportation contracts with independent power producers 
enogex utilizes natural gas storage both to capture price differentials between periods and to support transmission operations 
favorable price differentials are captured by putting physical gas into storage and entering into forward natural gas sales contracts 
storage margins may be optimized by selling physical gas in the cash market to capture short term opportunities 
the company expects approximately percent of enogex s ebit to be generated by gathering and processing due to increased revenues  increased fractionation spreads and a better processing environment 
the company s earnings estimate for assumes a fractionation spread ie  the value of liquids after they are processed out of natural gas  less the gas itself of per mmbtu 
a per mmbtu change in the fractionation spread generally increases or decreases gross margin on revenues by approximately million 
in  enogex also began charging pipeline shippers a treating fee for gas that requires processing for delivery into interstate pipelines when the fractionation spreads are not sufficient to cover the cost of processing the gas  as was experienced in the company expects approximately eight percent of enogex s ebit to be generated by marketing and trading through improved gas marketing efforts 
during  the company expects enogex to continue to improve its operational performance by reducing the volatility related to natural gas processing 
the company continually monitors the market instruments available to hedge the fractionation spread  however  at this time there are no products available that in management s opinion satisfactorily accomplish this objective 
also  effective january   the enogex and transok pipeline systems have been merged to simplify for both enogex and its customers the administration and operation of maintaining two separate pipelines 
results of operations percent change from prior year thousands except per share amounts operating income    earnings before interest and taxes    earnings available for common stock    average shares outstanding    earnings per average common share dividends paid per share in reviewing its operating results  the company believes that it is appropriate to focus on operating income and ebit as reported on its consolidated statements of income 
operating income for was million compared to million in and million in ebit were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the only difference between operating income and ebit is the inclusion in ebit of certain minor non operating activities 
ebit is summarized in the following table and is discussed by business segment thereafter 
ebit by business segment dollars in thousands og e    enogex    other operations  consolidated ebit    other operations primarily include unallocated corporate expenses 
the following ebit by business segment analysis includes intercompany transactions that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
og e dollars in thousands operating revenues   fuel   purchased power   gross margin on revenues   other operating expenses   operating income   other income expenses  net   ebit   system sales mwh a   off system sales mwh   total sales mwh   a megawatt hours og e s ebit decreased approximately million in compared to the decrease in ebit was primarily attributable to lower system sales due to milder weather and to higher operating and maintenance expense 
gross margin on revenues decreased approximately million 
milder than normal weather accounted for about million of the decrease in gross margin 
og e system sales decreased by approximately  megawatt hours or percent 
cooling degree days and heating degree days were approximately percent and percent below levels  respectively 
lower recoveries under the gep rider decreased gross margin by approximately million when compared to the lower level of natural gas transportation cost that og e was allowed to recover from system customers in decreased gross margin approximately million and million as a result of the apc rider  and the gas transportation adjustment credit rider gtac rider  respectively 
gross margin on revenues was also reduced by million due to a return of over recovered fuel costs to arkansas customers through that state s automatic fuel adjustment clause 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these matters 
the decreased margin was partially offset by growth in the number of customers and growth in the consumption of existing customers of approximately million 
also  while the volume of sales to other utilities and power marketers off system sales increased  these sales are at lower prices and margins and increased revenues by less than  cost of goods sold for og e consists of cost of fuel used in electric generation and purchased power 
og e s electric generating capability is fairly evenly divided between coal and natural gas and provides for flexibility to use either fuel to the best economic advantage for og e and its customers 
in  og e s fuel mix was percent coal and percent natural gas 
although fuel consumed was down in  the average cost of fuel per kwh increased percent 
og e s purchased power costs increased million or percent in primarily due to an increase in capacity purchases under a wholesale purchase contract that og e maintains with southwestern public service corp  a percent increase in the cost of purchased energy per kwh and a percent increase in total energy purchased 
variances in the actual cost of fuel used in electric generation and certain purchased power costs  as compared to the fuel component included in the cost of service for ratemaking  are passed through to og e s electric customers through automatic fuel adjustment clauses 
accordingly  while variances in the cost of fuel and purchased power costs may increase operating revenues  such variances have little  if any  impact on gross margin 
the automatic fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the occ  the apsc and the ferc 
the occ  the apsc and the ferc have authority to review the appropriateness of gas transportation charges or other fees og e pays enogex  which og e seeks to recover through the fuel adjustment clause or other tariffs 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other operating expenses include operating and maintenance expense  depreciation and amortization  and taxes other than income 
og e s operating and maintenance expense increased approximately million in employee pension and benefit costs were up approximately million 
pension expense increased primarily due to lower than forecasted returns on assets in the pension trust and the effect of lower discount rates used to measure the accumulated pension obligation 
the general upward trend in medical costs also contributed to the increase in employee benefit costs 
bad debt expense increased by approximately million 
higher than normal bills driven by high natural gas prices early in the year  customer cut off moratoriums imposed during high temperature periods this summer and the general slow down in the economy all contributed to these increases 
the use of contractors to supplement the company s own crews to restore customers power after a major ice storm at the beginning of and a major wind storm in the early summer added approximately million to operating and maintenance expenses 
the increased operating and maintenance expenses were partially offset by a decrease in miscellaneous expenses and an increase in the amount of certain expenses capitalized as part of electric plant 
depreciation and amortization for og e were million higher than in and reflect higher levels of plant in service 
taxes other than income taxes increased million in  reflecting increased ad valorem taxes 
og e s ebit increased approximately  in compared to the increase in og e s ebit was primarily attributable to higher revenues from system sales due to more favorable weather in the last six months of revenue also increased due to the recovery of higher fuel costs 
the increase in revenues was only partially offset by state regulatory actions that changed the gep rider and implemented the apc rider 
in  og e s gross margin increased approximately million or two percent over the level  primarily attributable to warmer weather in the third quarter and colder weather in the fourth quarter in og e s electric service area 
the increased gross margin from system sales was partially offset by a decrease in gross margin that resulted from a percent decrease in revenue from off system sales 
the decline in gross margin off system sales resulted from a reduction in both volumes and prices 
in  og e gross margins were also adversely affected by the actions of the occ in lowering recoveries by million under the gep rider and implementing the apc rider  which reduced revenues by million 
og e s revenues in also were affected by a million annual reduction of its rates in arkansas  which became effective in august cost of goods sold for og e increased million in  reflecting increased cost of fuel used in electric generation and increased purchased power costs 
fuel costs increased million or percent in  primarily due to a percent increase in the average cost of fuel burned for generation of electricity and a percent increase in total energy generated 
during  purchased power costs increased million or percent due to a percent increase in the cost of purchased energy per kwh  which offset a percent reduction in total energy purchased 
og e s operating and maintenance expense increased approximately million in this increase was primarily attributable to higher employee benefit costs and higher labor costs 
depreciation and amortization decreased million in  reflecting certain power plant units becoming fully depreciated during the year 
taxes other than income increased million due to higher ad valorem taxes

enogex s ebit for was million  which was million or percent less than in this decline was primarily due to unfavorable market conditions in natural gas processing 
during  the ebit contribution for the processing group of enogex dropped from a record level of million in  to a loss of million 
this reduction was attributable to poor fractionation spreads in  which resulted in lower gross margins for natural gas processing 
fractionation spreads are the value of liquids after they are processed out of natural gas  less the price of the gas itself 
during the first quarter of  these spreads were negative 
a significant percentage of enogex s volumes were processed under keep whole arrangements 
under these arrangements  and in order to keep its shippers whole on a btu basis  enogex was required to replace the btu value of the liquids with natural gas at market prices 
in order to minimize the impact of these negative fractionation spreads  ethane and propane were rejected whenever possible 
as a result  overall production in was down million gallons from the level 
the average fractionation spread realized in was per mmbtu compared to per mmbtu in for planning purposes enogex uses a historical average fractionation spread of approximately per mmbtu 
also included in the processing margin is a million write down for the impairment of certain processing assets that have been identified as being non core to enogex s operations 
it is anticipated that these assets will be sold by mid improved margins in the gathering and transmission group of enogex for offset a portion of the reduced margins from processing 
during  the gathering and transportation pipeline and storage facilities contributed million  or percent of the enogex ebit  which was an increase of million from the results 
this can be directly attributed to efforts by enogex in to resolve the under recovery of pipeline system fuel expenses that was reported with the fourth quarter results 
enogex filed for fuel recovery rate adjustments with the ferc and the new rates became effective on february  the impact of the filing enabled enogex to significantly improve the recovery of pipeline system fuel expenses for the remainder of the year and in the future 
during  this increased fuel recovery improved the pipeline margin by approximately million 
also contributing to the increased margin in the gathering and transmission group were a million increase in gas storage margins and a million increase in transportation revenues 
partially offsetting these increases to ebit were approximately million of increased operating and maintenance and other miscellaneous expense items 
the margin from exploration and production was million in  which is million  or percent less than the results 
although prices were up approximately percent during  the volumes produced were down by percent 
the production decrease in is primarily attributable to the sale of working interests in for oil and gas properties located in texas and utah  along with a normal production decline curve 
these property sales also contributed approximately million to the enogex ebit from exploration and production 
the asset sales were part of a strategy to focus on exploration and production assets close to the physical gathering and transportation assets 
oeri s marketing and trading activities contributed a loss of million to enogex s ebit for  compared to a million positive contribution in this decline of approximately million was due to the inability to generate natural gas  crude oil and electric power trading margins sufficient to cover the cost of operations 
oeri s trading activities are conducted throughout the year subject to a million annual trading loss limit 
the daily loss exposure is measured using value at risk and other quantitative risk measurement techniques 
accordingly  the trading operations of oeri should not significantly contribute adversely to ebit 
enogex depreciation and amortization increased million in reflecting higher levels of plant in service 
taxes other than income taxes increased million due to higher ad valorem taxes 
enogex s ebit for was million  which was an increase of million or percent over this increase was primarily due to strong market conditions in natural gas processing and greater natural gas transportation and processing volumes reflecting the full year impact of the acquisition of transok in mid these increases were partially offset by higher operation and maintenance and other expenses  including a million increase in under recovered pipeline system fuel expense 
during  the ebit contribution for the processing group of enogex improved by million to reach a record level of million 
this increase was attributable to strong fractionation spreads in  as well as a significant increase in natural gas liquids sold 
the average fractionation spread realized in was per mmbtu compared to per mmbtu in in  natural gas liquids sold increased million gallons or percent to million gallons 
the million improvement in gross margin was reduced by higher operation and maintenance expenses 
the increases in gas liquids sold and expenses were both due primarily to the full year impact of the transok acquisition 
lower margins in the gathering and transmission group of enogex for offset a portion of the record margins from processing 
during  the gathering and transportation pipeline and storage facilities reported negative ebit of million  which was a decrease of million from the results 
this decline is due partially to a million increase in under recovered pipeline system fuel expense 
also contributing to the decline in ebit was a million increase in operation and maintenance expenses primarily due to the full year impact of the transok acquisition 
in addition to increased fuel and other expenses  storage margins declined to million from million in these unfavorable variances were partially offset by a million increase in transportation revenues 
ebit from the exploration and production group was million in  which is million  or percent more than the results 
although volumes produced decreased by percent during  prices increased by percent 
the production decrease in is primarily attributable to the sale of working interests in late for oil and gas properties located in texas and utah  along with a normal production decline curve 
these property sales also contributed approximately million to the enogex ebit from exploration and production 
the asset sales were part of a strategy to focus on exploration and production assets close to the physical gathering and transportation assets 
oeri s marketing and trading activities contributed million to enogex s ebit for  compared to a million contribution in this improvement of million was due primarily to increased natural gas marketed 
enogex depreciation and amortization increased million in and taxes other than income taxes increased million 
both increases reflect the full year impact of the acquisition of transok in mid liquidity and capital resources the primary capital requirements and future contractual obligations for and as estimated for through  and beyond are as follows and dollars in millions beyond og e construction expenditures including afudc n a enogex construction expenditures and acquisitions n a other operations capital expenditures n a total capital expenditures n a maturities of long term debt capital lease obligations total capital requirements operating lease obligations unconditional purchase obligations cogeneration capacity payments other purchased power capacity payments n a n a n a fuel minimum purchase commitments total unconditional purchase obligations total capital requirements  operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations amounts recoverable through automatic fuel adjustment clause total  net n a not applicable in january  a significant ice storm hit the og e service territory 
this ice storm inflicted major damage to the transmission and distribution infrastructure 
total expenditures are currently estimated at million 
the og e construction expenditures in the above chart include the costs for restoration of the electric utility s system 
the company believes its short term borrowing capacity is adequate to finance the restoration of the system 
the area of damage is within counties that were declared a federal disaster area 
og e intends to pursue a plan with the occ to seek recovery of this cost in future rates 
during  og e completed negotiations and contracted with central oklahoma oil and gas corp 
coog for gas storage service 
in july  coog obtained permanent financing and issued a note in the amount of million 
in connection with the permanent financing  the company entered into a note purchase agreement  where it has agreed  upon the occurrence of a monetary default by coog on its permanent financing  to purchase coog s note at a price equal to the unpaid principal and interest under the coog note 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more detailed discussion of these matters 
the company s primary needs for capital are related to replacing or expanding existing facilities in og e s electric utility business and replacing or expanding existing facilities at enogex 
other capital requirements are primarily related to maturing debt  capital and operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations 
the company generally meets its cash needs through a combination of internally generated funds  short term borrowings and permanent financings 
variances in the actual cost of fuel used in electric generation and certain purchased power costs  as compared to the fuel component included in the cost of service for ratemaking  are passed through to og e s electric customers through automatic fuel adjustment clauses 
accordingly  while the cost of fuel related operating leases and the vast majority of unconditional purchase obligations of og e may increase capital requirements  such costs are recoverable through automatic fuel adjustment clauses and have little  if any  impact on total net capital requirements 
the automatic fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the occ  the apsc and the ferc 
the occ  the apsc and the ferc have authority to review the appropriateness of gas transportation charges or other fees og e pays enogex  which og e seeks to recover through the fuel adjustment clause or other tariffs 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
capital requirements and financing activities capital requirements were million in approximately million of the capital requirements were to comply with environmental regulations 
this compares to capital requirements of million in  of which million was to comply with environmental regulations 
during  the company s sources of capital were internally generated funds from operating cash flows and short term borrowings 
the decreases in accounts receivable and accounts payable  in  are reflective of decreased levels of activity by the enogex marketing unit and also reflective of the decreases in the cost of natural gas at both og e and enogex 
short term borrowings were used during to meet temporary cash requirements 
at december   the company had outstanding short term borrowings of million 
on january   enogex retired million principal amount of percent medium term notes due april  on august   enogex retired million principal amount of percent medium term notes due december  this debt had been assumed as part of the transok acquisition 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires the company to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges  as well as the ineffective portion of hedge derivatives  must be recognized as a derivative fair value gain or loss in the income statement 
changes in fair value of effective fair value hedges are recorded in price risk management in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  with a corresponding net change in the hedged asset or liability 
changes in fair value of effective cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  which is later reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction occurs 
physical delivery contracts which are deemed to be normal purchases or normal sales are not accounted for as derivatives 
the company accounted for adoption of sfas no 
on january   by recording a cumulative effect transition adjustment debit to accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately million million net of tax 
this unrealized loss was related to the derivative fair value of qualifying cash flow hedges as of the date of adoption and was reclassified to earnings as the related hedged transactions occurred 
as of december   this amount had been reclassified to earnings 
however  the initial unrealized loss was offset by subsequent gain on these qualifying cash flow hedges of approximately million million net of tax 
the company also recorded a gain  included in operating revenues  related to the ineffective portion of hedge derivatives  for production hedges  of million million net of tax for  resulting in a loss of only approximately million million net of tax 
during march  the company entered into two separate interest rate swap agreements i og e entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert million of percent fixed rate debt  due october   to a variable rate based on the three month london interbank offering rate libor and ii effective july   enogex entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert million of percent fixed rate debt due  january   to a variable rate based on libor 
these interest rate swaps qualified as fair value hedges under sfas no 
and meet all requirements for a determination that there was no ineffective portion as allowed under the shortcut method under sfas no 
on april   the company entered into a one year interest rate swap agreement to lock in a fixed rate of percent  effective april   on million of variable rate short term debt 
this interest rate swap initially qualified for hedge accounting treatment as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 
however  due to unexpected changes in the level of commercial paper issued during the third quarter  hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
was discontinued as of july   and all subsequent changes in the market value of the swap are being recorded as interest expense 
the objective of these interest rate swaps was to achieve a lower cost of debt and raise the percentage of total corporate long term floating rate debt to reflect a level more in line with industry standard and to reduce exposure to short term interest rate volatility associated with the company s commercial paper program 
future capital requirements the company s construction program for the next several years does not include additional base load generating units 
rather  to meet the increased electricity needs of og e s electric utility customers during the foreseeable future  og e will concentrate on maintaining the reliability and increasing the utilization of existing capacity  increasing demand side management efforts and  if necessary  purchasing capacity from third parties 
og e will continue to evaluate these strategies against the construction of additional peaking units or another base load generating unit 
these evaluations will consider  among other things  the amount of capital requirements and the relative cost of fuel supply  compared to other alternatives 
approximately million of the company s construction expenditures budgeted for are to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
as described above  a significant ice storm hit the og e service territory in january this ice storm inflicted major damage to the transmission and distribution infrastructure 
capital expenditures related to this event are currently estimated to be approximately million 
the company believes its short term borrowing capacity is adequate to finance the restoration of the system 
og e intends to pursue a plan with the occ to seek recovery of this cost in future rates 
during  contributions to the employee defined benefit pension plan increased from approximately million in to approximately million in this increase was necessitated by lower investment returns on assets in the employee benefit trusts and lower discount rates used to value the accumulated benefit obligations 
it is anticipated that funding requirements for the plan will remain at the level or be somewhat higher for the next two to three years 
as noted previously  the level of funding is somewhat dependent on returns on plan assets and discount rates 
higher returns on plan assets will decrease funding requirements and increases in discount rates will also reduce funding requirements to the plan 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  in the company made several changes to its pension plan  including the adoption of a cash balance benefit feature for employees hired after january  the cash balance plan may provide lower post employment pension benefits to employees  which could result in less pension expense being recorded 
over the near term  the company s cash requirements for the plan are not expected to be materially different than the requirements existing prior to the plan changes 
however  as the population of employees included in the cash balance plan feature increases  the company s cash requirements may be materially different than the requirements under the company s prior pension plan 
during  the company made contributions to the pension plan that exceeded amounts previously recognized as net periodic pension expense and recorded a prepaid benefit obligation of approximately million 
at december   the company s projected pension benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets by approximately million 
as a result of recording a prepaid benefit obligation and having a funded status where the projected benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets  provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  required the recognition of an additional minimum liability in the amount of approximately million 
the offset of this entry was an intangible asset and other comprehensive income  net of a deferred tax asset  therefore  this adjustment did not impact the results of operations in and is a non cash charge and therefore excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the amount recorded as an intangible asset equaled the unrecognized prior service cost with the remainder recorded in other comprehensive income 
the amount in other comprehensive income represents a net periodic pension cost to be recognized in the consolidated statements of income in future periods 
future financing requirements may be dependent  to varying degrees  upon numerous factors such as general economic conditions  abnormal weather  load growth  acquisitions of other businesses  inflation  changes in environmental laws or regulations  rate increases or decreases allowed by regulatory agencies  new legislation and market entry of competing electric power generators 
future sources of financing management expects that internally generated funds will be adequate over the next three years to meet anticipated construction expenditures 
short term borrowings will continue to be used to meet temporary cash requirements 
og e has the necessary approvals to incur up to million in short term borrowings at any one time 
short term borrowings will consist of some combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper 
the company s ability to access the commercial paper market could be adversely impacted by a commercial paper ratings downgrade 
the line of credit contains ratings triggers that require annual fees and borrowing rates to increase if the company suffers an adverse ratings impact 
the impact of a downgrade would result in an increase in the cost of short term borrowings of approximately five to basis points  but would not result in any defaults or accelerations as a result of the ratings triggers 
at december   the company had in place a line of credit for up to million  with million expiring on january   million expiring on june   and million expiring on january  in january  the company s million line of credit was renewed for million  with an expiration date of january  the company continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance shareowner returns and achieve long term financial objectives through acquisitions of assets that may complement its existing portfolio 
permanent financing could be required for such acquisitions if one was to occur 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to use its judgment to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these assumptions and estimates could have a material affect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  the company has taken conservative positions  where assumptions and estimates are used  in order to minimize the negative financial impact to the company  which could result if actual results vary from the assumptions and estimates 
in management s opinion  the areas of the company where the most significant judgment is exercised is in the valuation of energy trading contracts  pension plan assumptions  gas storage inventory  unbilled revenue for the electric utility  allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable and contingency reserves 
energy trading contracts are entered into by oeri  the trading and marketing subsidiary of enogex 
all trading activities of oeri are accounted for on a mark to market basis 
a risk committee charged with enforcing the trading policies  which include strict guidance on counterparties  procedures  credit and trading limits  monitors these activities 
trading activities include the trading and marketing of natural gas  electricity  crude oil and crude products 
the vast majority of positions expire within two years  which is when the cash aspect of the transactions will be realized 
in nearly all cases  independent market prices are obtained and compared to the values used for mark to market  and an oversight group outside of the trading and marketing organization monitors all modeling methodologies and assumptions 
as a result of this mark to market valuation method  the value of the energy trading contracts may change significantly in the future as the market for the commodity changes  but the value is still subject to the risk loss limitations provided under the company s trading policies 
pension and other postretirement plan expenses and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets and assumed discount rates 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material affect on the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized 
the pension plan rate assumptions are shown in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the assumed return on plan assets is based on management s expectation of the long term return on plan assets portfolio 
the discount rate used to compute the present value of plan liabilities is based generally on rates of high grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which benefits will be paid 
gas storage inventory used in trading activities by enogex is marked to market utilizing a gas index that in management s opinion approximates the current market value of natural gas in that region as of the balance sheet date 
however  the actual market value could materially change in the future due to changes in market conditions such as weather or supply and demand 
og e reads its customers meters and sends its bills throughout each month 
as a result  there is a significant amount of customers electricity consumption that has not been billed at the end of each month 
this unbilled revenue is estimated by adding the amount of electric power generated and purchased less off system sales and estimated line losses  which results in net kilowatt hours available for sale for the current period 
from this number  the amount of billed kilowatt hours are deducted to arrive at an estimate of unbilled kilowatt hours for the period 
these unbilled kilowatt hours are then multiplied by an estimate of the average price to be paid by customers to arrive at unbilled revenue 
the estimates that management uses in this calculation could vary from the actual  but when consistently applied from period to period  this method should not result in any material differences 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is calculated by multiplying the last six months of electric revenue by the provision rate 
the provision rate is based on a month historical average of actual balances written off 
to the extent that historical collection rates are not representative of future collections  there could be an affect on the amount of uncollectible expense recognized 
as discussed in the results of operations  the level of electric accounts receivable charged off in increased due to various factors 
as a result of this increase  the rate at which the allowance is being accrued has been increased 
from time to time  the company is confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability 
these generally relate to claims made by third parties or the action of various regulatory agencies 
management consults with counsel and other appropriate experts to assess the claim 
if in management s opinion the claim meets the definition of a contingent liability as set forth by generally accepted accounting principles  an estimate is made of the contingent liability and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in the company s financial statements 
electric competition  regulation as a result of the failure of california s attempt to deregulate electricity markets and more recently the impact of the enron bankruptcy  attempts to restructure the electricity markets in oklahoma and arkansas have essentially been put on hold 
as previously reported  oklahoma enacted in april the electric restructuring act of the act  which was designed to provide for choice by retail customers of their electric supplier by july  additional implementing legislation was to be adopted by the oklahoma legislature to address many specific issues associated with the act and with deregulation 
in may  a bill addressing the specific issues of deregulation was passed in the oklahoma state senate and then was defeated in the oklahoma house of representatives 
in may  the oklahoma legislature passed senate bill sb  which postponed the scheduled start date for customer choice from july  until at least in addition to postponing the date for customer choice  the sb calls for a nine member task force to further study the issues surrounding deregulation 
the task force includes the governor or his designee  the attorney general  the occ chair and several legislative leaders  among others 
the company will continue to participate actively in the legislative process and expects to remain a competitive supplier of electricity 
the company cannot predict what  if any  legislation will be adopted at the next legislative session 
in april  arkansas passed a law the restructuring law calling for restructuring of the electric utility industry at the retail level 
the restructuring law  like the oklahoma law  will significantly affect og e s future operations 
og e s electric service area includes parts of western arkansas  including fort smith  the second largest metropolitan market in the state 
the restructuring law initially targeted customer choice of electricity providers by january  in february  the law was amended to delay the start date of customer choice of electric providers in arkansas until october   with the apsc having discretion to further delay implementation to october  the restructuring law also provides that utilities owning or controlling transmission assets must transfer control of such transmission assets to an independent system operator  independent transmission company or regional transmission group  if any such organization has been approved by the ferc 
other provisions of the restructuring law permit municipal electric systems to opt in or out  permit recovery of stranded costs and transition costs and require filing of unbundled rates for generation  transmission  distribution and customer service 
og e filed preliminary business separation plans with the apsc on august  the apsc has established a timetable to establish rules implementing the arkansas restructuring statutes 
the occ also has adopted rules that are designed to make the gas utility business in oklahoma more competitive 
these rules do not impact the electric industry 
the rules are expected to offer increased opportunities to enogex s pipeline and related businesses 
the efforts to increase competition in the electric industry at the retail level in oklahoma and arkansas have been paralleled and even surpassed by efforts at the federal level to increase competition in the wholesale markets for electricity 
the national energy policy act of energy act  among other things  promoted the development of independent power producers ipps 
the energy act was followed by ferc order and order  which facilitated third party utilization of the transmission grid for sales of wholesale power 
the energy act  orders and  and other ferc policies and initiatives have significantly increased competition in the wholesale power market 
utilities  including og e  have increased their own in house wholesale marketing efforts and the number of entities with whom they trade 
moreover  power marketers are an increasingly important presence in the industry 
these entities typically arbitrage wholesale price differentials by buying power produced by others in one market and selling it in another 
ipps also are becoming a more significant sector of the electric utility industry 
in both oklahoma and arkansas  significant additions of new power plants have been announced  almost all of it from ipps 
notwithstanding these developments in the wholesale power market  ferc recognized that impediments remained to the achievement of fully competitive wholesale markets including i engineering and economic inefficiencies inherent in the current operation and expansion of the transmission grid and ii continuing opportunities for transmission owners primarily electric utilities to discriminate in the operation of their transmission facilities in favor of their own or affiliated power marketing activities 
in the past  ferc only encouraged utilities to join and place their transmission systems under the operational control of independent system operators isos 
on december   ferc issued order  its final rule on regional transmission organizations rtos 
order is intended to have the effect of turning the nation s transmission facilities into independently operated common carriers that offer comparable service to all would be users 
although adopting a voluntary approach towards rto formation  ferc stressed that order does not preclude it from requiring rto participation 
order set out a timetable for every jurisdictional utility including og e to either join in an rto filing  or  alternatively  to submit a filing describing its efforts to join an rto  the reasons for not participating in an rto proposal and any obstacles to participation  and its plans for further work toward participation 
og e is a member of the southwest power pool spp  the regional reliability organization for oklahoma  arkansas  kansas  louisiana  missouri and part of texas 
og e participated with the spp in the development of regional transmission tariffs and executed an agency agreement with the spp to facilitate interstate transmission operations within this region 
in october  the spp filed its application with the ferc to become an rto 
in july  the ferc determined that the spp did not have adequate scope and configuration to be granted rto status 
the spp was encouraged to explore the possibility of joining an rto to be formed in the southeastern region of the united states and to explore the feasibility of becoming a part of the recently approved rto being established by the midwest independent system operator miso 
the spp and miso entered negotiations during the late summer of to combine the spp and miso and to form a new regional transmission entity that would combine the control areas of miso and spp  capture certain synergies that would be available from the combined organization  and allow member companies in the spp certain options with respect to membership in the combined organization 
the officers of miso and of spp  under the direction of their respective boards of directors have developed documentation to effect the merger of spp and miso into a new organization  and the transaction has been approved by the spp board of directors and the required number of spp member companies 
og e intends to meet its obligations under order and under the restructuring law in arkansas first by executing a conditional withdrawal agreement with the spp 
the conditional withdrawal agreement will have the effect of terminating og e s membership in the spp  except for regional reliability purposes  at such time as the miso spp combination has received all necessary regulatory approvals and the transaction is closed 
following the closing of the transaction  og e currently anticipates that it will join miso 
the transfer of operational control of og e s transmission system to a ferc approved rto is not expected to significantly impact og e s financial results 
yet  it is expected to increase the markets in which og e can sell power at wholesale and  at the same time  to increase competition in such wholesale markets 
as a low cost producer of electricity with two of the most efficient power plants in the country  og e expects to remain a competitive supplier of electricity 
as discussed previously  legislation was enacted in oklahoma and arkansas that was to restructure the electric utility industry in those states 
although implementation of this restructuring legislation has been delayed  if and when implemented this legislation would deregulate og e s electric generation assets and discontinue the use of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation with respect to the related regulatory assets 
this may result in either full recovery of generation related regulatory assets net of related regulatory liabilities or a non cash  pre tax write off as an extraordinary charge of up to million  depending on the transition mechanisms developed by the legislature for the recovery of all or a portion of these net regulatory assets 
the enacted oklahoma and arkansas legislation would not affect og e s electric transmission and distribution assets and the company believes that the continued use of sfas no 
with respect to the related regulatory assets is appropriate 
however  if utility regulators in oklahoma and arkansas were to adopt regulatory methodologies in the future that are not based on cost of service  the continued use of sfas no 
with respect to the regulatory assets related to the electric transmission and distribution assets may no longer be appropriate 
based on a current evaluation of the various factors and conditions that are expected to impact future cost recovery  management believes that its regulatory assets  including those related to generation  are probable of future recovery 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the following recent regulatory matters on june   the occ staff the staff approved a stipulation that og e previously entered into with the staff  the office of the attorney general and a coalition of industrial customers regarding the competitive bid process 
in september  the director of the occ public utility division filed an application with the occ to review the rates of og e 
on january   og e  citing the need for investment in security and system reliability  filed a request for a million annual rate increase 
market risk risk management the risk management process established by the company is designed to measure both quantitative and qualitative risks in its businesses 
a senior risk management committee has been established to review these risks on a regular basis 
the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in certain commodity prices and interest rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  the company enters into various derivative transactions pursuant to the company s policies on hedging practices 
derivative positions are monitored using techniques such as mark to market valuation  value at risk and sensitivity analysis 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to long term debt obligations and commercial paper 
the company manages its interest rate exposure by limiting its variable rate debt to a certain percentage of total capitalization and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
the company may utilize interest rate derivatives to alter interest rate exposure in an attempt to reduce interest rate expense related to existing debt issues 
interest rate derivatives are used solely to modify interest rate exposure and not to modify the overall leverage of the debt portfolio 
the fair value of long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices and management s estimate of current rates available for similar issues 
the following table itemizes the company s long term debt maturities and the weighted average interest rates by maturity date 
see capital requirements and financing activities for related detailed discussion of the company s interest rate swap agreements 
year end dollars in millions there after total fair value fixed rate debt principal amount weighted average interest rate variable rate debt principal amount weighted average interest rate commodity price exposure the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions are the potential loss in value arising from adverse changes in the company s commodity prices 
the prices of natural gas  natural gas liquids and electricity are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in supply and demand 
to partially reduce price risk caused by these market fluctuations  the company may hedge through the utilization of derivatives a portion of the company s supply and related purchase and sale contracts  as well as any anticipated transactions purchases and sales 
see price risk management activities in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
because the commodities covered by these derivatives are substantially the same commodities that the company buys and sells in the physical market  no special studies other than monitoring the degree of correlation between the derivative and cash markets are deemed necessary 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the price exposure to the market risk of the company s natural gas  natural gas liquids and electricity commodity positions 
the company s daily net commodity position consists of natural gas inventories  purchased electric capacity  commodity purchase and sales contracts  and derivative financial and commodity instruments 
the fair value of such position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted market prices 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent adverse change in such prices over the next months 
the results of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  are as follows for fiscal dollars in thousands trading non tradin g commodity market risk  net contingencies the company through its subsidiaries is defending various claims and legal actions  including environmental actions  which are common to its operations 
the company s subsidiaries  primarily og e  also could be impacted by various proposed environmental regulations that if adopted  could result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating expenses 
for a further discussion of these matters  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the normal course of business  enogex issues guarantees on behalf of oeri for the purpose of securing credit for trading activities 
these guarantees are for prompt payment when due of amounts payable by oeri under various agreements 
at december   accounts payable supported by guarantees was million 
since these guarantees by enogex represent security for prompt payment of payables obtained in the normal course of oeri s trading activities  the company does not assume any additional liability as a result of this arrangement 
besides the various existing contingencies herein described  and those described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company s ability to fund its future operational needs and to finance its construction program is dependent upon numerous other factors beyond its control  such as general economic conditions  abnormal weather  load growth  inflation  new environmental laws or regulations  and the cost and availability of external financing
