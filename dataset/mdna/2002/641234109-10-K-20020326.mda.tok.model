the economic aftershocks of the attacks a sharp drop in consumer and business spending exacerbated an already difficult year in the financial markets 
the us economy had entered a recession starting in march  according to the national bureau of economic research  and the equity markets remained deeply below their peak levels reached in march weakening investor confidence drove the standard poor s index down in  its second negative annual return in a row 
almost every major equity index yielded negative returns for the year the dow jones industrial average dropped  the nasdaq composite index declined  and international stocks  as represented by the msci eafe index  fell 
signs of economic recovery began to emerge late in the year  due in part to fiscal and monetary stimuli 
throughout  the federal reserve board engaged in a massive interest rate cutting campaign  lowering short term interest rates to  the lowest level in years 
in washington  dc  a new administration also enacted major tax law changes to boost investments and cut taxes for investors 
although the s p index plunged after the september th attacks  hitting a low point of on september st  it rallied in december and ended the year at 
however  the s p remained well below its record peak of  achieved on march  while equity markets suffered in  fixed income markets rallied  due in part to the federal reserve board s rate cutting actions and a flight to safety by investors 
the lehman brothers aggregate bond index rose during the year 
in an unexpected move  the us treasury department halted issuance of year bonds  spurring demand for long term fixed income securities in other areas of the bond market 
the us agency market performed strongly as buyers flocked to the high quality issues 
corporate bonds also performed well as a class  despite record supply and rising credit quality concerns 
according to moody s investor services  credit downgrades in outnumbered upgrades by a ratio of to  marking the steepest decline in corporate credit since the december  bankruptcy filing of enron corp 
heightened volatility in the energy sector  with ripple effects spreading to other sectors as well  particularly among conglomerates and companies with complex financing structures 
the developments in the market were mostly unfavorable for the securities industry 
declining asset values and narrowing interest rate spreads tended to reduce profits from client financings 
also  the implementation of decimal based pricing in the stock market squeezed profit margins in the market making and trading businesses 
in this environment  we remain confident that our diversified family of investment products and services will help us weather turbulent markets 
despite the volatile market conditions of  we increased our assets under management by more than to billion  from billion in notably  the value style of investing continued to gain favor the s p barra value index outperformed the s p barra growth index for the second year in a row 
while we offer all styles of investing  we believe our longstanding expertise in value investing will continue to serve us well in a difficult market environment 
the increase in our assets under management during this time period supported our belief that difficult market conditions tend to convince more investors both individual and institutional of the inherent value  over the long term  of seeking professional advice and active management of their money 
general our revenues are recorded in the business segments in which they are earned 
we derive our revenues primarily from fees for investment advisory and administrative services provided to our private asset management  mutual fund  institutional and wrap fee clients 
investment advisory and administrative fees that we earn are generally based on the total market value and composition of assets under management 
as a result  fluctuations in financial markets and client asset additions and withdrawals have a direct effect on our net revenues and net income 
our fees vary with the type of assets managed  with higher fees earned on actively managed equity accounts and lower fees earned on fixed income and cash management accounts 
through our broker dealer  neuberger berman  llc  we earn commissions by executing equity securities transactions for private asset management  mutual fund and institutional clients as well as for third parties in professional investor clearing services and research sales transactions 
the majority of our commissions are earned from transactions for private asset management clients 
our commissions  derived from all business segments  may fluctuate based on general market conditions 
also  through neuberger berman  llc  we earn clearance fees for the settlement of securities transactions for various introducing brokers 
we generate additional income by managing cash balances available as a result of our broker dealer activities 
the three principal areas from which we generate net interest income are treasury management managing overnight cash balances  global securities lending activities and client cash and margin balances 
we evaluate these activities by focusing on net interest income 
net interest income fluctuates based on general market conditions  prevailing interest rates and the amount of client cash and margin balances 
our operating expenses include direct expenses  such as employee compensation and benefits  information technology and rent and occupancy  and indirect expenses  such as general and administrative  research  execution and clearance expenses 
direct expenses are charged to the business segment in which they are incurred while indirect expenses are allocated to each business segment based upon various methodologies determined by management 
our largest operating expense is employee compensation and benefits  the most significant component being variable compensation for portfolio managers and sales personnel  which is based largely on commissions and advisory fees 
historically  because we had operated as a partnership  substantially all payments to our principals were accounted for as distributions from principals capital and not recorded as compensation expense 
on october   the members of neuberger berman  llc and the shareholders of neuberger berman management inc exchanged their ownership interests for million shares of our common stock the exchange 
on october   we completed our initial public offering the ipo 
in that offering  we sold million shares of common stock and received net proceeds after expenses of approximately million 
in addition  certain of our stockholders who received our common stock in the exchange sold  shares of that stock in the ipo 
we did not receive the proceeds from the sale of that stock 
in connection with our ipo  we incurred pre tax reorganization and ipo charges totaling approximately million the reorganization and ipo charges 
the reorganization and ipo charges were principally comprised of an initial  irrevocable non cash contribution of common stock to our employee defined contribution stock incentive plan trust the stock incentive plan of million  a cash contribution to the neuberger berman foundation of million and severance and other charges of million 
to allow for a more consistent analysis of expenses  these reorganization and ipo charges have not been directly considered in the discussion of operating results 
prior to the exchange  neuberger berman  llc did not pay united states federal and state taxes because  as a limited liability company  it was treated as a partnership for tax purposes  and its members were taxed on their proportionate share of neuberger berman  llc s taxable income or loss 
neuberger berman management inc  as an s corporation  also did not pay united states federal taxes prior to the exchange  but was subject to certain state and local taxes  and its shareholders were responsible for their own federal income taxes 
effective with the exchange  we became subject to federal  state and local income taxes and we file a consolidated federal income tax return 
results of operations our business is divided functionally into three major business segments private asset management  mutual fund and institutional and professional securities services 
our private asset management segment provides customized investment management services for high net worth individuals  families and smaller institutions through money management  advisory services and trust services 
the investment advisory and administrative services that we provide through our mutual fund and institutional segment include the management of the neuberger berman family of mutual funds  investment management of institutional separate account products and wrap products sponsored by third party brokerage firms and banks 
our professional securities services segment provides trade execution  clearing  custody  margin financing  portfolio reporting and trust services through professional investor clearing services  wealth management services  research sales and other activities  including market making  global securities lending  custody and recordkeeping services and treasury management 
the corporate segment reflects certain corporate results that are not directly related to the day to day operations of our principal business 
these include results from investments in our mutual funds  corporate marketing expense  interest on long term debt and goodwill amortization 
prior periods have been revised to conform with current year presentation 
each of our business segments represents a grouping of financial activities and products with similar characteristics 
the following tables of selected financial data present our business segments in a manner consistent with the way that we manage our businesses

liquidity and capital resources our investment advisory business does not require us to maintain significant capital balances 
however  as a result of our broker dealer activities  our consolidated statements of financial condition include higher levels of assets and liabilities than is typical for an investment adviser of our size 
our broker dealer activities provide financing  trade execution  clearing  custody and global securities lending services for clients of the private asset management  mutual fund and institutional and professional securities services segments 
our financial condition is highly liquid with the significant majority of our assets readily convertible to cash 
our receivable from and payable to brokers  dealers and clearing organizations represent either current open transactions that settle within a few days or the activity of global securities lending that is collateralized and normally can be closed out within a few days 
our receivable from and payable to clients arise in the normal course of business in connection with cash and margin securities transactions 
these client receivables are secured by securities held as collateral 
our cash flows are generally created as a result of the operating activities of our three major business segments  with investment advisory and administrative fees a significant contributor 
cash and cash equivalents increased to million in  with million provided by operating activities  including an increase in our global securities lending activities 
cash of million was used for investing activities  primarily for the acquisitions of executive monetary management  inc  the assets of fasciano company  inc 
and certain of the assets of oscar capital management  llc 
cash of million was used in financing activities  reflecting payments made for dividends and common stock repurchases  partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of our long term debt 
cash and cash equivalents decreased by million in  with million provided by operating activities 
cash of million was used for investing activities  primarily for leasehold improvements and purchases of technology related equipment 
cash of million was used in financing activities  reflecting payments made for dividends and common stock repurchases 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million in  with million provided by operations 
cash of million was used for investing activities  primarily for leasehold improvements and purchases of technology related equipment 
cash of million was used in financing activities primarily due to payments for capital distributions to former principals prior to our ipo  as well as dividends and common stock repurchases  partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
on may   in accordance with rule a of the securities act of  as amended  we sold million principal amount at maturity of zero coupon convertible senior notes due  resulting in proceeds of approximately million 
the issue price represents a yield to maturity of per year  which is accounted for under the effective interest rate method 
each  principal amount at maturity of the convertible securities is convertible into of our common stock upon the occurrence of any of the following events i during any calendar quarter commencing after june   the closing sale price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange for at least trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is more than a specified percentage  initially and declining each quarter thereafter  of the accreted conversion price per share of our common stock on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter  ii we elect to redeem the convertible securities  iii we take certain corporate actions  such as the declaration of an extraordinary dividend  and iv the credit rating by standard poor s is below investment grade 
we may redeem the convertible securities for cash on or after may  at their accreted value 
we may be required to repurchase the convertible securities at the accreted value thereof  at the option of the holders on may of    and we may choose to pay for such repurchases in cash or shares of our common stock 
in the event we are required to repurchase the convertible securities prior to maturity  and we elect to pay for such repurchases in cash  we believe  based upon our current and projected future cash flows from operations  that we will have sufficient liquidity to do so 
we used the proceeds from this transaction for general corporate purposes  including share repurchases 
prior to this transaction  we received a bbb rating from standard poor s 
this credit rating should enable us opportunistically to access the capital markets for additional liquidity if we believe it is necessary 
it is our policy to continuously monitor and evaluate the adequacy of our capital 
we have consistently maintained net capital in excess of the regulatory requirements for broker dealers prescribed by the securities and exchange commission sec and other regulatory authorities 
at december   our regulatory net capital exceeded the minimum requirement by approximately million 
the sec s uniform net capital rule c imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the sec for certain withdrawals of capital 
in addition  the debt covenants related to neuberger berman  llc s million outstanding subordinated note and million committed line of credit include certain covenants that limit the percentage by which the aggregate unpaid principal amount of subordinated liabilities exceeds total regulatory capital and impose a dollar amount below which total ownership equity cannot fall 
we believe that our cash flows from operations and existing committed and uncommitted lines of credit will be more than adequate to meet our anticipated capital requirements and debt and other obligations as they come due 
our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of our common stock in the open market and or private purchases 
the acquired shares may be used for corporate purposes  including shares issued to employees under our employee stock purchase plans 
since the inception of our common stock repurchase program  we have repurchased  shares of common stock  including  shares which were repurchased from a limited number of former principals in a transaction that followed the secondary offering in july  for approximately million 
we used cash flows from operations and the proceeds from our debt offering to fund the purchases of these shares 
as of december   authorizations for the repurchase of up to million of our common stock remain in effect 
on july   former principals and certain of our employees completed the sale of  shares of common stock in an underwriting offering 
although we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock  the ownership percentage of our employees and retired principals decreased to from  increasing our public float 
accounting developments in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas  which became effective on july  for acquisitions after june  and on january  for acquisitions prior to july   states that goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life  but will be assessed for impairment 
in addition  acquired intangible assets are separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  regardless of the acquirer s intent to do so 
as of december   we do not anticipate any goodwill impairment charge as a result of the implementation of sfas in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets sfas 
sfas addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe the implementation of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
looking ahead during the year ending december   we intend to continue to implement our strategic plan to grow our asset management business 
we plan to continue to take advantage of the growth opportunities in the high net worth market by utilizing our expanded national sales force and by aggressively pursuing additional investment management teams 
in addition to adding investment management teams  we will continue to evaluate  where appropriate  strategic acquisitions of  or joint ventures with  companies that would add new product and services offerings  investment capabilities or distribution channels 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our risk management policies and procedures have been established to continuously identify  monitor and manage risk 
the major types of risk that we face include credit risk and market risk 
credit risk is the potential for loss due to a client or counterparty failing to perform its contractual obligations 
in order to mitigate risk  our policy is to continuously monitor our exposure to market and counterparty risk through the use of a variety of credit exposure  position and financial reporting and control procedures 
in addition  we have a policy of reviewing the credit standing  where applicable  of each broker dealer  client and other counterparty with which we conduct business 
we monitor the market value of collateral  including margin loans to our clients  and request and receive additional collateral when required 
a significant portion of our revenues is based upon the market value of assets under management 
accordingly  a decline in the prices of securities generally  or client withdrawals of assets under management  may cause our revenues and income to decline 
interest rate risk is the possibility of a loss in the value of financial instruments from changes in interest rates 
our primary exposure to interest rate risk arises from our interest earning assets mainly securities purchased under agreements to resell and receivable from brokers  dealers and clearing organizations and funding sources bank loans  subordinated liabilities and payable to brokers  dealers and clearing organizations 
equity price risk generally means the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of absolute and relative price movements  price volatility or changes in liquidity  over which we have no control 
our securities owned at december  are primarily comprised of million of us treasury and agency securities  of which million is comprised of us treasury bills  million of municipal revenue bonds  a million investment in one of our mutual funds  the limited maturity bond fund  million of an investment in an exchange traded preferred security  and million related to our market making activity 
the municipal revenue bonds  which are tax advantageous  trade at par and contain variable rates of interest that generally reset monthly  at which time they can be put back to the dealer 
the bonds are rated in one of the two highest categories by at least one but generally two of three rating agencies  standard poor s s p  moody s investors services moody s and fitch ratings 
the limited maturity bond fund  an open ended fund with daily redemption characteristics  is organized under the investment company act of and invests in limited maturity bonds  seeking the highest available current income consistent with liquidity and low risk to principal 
our market making activities expose our capital to potential equity price risk 
to mitigate this risk  we impose strict investment limits on both the trading desk and individual traders 
as part of our prime brokerage business  we write covered over the counter put options on listed equity securities with certain of our prime brokerage clients 
market risk is mitigated as the options are generally deep in the money and covered by an equivalent number of securities sold but not yet purchased 
the notional value of such options and market value of securities sold was approximately million and million  respectively and are included in securities sold but not yet purchased
