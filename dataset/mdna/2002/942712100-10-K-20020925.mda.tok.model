our principal affiliates are watson wyatt llp which conducts operations in the united kingdom and ireland  and in which we hold a interest in a defined distribution pool  and are a member of their partnership board  and watson wyatt company holdings europe limited  a holding company through which we conduct continental european operations 
we own of watson wyatt company holdings europe limited and watson wyatt llp owns the remaining 
we operate globally as an alliance with our affiliates 
however  the revenues and operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations reflect solely the results of operations of watson wyatt 
our share of the results of our affiliates  recorded using the equity method of accounting  is reflected in the income from affiliates line 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from fees for consulting services  which generally are billed at standard hourly rates or on a fixed fee basis  management believes the approximate percentages are and  respectively 
clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis with revenue recognized as services are performed 
for the most recent three fiscal years  revenue from us consulting operations have comprised approximately of consolidated revenue 
no single client accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue for any of the most recent three fiscal years 
in delivering consulting services  our principal direct expenses relate to compensation of personnel 
salaries and employee benefits are comprised of wages paid to associates  related taxes  benefit expenses such as pension  medical and insurance costs and fiscal year end incentive bonuses 
in addition  professional and subcontracted services include client reimbursed travel and other costs specifically billable to clients  as well as fees paid to external service providers for independent contractors  promotion expenses and other services 
approximately of professional and subcontracted services are reimbursed by our clients and included in revenue 
occupancy  communications and other expenses represent expenses for rent  utilities  supplies and telephone to operate office locations  as well as non client reimbursed travel by associates  publications and professional development 
general and administrative expenses include the operational costs and professional fees paid by corporate management  general counsel  marketing  human resources  finance  research and technology support 
historically  we have paid incentive bonuses to associates under a fiscal year end bonus program 
in fiscal years and  in addition to annual fiscal year end bonuses  we provided supplemental bonus compensation to our associate stockholders pursuant to our stock incentive bonus plan in an amount representing all income in excess of targeted performance 
the supplemental bonus compensation pursuant to our stock incentive bonus plan accrued in fiscal year and fiscal year was paid in january and  respectively 
we terminated the stock incentive bonus plan in conjunction with our initial public offering in october and replaced it with equity based incentives 
in conjunction with the company s review of its overhead cost structure in the second quarter of fiscal year  the company examined the classification of its operating expenses 
this review included the identification and evaluation of the costs that comprise general and administrative expenses 
prior to the second quarter of fiscal year  expenses associated with and incurred by various associates from our practice groups the practice support team  for the centralized development of practice specific tools and services  were included in general and administrative expenses 
the costs associated with the practice support team are mainly comprised of the salaries and employee benefits and professional services expenses incurred by the associates on this team 
as a result of our review  in the second quarter of fiscal year  we reclassified the practice support team s expenses from the beginning of fiscal year through the first quarter of fiscal year as components of salaries and employee benefits  professional and subcontracted services and occupancy  communications and other expenses 
these expenses were previously included as a component of general and administrative expenses and represent less than of total operating expenses and revenue for each of the five years in the period ended june  revenue  income from operations  income before income taxes and net income were unaffected by this reclassification 
for more information on the company s reclassification of our practice support team s expenses  refer to the company s form k filed on january critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgements and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we have reviewed the accounting estimates recognized in our financial statements and have determined that the accounting for our pension plans utilizes assumptions that are highly uncertain and can have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition 
pension assumptions we sponsor both qualified and non qualified non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our associates 
under our principal plans us  canada and hong kong  benefits are based on the number of years of service and the associate s compensation during the three highest paid consecutive years of service 
determination of our obligations and annual expense under each of the plans is based on a number of assumptions that  given the longevity of the plans  are long term in their focus 
a change in one or a combination of these assumptions could have a material impact on our pension benefit obligation and related expense 
for this reason  management employs a long term view so that assumptions do not change frequently in response to volatility of the economy in the short term 
the company recognizes that actual returns on investments in fiscal year are lower than our long term expected rate of return 
however  given our historical investment returns  which have approximated over the past years  and the long term view of the plans  we anticipate the plans will realize the expected rate of return 
we consider several factors when determining the appropriate level of each assumption  including economic forecasts  historical trends  portfolio composition and peer comparisons 
assumptions used in the valuation for our us plan  which comprises the majority of the principal defined benefit pension plans obligations and investments  included the following over the past three fiscal years year ended june  discount rate  projected benefit obligation expected long term rate of return on assets rate of increase in compensation levels results of operations

future expected payments are as follows payments due by period in thousands contractual cash obligations total less than year years years after years lease commitments management has determined that there is not a large concentration of leases that will expire in any one fiscal year 
consequently  management anticipates that any increase in future expenses will be mainly market driven 
the company currently has excess capacity in several markets and is actively marketing certain space for sublease 
the recent economic downturn has generally caused current lease rates to decline since the time such leases were signed  which may cause the company to recognize losses to the extent that the company enters into sublease agreements and future minimum lease payments exceed future sublease income 
the company continues to guarantee certain leases for office premises and equipment for wellspring 
at june   minimum remaining payments guaranteed under these leases  which expire at various dates through  total million  excluding sublease income

we are charged a quarterly commitment fee  currently of the facility that varies with our financial leverage and is paid on the unused portion of the credit facility 
no amounts were outstanding under the company s revolving credit facility as of june   nor under its predecessor facility at june  credit under the facility is available upon demand  although the credit facility requires us to observe certain covenants requirements for minimum net worth  which acts to restrict dividends  and other financial and restrictive covenants and is collateralized with a pledge of stock of material subsidiaries 
at june  and at each quarter end during the fis cal year  we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility 
a portion of the revolving facility is used to support required letters of credit issued under the credit line

we are also charged a fee for outstanding letters of credit that also fluctuates based on our leverage ratio 
the credit facility is scheduled to mature on june  additionally  the company guarantees a credit facility which provides loans to associates for stock purchased under our former stock purchase program 
this program was discontinued in conjunction with our initial public offering in october as a result  the facility permanently decreases as the loans are repaid

capital expenditures will be required in conjunction with office lease renewals and relocations required to support our growth strategy 
additionally  our consultants require access to hardware and software that will support servicing our clients 
in a rapidly changing technological environment  management anticipates we will need to make continued investments in our knowledge sharing and financial systems infrastructure 
we expect cash from operations to adequately provide for these cash needs 
our foreign operations do not materially impact liquidity or capital resources 
at june   a total of million of the total cash balance of million was held outside of north america  which we have the ability to readily utilize  if necessary 
there are no significant repatriation restrictions other than local or us taxes associated with repatriation 
our foreign operations in total are substantially self sufficient for their working capital needs
