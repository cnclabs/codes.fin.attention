item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers  develops  and intends to commercialize therapeutic drugs for the treatment of serious medical conditions 
our product pipeline includes product candidates for the treatment of obesity  rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions  cancer and related disorders  allergies  asthma  and other diseases and disorders 
since inception we have not generated any sales or profits from the commercialization of any of our product candidates 
below is a summary of our leading clinical programs  as well as product candidates that are expected to enter clinical trials over the next year 
we retain sole ownership and marketing rights for each of these programs and currently are developing them independent of any corporate partners 
axokine acts on the brain region regulating food intake and energy expenditure and is being developed for the treatment of obesity 
in november  we announced the preliminary results of a twelve week phase ii dose ranging trial of axokine in severely obese patients 
in the trial  axokine was generally well tolerated and patients treated with axokine showed medically meaningful and statistically significant weight loss compared to those receiving placebo 
in september  we reported that patients who completed weeks of follow up after cessation of treatment  on average  maintained the weight loss observed in the twelve week treatment period 
in july  we initiated a phase iii clinical program of axokine in overweight and obese patients 
in january  we announced that we had completed enrollment for a pivotal trial that includes approximately  patients in sites across the united states 
pegylated axokine chemically modified version of axokine that is being developed as a more potent  longer acting form of the protein 
pegylated axokine currently is in late stage preclinical development and we anticipate initiating a phase i clinical trial in mid interleukin cytokine trap il trap protein based antagonist for the interleukin called il cytokine 
il is thought to play a major role in rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases 
in december  we initiated a phase i study to assess the safety and tolerability of the il trap in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
in january  we reported positive preliminary results from the trial 
patients treated with the il trap experienced dose dependent improvements in tender and swollen joints and crp c reactive protein levels  as well as the composite acr american college of rheumatology measure of disease activity 
we expect to initiate a phase ii study for the il trap in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in mid interleukin interleukin cytokine trap il il trap protein based antagonist for the interleukin and interleukin called il and il cytokines which are thought to play a major role in diseases such as asthma  allergic disorders  and other inflammatory diseases 
we expect to initiate a phase i clinical trial of a dual il il trap for asthma allergy related conditions in mid 
table of contents vegf trap protein based antagonist to vascular endothelial growth factor called vegf  also known as vascular permeability factor or vpf 
vegf is required for the growth of blood vessels that are needed for tumors to grow and is a potent regulator of vascular permeability and leak 
in november  we initiated a phase i clinical trial designed to assess the safety and tolerability of vegf trap in patients with solid tumor malignancies and patients with non hodgkin s lymphoma 
angiopoietins a new family of growth factors that act specifically on the endothelium cells that line blood vessels 
angiopoietins may be useful for growing blood vessels in diseased hearts and other tissues with decreased blood flow and for repairing blood vessel leaks that cause swelling and edema in many different diseases such as stroke  diabetic retinopathy  and inflammatory diseases 
selected angiopoietins  including engineered forms of these growth factors  are in preclinical development 
in addition to the above programs which we are conducting independent of any corporate partners  we have formed collaborations to advance other research and development efforts 
we are conducting research with procter gamble in muscle diseases and other fields 
we are also collaborating with medarex to discover  develop  and commercialize certain human antibodies as therapeutics 
in partnership with amgen  we have development rights to neurotrophin  or nt  a clinical compound for the treatment of constipating conditions  although there are no ongoing development activities for nt at this time 
in all of these research collaborations  we retain of the commercialization rights 
we have not received revenue from the commercialization of our product candidates and may never receive such revenues 
before revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates can be realized  we or our collaborators must overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully completing our research and development efforts and obtaining regulatory approval from the fda or regulatory authorities in other countries 
in addition  the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and new developments may render our products and technologies noncompetitive or obsolete 
from inception on january  through december   we had a cumulative loss of million 
in the absence of revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates or other sources  the amount  timing  nature  or source of which cannot be predicted  our losses will continue as we conduct our research and development activities 
our activities may expand over time and may require additional resources and we expect our operating losses to be substantial over at least the next several years 
our losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend  among other factors  on the timing of certain expenses and on the progress of our research and development efforts 
results of operations years ended december  and our total revenue decreased to million in from million in contract research and development revenue decreased to million in from million in under our long term collaboration agreement with procter gamble  research payments decreased effective in the first quarter of to million per quarter before adjustments for inflation from million per quarter for the first two quarters of and million per quarter for last two quarters of in addition  revenue from amgen regeneron partners decreased to million in from million in due to the cessation of clinical trial activity on brain derived neurotrophic factor  or bdnf  in january and the substantial completion of our phase ii studies of nt in  research progress payments consisted of two non recurring payments totaling million from procter gamble related to our long term collaboration agreement and a non recurring payment of million reduced by million of japanese withholding tax from sumitomo pharmaceuticals related to the development of bdnf in japan 
contract manufacturing revenue decreased to million in  compared to million in contract manufacturing revenue related to our long term agreement with merck to manufacture a vaccine intermediate at our rensselaer  new york facility decreased to million in from million in  primarily because intermediate manufactured in the second half of will not be shipped to merck until revenue and the related manufacturing expense will be recognized as the product is shipped  after acceptance by merck 
contract manufacturing revenue in also included million related to the manufacture of clinical supplies of bdnf for sumitomo pharmaceuticals in 
table of contents connection with a research and development agreement 
production of bdnf clinical supplies for sumitomo pharmaceuticals was discontinued in january our total operating expenses increased to million in from million in research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of higher staffing and increased activity in our preclinical and clinical development programs 
this increased activity relates  in part  to the initiation of a phase iii clinical program of axokine in july and a phase i study of the il trap in december research and development expenses were of total operating expenses in  compared to in contract manufacturing expenses decreased to million in from million in in addition to the above described effect of not shipping vaccine intermediate manufactured for merck in the second half of until  the decrease was due  in part  to higher costs in associated with initiating commercial production at our rensselaer facility of both intermediate for merck and bdnf for clinical use by sumitomo pharmaceuticals 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  due primarily to higher administrative staffing to support a larger and more diversified company 
investment income in increased to million from million in due primarily to interest earned on the net proceeds of million from our private placement of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes in october and million from our public offering in march and april the loss in amgen regeneron partners decreased to million in from million in due to the partnership s cessation of clinical trial activity on bdnf in january and the substantial completion of phase ii studies of nt interest expense increased to million in from million in due to interest incurred on the convertible notes issued in october these notes bear interest at per annum  payable semi annually

in may  we entered into a long term collaboration agreement with procter and gamble 
in connection with the collaboration  procter gamble made equity purchases in regeneron of million in june and million in august  and agreed to provide funding in support of our research efforts related to the collaboration  of which we have received million through december  in august  procter gamble made two non recurring research progress payments to us totaling million 
effective december   we and procter gamble entered into a new long term collaboration agreement  replacing the companies agreement 
the new agreement extends procter gamble s obligation to fund regeneron s research through december  with no further research obligations by either party thereafter  and focuses the companies collaborative research on therapeutic areas that are of particular interest to procter gamble 
under the new agreement  beginning in the first quarter of  research support from procter gamble is million per quarter  before adjustments for inflation  through december our activities relating to nt  as agreed upon by amgen and us  are being compensated by amgen regeneron partners for services rendered  and we recognize these amounts as revenue 
in january  amgen regeneron partners discontinued all development of bdnf for the potential treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  or als 
we and amgen fund amgen regeneron partners through capital contribu 
table of contents tions 
we expect to continue funding of the development costs of the partnership in order to maintain equal ownership and equal sharing of the profits or losses of the partnership 
our aggregate capital contribution to amgen regeneron partners from the partnership s inception in june through december  was million 
we do not expect to make capital contributions to the partnership in since there are no ongoing development activities for nt at this time  but additional contributions may be required  depending upon  among other things  whether and how amgen regeneron partners proceeds with the development of nt in connection with our agreement to collaborate with sumitomo pharmaceuticals in the research and development of bdnf in japan  we received a research progress payment from sumitomo pharmaceuticals of million reduced by million japanese withholding tax in april in addition  sumitomo pharmaceuticals has paid us million through december  in connection with supplying bdnf for preclinical and clinical use 
in light of the discontinuation of bdnf development for als  we do not expect to receive further payments from sumitomo pharmaceuticals for research progress payments  contract research and development  or contract manufacturing 
in april  we completed a public offering of million shares of common stock at a price of per share and received proceeds  after commissions and expenses  of million 
in august  we sold  shares of common stock to procter gamble at a price of per share and received total proceeds of million 
the sale of stock to procter gamble was made pursuant to a securities purchase agreement 
in march  we completed a public offering in which we issued million shares of common stock at a price of per share and received proceeds  after commissions and expenses  of million 
in april  we sold an additional  shares of common stock pursuant to the underwriters over allotment option from the march public offering at a price of per share and received proceeds  after commissions and expenses  of million 
in october  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes in a private placement and received proceeds  after deducting the initial purchasers discount and out of pocket expenses  of million 
the notes bear interest at per annum  payable semi annually  and mature in the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  at any time before october   if the closing price of our common stock has exceeded of the conversion price then in effect for a specified period of time 
upon any such redemption  we are required to pay interest that would have been due up through october  we may also redeem some or all of the notes at any time on or after october   if the closing price of our common stock has exceeded of the conversion price then in effect for a specified period of time 
we pledged million of us government securities which will be sufficient upon receipt of scheduled principal and interest payments to provide for the payment in full of the first six scheduled interest payments on the notes when due 
our total expenses for research and development from inception through december  have been approximately million 
we have not historically segregated all the costs associated with each of our research programs and it is not possible to forecast their success or the amounts that we may spend in the future 
we currently have research collaboration agreements with procter gamble  medarex  emisphere technologies  inc  amgen  and sumitomo pharmaceuticals 
in   and  total expenses for research programs conducted under our third party collaboration agreements which also include contract manufacturing expenses incurred prior to commencing commercial production of products for merck and sumitomo pharmaceuticals were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
the remainder of our research and development expenses in those years related to our own internal research programs 
we are currently only committed to incur research expenditures under our research collaboration agreements through the end of and estimate that  based on current plans  such expenditures will total less than million 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  and restricted marketable securities 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the obligations of any other entity 
as of december   we had no established banking arrangements 
table of contents through which we could obtain short term financing or a line of credit 
we may seek additional funding through  among other things  future collaboration agreements and public or private financing 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us or  if available  that it will be available on acceptable terms 
our additions to property  plant  and equipment totaled million in  million in  and million in we also leased an additional million of equipment in in connection with the purchase and renovation of our rensselaer facility  we obtained financing of million from the new york state urban development corporation 
the outstanding balance on this note of million was fully repaid in october we expect to incur substantial funding requirements for  among other things  research and development activities including preclinical and clinical testing  expansion and validation of manufacturing facilities  and the acquisition of equipment 
we anticipate that expenses for basic research and clinical development will increase in by more than over amounts 
we currently anticipate that in  approximately of our expenditures will be directed toward the preclinical and clinical development of product candidates  including axokine  pegylated axokine  il trap  il trap  vegf trap  and the angiopoietins  approximately of our expenditures will be invested in expansion of our manufacturing facilities  approximately will cover our basic research activities  approximately of our expenditures will be directed toward the continued development of our novel technology platforms  including potential efforts to commercialize these technologies  and the remainder of our expenditures will be for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
in  we expect to lease additional space in both our tarrytown and rensselaer locations and incur approximately million in capital expenditures for our expanded manufacturing and research and development activities 
in connection with our funding requirements  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for future lease and long term debt payments 
payments due by period less than to to total one year years years in millions convertible senior subordinated notes capital lease obligations operating leases includes amounts representing interest 
excludes future contingent rental costs for utilities  real estate taxes  and operating expenses 
in  these costs were million 
we expect that expenses related to the filing  prosecution  defense  and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims will continue to be substantial as a result of patent filings and prosecutions in the united states and foreign countries 
the amount we need to fund operations will depend on various factors  including the status of competitive products  the success of our research and development programs  the potential future need to expand our professional and support staff and facilities  the status of patents and other intellectual property rights  the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any of our potential drug candidates  and the continuation  extent  and success of any collaborative research arrangements including those with procter gamble  medarex  emisphere  and amgen 
clinical trial costs are dependent  among other things  on the size and duration of trials  fees charged for services provided by clinical trial investigators and other third parties  the costs for manufacturing the product candidate for use in the trials  supplies  laboratory tests  and other expenses 
the amount of funding that will be required for our clinical programs depends upon the results of our research and preclinical programs and early stage clinical trials  regulatory requirements  the clinical trials underway plus additional clinical trials that we decide to initiate  and the various factors that affect the costs of each trial as described above 
we believe that our existing capital resources will enable us to meet operating needs through at least however  this is a forward looking statement based on our current operating plan  and we cannot 
table of contents assure you that there will be no change in projected revenues or expenses that would lead to our capital being consumed significantly before such time 
if there is insufficient capital to fund all of our planned operations and activities  we believe we would prioritize available capital to fund preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates 
critical accounting policies we recognize revenue from contract research and development and research progress payments as we perform services  provided a contractual arrangement exists  the contract price is fixed or determinable  and our collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
in situations where we receive payment in advance of the performance of services  these amounts are deferred and recognized as revenue as we perform the related services 
non refundable fees  including payments we receive for services  up front licensing fees  technology fees  and research progress payments  are recognized as revenue based on the percentage of costs incurred to date  estimated costs to complete  and total expected contract revenue 
however  the revenue we recognize is limited to the amount of non refundable fees received 
non refundable fees that we receive in consideration for granting collaborators the right to license product candidates developed by us are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the underlying agreements 
this policy conforms with guidance provided by sab with regard to our revenues from non refundable fees  changes in our assumptions of estimated costs to complete could have a material impact on the revenues we recognize 
we have entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with merck under which we manufacture a vaccine intermediate at our rensselaer  new york facility and perform services 
we recognize contract manufacturing revenue from this agreement after the product is tested and approved by  and shipped fob shipping point to  merck  and as services are performed 
in connection with the agreement  we agreed to modify portions of our rensselaer facility to manufacture merck s vaccine intermediate and merck agreed to reimburse us for the related capital costs 
the value of those capital cost payments was deferred and is recognized as revenue as product is approved by and shipped to merck 
the rate at which revenue is recognized is based upon our estimate of merck s order quantities each year through the expected end of the agreement in should actual shipments differ from our estimates  the rate at which this deferred revenue is recognized could change  but the total remaining balance of million at december  will be recognized in the to period 
since we commenced production of the vaccine intermediate in november  our estimates of merck s order quantities each year have not been materially different from merck s actual orders 
research and development expenses include costs directly attributable to the conduct of our research and development  including the cost of salaries  payroll taxes  employee benefits  materials  supplies  depreciation on and maintenance of research equipment  costs related to research collaboration and licensing agreements  the cost of services provided by outside contractors  including services related to our clinical trials  clinical trial expenses  the full cost of manufacturing drug for use in research  preclinical development  and clinical trials  expenses related to the development of manufacturing processes prior to commencing commercial production of a product under contract manufacturing arrangements  and the allocable portions of facility costs  such as rent  utilities  insurance  repairs and maintenance  depreciation  and general support services 
all costs associated with research and development are expensed as incurred 
for each clinical trial that we conduct  certain clinical trial costs  which are included in research and development expenses  are expensed based on the expected total number of patients in the trial  the rate at which patients enter the trial  and the period over which clinical investigators and contract research organizations are expected to provide services 
we believe that this method best aligns the expenses we record with the efforts we expend on a clinical trial 
we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
future impact of recently issued accounting standards the financial accounting standards board has recently issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 business combinations  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  
table of contents sfas no 
 accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets  and sfas no

our management believes that the future adoption of these accounting standards will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
factors that may affect future operating results we caution shareholders and potential investors that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  our actual results and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  us 
the statements under this caption are intended to serve as cautionary statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the following information is not intended to limit in any way the characterization of other statements or information under other captions as cautionary statements for such purpose delay  difficulty  or failure of our research and development programs to produce product candidates that are scientifically or commercially appropriate for further development by us or others 
cancellation or termination of material collaborative or licensing agreements including in particular  but not limited to  the agreement with procter gamble and the resulting loss of research or other funding could have a material adverse effect on us and our operations 
a change of control of one or more of our material collaborators or licensees could also have a material adverse effect on us 
delay  difficulty  or failure of a clinical trial of any of our product candidates 
a clinical trial can fail or be delayed as a result of many causes  including  among others  failure of the product candidate to demonstrate safety or efficacy  the development of serious or life threatening adverse events side effects caused by or connected with exposure to the product candidate  difficulty in enrolling and maintaining patients  lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate  and the failure of clinical investigators  trial monitors and other consultants  or trial subjects to comply with the trial plan or protocol 
in addition to the safety  efficacy  manufacturing  and regulatory hurdles faced by our pharmaceutical candidates  the administration of recombinant proteins frequently causes an immune response  resulting in the creation of antibodies against the therapeutic protein 
the antibodies can have no effect or can totally neutralize the effectiveness of the protein  or require that higher doses be used to obtain a therapeutic effect 
in some cases  the antibody can cross react with the patient s own proteins  resulting in an auto immune type disease 
whether antibodies will be created can often not be predicted from preclinical experiments and their appearance is often delayed  so that there can be no assurance that neutralizing antibodies will not be created at a later date in some cases even after pivotal clinical trials have been successfully completed 
patients who have received axokine in clinical trials have developed antibodies 
delay  difficulty  or failure in obtaining regulatory approval including approval of our facilities for production for our products  including delays or difficulties in development because of insufficient proof of safety or efficacy 
increased and irregular costs of development  manufacture  regulatory approval  sales  and marketing associated with the introduction of products in the late stage of development 
competitive or market factors that may cause use of our products to be limited or otherwise fail to achieve broad acceptance 
the ability to obtain  maintain  and prosecute intellectual property rights and the cost of acquiring in process technology and other intellectual property rights  either by license  collaboration  or purchase of another entity 
difficulties or high costs of obtaining adequate financing to fund the cost of developing product candidates 

table of contents amount and rate of growth of our general and administrative expenses  and the impact of unusual charges resulting from our ongoing evaluation of our business strategies and organizational structure 
failure of corporate partners to develop or commercialize successfully our products or to retain and expand the markets served by the commercial collaborations  conflicts of interest  priorities  and commercial strategies which may arise between our corporate partners and us 
delays or difficulties in developing and acquiring production technology and technical and managerial personnel to manufacture novel biotechnology product in commercial quantities at reasonable costs and in compliance with applicable quality assurance and environmental regulations and governmental permitting requirements 
difficulties in obtaining key raw materials and supplies for the manufacture of our product candidates 
failure of service providers upon whom we rely to carry out our clinical development programs  such as contract research organizations and third parties who fill and label our clinical supplies  to perform their contractual responsibilities 
these failures could lead to delays in our clinical development programs 
the costs and other effects of legal and administrative cases and proceedings whether civil  such as product or employment related  or environmental  or criminal  settlements  and investigations  developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights and licenses  the issuance and use of patents and proprietary technology by us and our competitors  including the possible negative effect on our ability to develop  manufacture  and sell our products in circumstances where we are unable to obtain licenses to patents which may be required for our products 
underutilization of our existing or new manufacturing facilities or of any facility expansions  resulting in inefficiencies and higher costs  start up costs  inefficiencies  delays  and increased depreciation costs in connection with the start of production in new plants and expansions 
failure to have sufficient manufacturing capacity to make clinical supplies or commercial product in a timely and cost competitive manner 
insufficient manufacturing capacity could delay clinical trials or limit commercial sale of marketed products 
health care reform  including reductions or changes in reimbursement available for prescription medications or other reforms 
difficulties in attracting and retaining key personnel 
as our scientific efforts lead to potentially promising new directions  both outside of recombinant protein therapies and into conditions or diseases outside of our current areas of experience and expertise  we will require additional internal expertise or external collaborations in areas in which we currently do not have substantial resources and personnel 
to date  we have received revenues from our licensees and collaborators for research and development efforts  merck and sumitomo pharmaceuticals for contract manufacturing  and investment income 
we may not continue to receive these revenues from our licensees  collaborators  or contract manufacturing customers 
in the absence of revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates or other sources  our losses will continue as we conduct our research and development activities 
our activities may expand over time and may require additional resources  and our operating losses may be substantial over at least the next several years 
our losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend  among other factors  on the timing of certain expenses and on the progress of our research and development efforts 
we do not know if we will ever have an approved product or achieve significant revenues or profitable operations 
we do not expect to receive any revenue from the commercialization of our product candidates for several years and we intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development activities 
even if we do successfully develop products that can be marketed and sold commercially  we will need to generate significant revenue from products to achieve and maintain profitability 

table of contents during the conduct of clinical trials  patients report changes in their health  including illnesses  injuries and discomforts  to their study doctor 
often  it is not possible to determine whether or not these conditions are caused by the drug being studied 
various illnesses  injuries  and discomforts have been reported from time to time during the clinical trials of axokine  our only product candidate that has completed phase ii trials 
the most frequently reported conditions during the axokine phase ii trial were injection site reactions  cough  and nausea or vomiting 
during the phase i study that was conducted in  some subjects developed mouth sores  also known as cold sores  when axokine was given in higher doses than what is being studied in the phase iii program 
these cold sores were thought to be caused by the reactivation of herpes simplex virus  or hsv 
recurrence of hsv was also reported in previous clinical studies of cntf  axokine s parent molecule 
in the phase i axokine study  one patient who had evidence of previous exposure to hsv prior to treatment and had been previously diagnosed with bell s palsy  had a recurrence of bell s palsy approximately two weeks after the patient s last administration of axokine 
in the ongoing phase iii study of axokine  one patient was reported to have been diagnosed with guillain barre syndrome following an upper respiratory tract infection 
although axokine was generally well tolerated in the completed phase ii trial  it is possible that as we test axokine in a large and extended phase iii program  illnesses  injuries  and discomforts that were observed in the earlier trials  as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in these smaller trials  will be reported by patients 
if additional clinical experience indicates that axokine has many side effects or causes serious or life threatening side effects  the development of axokine may fail or be delayed  which would severely harm our business 
most drug research and development programs never lead to the development of commercially successful products 
only a small minority of all research and development programs ultimately result in commercially successful drugs 
we are attempting to develop drugs for human therapeutic uses  and our research and development activities may not be successful and none of our potential product candidates may ever complete clinical trials 
even if clinical trials demonstrate safety and efficacy of our product candidates and the necessary regulatory approvals are obtained  the commercial success of any of our product candidates will depend upon their acceptance by patients  the medical community  and third party payors and on our ability to successfully develop  manufacture  and market our product candidates 
if our products are not successfully commercialized  we will not be able to recover the significant investment we have made in developing such products and our business would be severely harmed

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from our investment of available cash balances in investment grade corporate and us government securities 
we do not believe we are materially exposed to changes in interest rates 
under our current policies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes
