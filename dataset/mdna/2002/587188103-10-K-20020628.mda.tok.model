as required by these standards  revenue is recorded when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the buyer s price is fixed or determinable  contractual obligations have been satisfied  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these requirements are met  and sales and related cost of sales are recognized primarily upon the shipment of products  or in the case of consignment inventories  upon the notification of usage by the customer 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and other volume based incentives 
should the actual level of customer participation in these programs differ from those estimated by the company  additional adjustments to revenue are recorded

the company continuously monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of some of its customers to make required payments 
estimated losses are based on historical experience and any specifically identified customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of the company s customers  or the economy as whole  were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
these adjustments would be included in selling  general and administrative expenses

if actual future demand or market conditions differ from those projected by management  additional inventory valuation adjustments may be required 
these adjustments would be included in cost of goods sold 
warranties and related reserves the company provides an accrual for the estimated cost of product warranties and product liability claims at the time revenue is recognized 
such accruals are based on estimates  which are based on relevant factors such as historical experience  the warranty period  estimated costs  levels of insurance and insurance retentions  identified product quality issues  if any  and  to a limited extent  information developed by the insurance company using actuarial techniques 
these accruals are analyzed periodically for adequacy 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the warranty obligation is affected by reported rates of product problems and costs incurred in correcting product problems 
should actual reported problem rates or the resulting costs differ from the company s estimates  adjustments to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
these adjustments would be included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment the company currently evaluates long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
the company will adopt sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective april  and will be required to analyze its goodwill for impairment issues during the first quarter of fiscal  and then on a periodic basis thereafter

factors that may affect future results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this management s discussion are forward looking statements  the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ significantly from the discussion of such matters in the forward looking statements 
due to the nature of the company s products and business  the company has been and will be involved in various legal actions arising in the course of business  some of which involve product liability and intellectual property claims 
with respect to product liability issues  the litigation and regulatory risks will continue to exist even with respect to those products that have received or in the future may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale 
it is possible that adverse results arising from product liability or intellectual property actions  as well as adverse results arising from regulatory or administrative proceedings  could negatively affect the company s future results of operations 
the company has been and may be in the future the subject of negative publicity  which can arise from various sources  ranging from the news media to legislative and regulatory investigations 
there can be no assurance that such negative publicity will not result in a material adverse effect on the company s future financial position  its results of operations or the market price of its stock 
in addition  significant negative publicity could result in an increase in product liability claims 
the company s products  development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the fda 
the fda regulates the introduction  manufacturing  labeling and record keeping procedures for medical devices 
the process of obtaining marketing clearance and approval from the fda for new products and existing products can be time consuming and expensive  and there is no assurance that such clearances or approvals will be granted or that fda review will not involve delays that would adversely affect the company s ability to commercialize additional products or additional applications for existing products 
in addition  certain of the company s products that are in the research and development stage may be subject to a lengthy and expensive pre market approval process with the fda 
product approvals by the fda can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 
the fda could also limit or prevent the manufacture or distribution of the company s products and has the power to require the recall of such products 
the fda regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation  and there can be no assurance that future interpretations made by the fda or other regulatory bodies will not adversely affect the company 
the fda  various state agencies and foreign regulatory agencies inspect the company and its facilities from time to time to determine whether the company is in compliance with various regulations including manufacturing practices  validation  testing  quality control  product labeling  and reporting 
the fda also reviews promotional materials for compliance with requirements 
a determination that the company is in violation of such regulations could lead to imposition of penalties  product recalls  consent decrees  product seizures  civil penalties  or prosecution 
as a manufacturer of medical devices  the company s manufacturing processes and facilities are subject to regulation and review by international regulatory agencies for products sold internationally 
the company has obtained a ce mark ce marking indicates conformity to the medical device directives for its products sold in europe by demonstrating compliance with the iso  en and iso international quality system standards 
medical device laws and regulations are also in effect in some of the other countries to which the company exports its products 
these range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of the company s medical device products to requests for product data or certifications 
failure to comply with these international regulatory standards and requirements could affect the company s ability to market and sell its products in these markets and have a significant negative impact on sales and results of operations 
a significant portion of the company s products sales are sold to health care providers whose costs are reimbursed by third party payers including the medicare and medicaid programs and private payers  such as group health insurance programs and managed care plans 
the company s products are sold principally to hospitals  physicians  home health care suppliers  and others that receive reimbursement for the products and services they provide from these third party payers 
as a result  demand for the company s products is dependent in part on the coverage and reimbursement policies of these third party payers 
the company s product revenue and results of operations could be affected negatively if third party payers discontinue or limit reimbursement for use of the company s products  or if other treatment options are perceived to be more profitable 
each of the company s major business segments operates its manufacturing  warehousing and research and development activities in a single facility 
while the company has some limited protection in the form of basic insurance coverage  the company s operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected in the event of a fire or similar catastrophe 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the company generally does not use derivative instruments 
the company maintains a portfolio of highly liquid cash equivalents  with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase 
the company also has current marketable securities  consisting primarily of municipal bonds and commercial paper that are of limited credit risk and have contractual maturities of less than two years 
given the short term nature of these investments  the company is not subject to significant interest rate risk 
a portion of the company s operations consists of sales activities in foreign markets 
the company manufactures its products primarily in the united states and europe and sells them outside the us through a combination of international distributors and wholly owned sales offices 
sales to third party distributors and to the wholly owned sales offices are transacted in us dollars or in euros 
the sales offices invoice their customers in their local currency 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in those foreign markets 
the principal exposure on sales to third party distributors stems from the potential for weak economic conditions in the foreign market  thus weakening the foreign currency  decreasing the customer s buying power and potentially decreasing the company s sales 
the company s exposure on sales to its subsidiaries consists of the exposure related to a weakening local currency when payment of the related payables are made resulting in more local currency to pay off the us denominated payable than when it was originally recorded  thus lowering the subsidiaries earnings  and the exposure that upon translation of the subsidiaries monthly financial statements  a weakening local currency would cause sales made in local currency to be recorded in a lower amount of us dollars than if the currency had been stable as compared to the us dollar 
however  in the latter instance  operating expenses would also be translated at lower amounts and  accordingly  the effect on net income would be mitigated 
the company does not currently hedge any of these exposures
