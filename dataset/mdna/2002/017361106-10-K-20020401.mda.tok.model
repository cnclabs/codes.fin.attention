during  monongahela s kwh sales to retail customers decreased 
residential and commercial sales increased and  respectively  and industrial sales decreased 
revenues from residential customers increased 
and commercial and industrial revenues decreased 
and  respectively 
electric revenues from residential customers increased due to an increase in customer usage coupled with an increase in the number of customers 
electric revenues from commercial and industrial customers decreased  primarily due to a decrease in customer usage 
revenues from bulk power transactions and sales to affiliates decreased as a result of a decrease in sales to affiliates as affiliates are now securing their power requirements from allegheny energy supply 
monongahela s regulated electric revenues represented of allegheny s total regulated electric sales revenues to customers 
monongahela s all time control area peak load of  mw occ urred on august  monongahela s electric operating revenues were derived as follows west virginia   and ohio  residential   commercial   industrial   bulk power transactions   and other  
during  potomac edison s kwh sales to retail customers increased 
residential  commercial  and industrial sales increased  and  respectively 
revenues from residential  commercial  and industrial sales increased   and  respectively 
the increase in residential revenues was due to growth in the number of residential customers 
the increase in revenue for commercial customers was due to an increase in the number of commercial customers served partially offset by a decrease in customer usage 
the increase in industrial revenues was due to an increase in customer usage 
revenues from bulk power transactions and sales to affiliates decreased 
as a result of an increase in bulk power sales due to the company selling the aes warrior run output into the wholesale energy market partially offset by a decrease in sales to affiliates as a result of the transfer of the company s generating capacity to allegheny energy supply in august potomac edison s regulated electric revenues represented of allegheny s total regulated sales revenues to customers 
potomac edison s all time control area peak load of  mw occurred on august  potomac edison s electric operating revenues were derived as follows maryland   west virginia  and virginia   residential   commercial   industrial   bulk power transactions   and other  
revenues from one industrial customer  the eastalco aluminum reduction plant near frederick  maryland  amounted to million of total electric operating revenues 
minimum annual charges to eastalco under an electric service agreement  which continues through april   with automatic extensions thereafter unless terminated on notice by either party  were million in during  west penn s regulated kwh sales and deliveries to retail customers decreased 
residential and commercial sales deliveries increased and  respectively 
industrial sales deliveries decreased 
regulated revenues from residential  commercial and industrial customers increased  and 
the increases in revenues for residential  commercial and industrial customers were due primarily to the return of choice customers in the commercial and industrial classes to full service 
also contributing to higher revenues was an increase in the average number of customers in all retail customer classes 
revenues from bulk power transactions and sales to affiliates increased 
west penn s regulated electric revenues represented of allegheny s total regulated electric sales to customers 
west penn s all time control area peak load of  mw occurred on august  west penn s regulated electric operating revenues were derived as follows pennsylvania  residential   commercial   industrial   bulk power transactions   and other  
in  the distribution companies provided approximately billion kwh of energy to nonaffiliated companies and marketers from generation facilities operated by the distribution companies 
revenues from those sales of generation from the distribution companies were approximately million 
the distribution companies transmitted approximately billion kwh to others located outside their service territories under various forms of transmission service agreements 
revenues from those sales were about million 
regulated gas sales increase decrease regulated gas customers bcf sales residential commercial industrial wholesale transportation and other total regulated customers bcf sales regulated revenue millions residential commercial industrial wholesale transportation and other total regulated revenue in  a total of approximately bcf of gas was delivered to retail and wholesale natural gas customers served by west virginia power approximately bcf and mountaineer gas approximately bcf 
of this total  approximately bcf consisted of regulated tariff sales volumes bcf of west virginia power and bcf of mountaineer gas  with the balance consisting of transportation volumes approximately bcf  all of which was transported by mountaineer gas 
consolidated regulated gas revenues totaled million for  of which million represented regulated revenues from tariff sales and million represented revenues from regulated transportation services 
unregulated sales increase decrease kilowatt hour sales unregulated generation total kilowatt hour sales unregulated revenue millions unregulated generation other total revenue unregulated generation sales include amounts for recording ae supply s energy trading contracts at their fair value as of the balance sheet date 
certain amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes 
unregulated sales revenues were  million  which represented of ae s total operating revenues in regulatory framework affecting electric power sales the national energy policy act of epact initiated the restructuring of the electric utility industry by permitting competition in the wholesale generation market 
in order to facilitate the efficient use of generation facilities  on april   the ferc issued orders and subsequent orders a b and a b reaffirmed and clarified the legal and policy determinations originally adopted in orders and  and provided explanations and minor revisions to specific sections of the orders 
the ferc orders require all transmission providers to offer service to entities selling generation services in a manner that is comparable to their own use of the transmission system 
the orders required each transmission provider to file standardized open access transmission service tariffs  therefore  the distribution companies have on file a pro forma open access tariff under which they sell transmission services to all eligible customers 
monongahela and ae supply also arrange for transmission services for their own sales pursuant to the rates  terms  and conditions of the open access tariff 
to meet the objective of providing comparable or nondiscriminatory transmission services  the ferc orders further require that utilities functionally unbundle transmission operations and reliability functions from wholesale merchant functions within the utility 
the distribution companies conduct their business in a manner that is consistent with ferc s standards of conduct 
the ferc established its jurisdiction over unbundled retail  as well as wholesale transmission services  in order although states retain the authority to determine if retail wheeling should be adopted  retail transmission service under the jurisdiction of the ferc is available once these historically franchised customers have access to alternate generation sources 
as the states in their service territory enacted retail choice  the distribution companies revised their open access tariff to authorize sale of open access transmission services to unbundled retail customers 
the distribution companies also have on file with the ferc a standard generation service rate schedule for the sale of wholesale power at cost based rates 
the distribution companies are also authorized to sell power at market based rates and began selling power at market based rates upon acceptance of the filing by the ferc in august separately  a market based rate tariff for ae supply was filed and became effective august  ae supply began serving customers under that tariff on november ae supply also manages its generating assets and the electric generation owned by monongahela as an integral part of its wholesale marketing  energy trading  fuel procurement and risk management activities 
ae supply  as part of its generating asset and energy commodity portfolio  interfaces the electric generating capacity represented by ae supply s generating assets and the electric generation operation owned by monongahela  and various customers or markets 
in early  an arrangement was put in place between monongahela and ae supply to create this interface 
under this arrangement  monongahela sells the amount of its real time  available bulk power generation that exceeds its regulated load to ae supply and conversely monongahela buys generation from ae supply when regulated load at times exceeds that amount of real time  available bulk power generation 
monongahela for its ohio service territory  potomac edison and west penn also purchase generat ion from ae supply under long term power sales agreements to meet their default service obligations 
these transactions take place under the terms of tariffs filed with the ferc 
on december   the ferc issued order no 
 which requires each public utility that owns  operates  or controls facilities for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce to make certain filings with respect to forming and participating in a regional transmission organization rto 
ferc stated in that order that transmission owners are expected to join rtos on a voluntary basis and that rtos will be operational by december  the distribution companies and other transmission owning entities were required to file with the ferc their plans for joining an rto by october  on october   the distribution companies and pjm interconnection  llc pjm announced that they had signed a memorandum of agreement to develop a new affiliation pjm west 
the affiliation was outlined in a compliance filing submitted to ferc on october on march   the distribution companies and pjm filed documents with the ferc to expand the pjm transmission system and energy market through the creation of pjm west 
the filing represents a collaboration between the distribution companies  pjm  and numerous stakeholders 
the distribution companies and pjm have asked ferc to confirm that pjm west satisfies ferc s requirements for an rto as set forth in order no 
the distribution companies also asked ferc to accept certain transmission rate surcharges so that the distribution companies will not suffer a loss in revenues when pjm west becomes operational  and to recover certain pjm west start up costs 
under the pjm west proposal  the distribution companies will transfer operational control over its transmission system to pjm 
the distribution companies will adopt pjm s transmission pricing methodology  including pjm s congestion management system 
in addition  pjm will expand its day ahead and real time energy markets to include pjm west 
as a result  energy suppliers will be able to reach consumers anywhere within the expanded pjm pjm west market at a single transmission rate  instead of paying multiple transmission rates as they do today 
on january   the ferc authorized the distribution companies and pjm to proceed with pjm west effective march  in doing so  however  the ferc stated that it will make a final determination of whether to approve pjm pjm west as an rto in a later order 
the ferc also set for hearing on july   the reasonableness of the distribution companies proposed transmission rate surcharges 
the distribution companies have estimated that without these surcharges  they will lose approximately million a year over the next three years due to lost transmission revenues and incremental pjm west start up costs 
in light of the ferc s order  the distribution companies asked the ferc to delay the effective date of pjm west pending clarification on the scope of issues set for hearing 
by order dated march   the ferc provided the requested clarification of the issues set for hearing  and authorized the distribution companies to go forward with pjm west when it is practical to do so 
the distribution companies anticipate going forward with pjm west on april  the transmission surcharges will go into effect  subject to potential refund  pending the final outcome of the hearing process 
the distribution companies are unable to predict the financial impact of changes to ferc s rto policies 
under purpa  certain municipalities  businesses and private developers have installed generating facilities at various locations in or near the distribution companies service areas  and sell electric capacity and energy to the distribution companies at rates consistent with purpa and ordered by appropriate state commissions 
the distribution companies are committed to purchasing mw of on line purpa capacity 
payments for purpa capacity and energy in totaled approximately million  before amortization of west penn s adverse power purchase commitment  resulting in an average cost to the distribution companies of cents kwh 
electric facilities the following table shows allegheny s operational generating capacity as of december   based on the maximum operating capacity of each unit 
monongahela s owned capacity totaled  mw  of which  mw are coal fired and mw are pumped storage 
the term pumped storage refers to the bath county station  which stores energy for use principally during peak load hours by pumping water from a lower to an upper reservoir  using the most economic available electricity  generally during off peak hours 
during the generating cycle  power is produced by water falling from the upper to the lower reservoir through turbine generators

the following table sets forth the existing miles of tower and pole transmission and distribution lines and the number of substations of the distribution companies and agc as of december  miles of above ground transmission and distribution lines a and number of substations total miles portion of total miles representing kilovolt kv lines number of transmission and distribution substations monongahela potomac edison west penn agc b total a the distribution companies also have a total of  miles of underground distribution lines 
b total bath county transmission lines  of which agc owns an undivided interest and virginia power owns the remainder 
the distribution companies transmission network has extra high voltage ehv kv and above and lower voltage interconnections with neighboring utility systems 
the interregional ehv transmission system  which includes the distribution companies network  continued in to operate near reliability limits during periods of heavy power flows that in the past have had a predominantly west to east orientation 
in early  north american electric reliability council undertook the development of a national transmission security process 
a representative from the distribution companies serves as one of regional security coordinators 
this security process includes a transmission loading relief tlr procedure that identifies actual flow path consequences of all power transactions  and can be used to reduce loading on congested facilities 
the new security process has provided a better exchange of operation planning information and has allowed more accurate evalu ation of the transmission system 
the tlr procedure has addressed congestion caused by parallel path flows  resulting in fewer congestion events on the distribution companies transmission facilities 
as previously discussed  wholesale generators and other wholesale customers may seek from owners of bulk power transmission facilities a commitment to supply transmission services 
see discussion under item sales 
regulatory framework affecting power sales 
such demand on the distribution companies transmission facilities may add to heavy power flows on the distribution companies facilities and may eventually require construction of additional transmission facilities 
the distribution companies have  since the early s  provided managed contractual access to their transmission facilities under various tariffs 
for new agreements starting in  the provisions of the distribution companies open access transmission tariff mandated by and filed with the ferc also govern managed access 
research and development the distribution companies and ae supply collectively spent million and million  in and  respectively  for research programs 
of these amounts  million and million were for electric power research institute epri dues in and  respectively 
epri is an industry sponsored research and development institution 
the distribution companies and ae supply plan to spend approximately million for research in with epri dues representing million of that total 
in addition to epri support  in house research conducted by allegheny concentrates on technology based issues that are important developments for each of allegheny s lines of business 
these technology drivers include products and services for environmental control  generating unit performance  alternative fuels  sustainable and clean coal technology developments  combustion turbine training  environmental effects and perf ormance issues  future generation technologies  use of coal combustion products  transmission system performance  customer related research  clean power technology which includes both power quality technology and distributed generation technology for customers  delivery systems equipment and sustainable energy technologies 
research is also being directed to help address major issues for allegheny and the entire electric industry 
these include electric and magnetic field assessment of employee exposure within the work environment  global warming from greenhouse gas emissions  waste disposal and discharges to land  water and air resources  renewable resources  fuel cells  new combustion turbines  cogeneration technologies  transmission loading mitigation using flexible ac transmission system facts devices and new product development venture opportunities 
the use of biomass for co firing and gasification are being developed with two allegheny stations directly firing sawdust 
the use of biomass lowers production cost  and results in lower emissions of nitrogen oxides  sulfur oxides  particulate matter and carbon dioxide 
it also reduces operation  maintenance and compliance costs 
a new communication technology  patented by employees of aesc and employees of shenandoah elect ronics intelligence  inc  is expected to be purchased and marketed 
this technology is designed to read meters and provide control to customer premises using distribution feeder lines and using digital and power electronic technology 
the baud rate is low but very acceptable for metering and control services 
three aesc employees applied for and received patents in from the us patent and trademark office for wastewater handling and plant optimization technology 
capital requirements and financing construction expenditures ae supply  including agc construction expenditures of ae supply  including agc  were million and million for and  respectively 
total capital expenditures in were  million  including million of construction expenditures and million of unregulated investments  for all generating assets operated or to be acquired by ae supply excluding generating assets currently owned by monongahela  million  including direct acquisition costs  for acquisition of the energy marketing and trading business of merrill lynch  and  million for the purchase of the three midwest generating stations 
in  ae supply s capital expenditures included for environmental control technology 
capital expenditures for and are estimated at million and million  respectively 
the and estimated expenditures include million and million  respectiv ely  for environmental control technology 
outages for construction  clean air act amendments of caaa compliance and other environmental work are  and will continue to be  coordinated with other planned outages  where possible 
future construction expenditures will reflect additions of generating capacity to sell into deregulated markets 
ae supply could potentially face significant mandated increases in capital expenditures and operating costs related to environmental issues 
ae supply also has additional capital requirements for debt maturities 
included in the above figures are agc s construction expenditures  which in amounted to million  and which are expected to be million and million in and  respectively 
distribution companies construction expenditures by the distribution companies  including mountaineer  in amounted to million 
construction expenditures for and are expected to aggregate million and million  respectively 
in  the distribution companies capital expenditures included for environmental control technology 
the and estimated regulated expenditures include million and million  respectively  for environmental control technology 
expenditures to cover the costs of compliance with the caaa and other environmental requirements have been and are likely to continue to be significant 
additionally  new environmental initiatives may substantially increase regulated construction requirements as early as regulated generation related expenditures by monongahela for  and include million  million and million  respectively  for construction of environmental control technology 
outages for construction  caaa compliance and other environmental work is  and will continue to be  coordinated with other planned outages  where possible 
allegheny continues to study ways to reduce and meet existing regulated customer generation service demand and future increases in that demand  including new and efficient electric technologies  construction of various types and sizes of generating units that may be dedicated to regulated service if any  increasing the efficiency and availability of allegheny s regulated service generating facilities if any  reducing internal electrical use and transmission and distribution losses  and acquisition of energy and capacity from third party suppliers whenever market prices are favorable versus native production or demand exceeds native production capability 
the advent of retail choice of generation service supplier has introduced the potential for significant volatility within allegheny s regulated generation service load growth profile 
since customers with choice can be expected to attempt to arbitrage any differentials between generation market prices an d those set by regulators  the distribution companies obligation to meet such load growth will increasingly become an exercise in trying to predict both the variable of general economic conditions in their service territories  as well as relative competitiveness of their regulated generation service pricing  versus the inherently more flexible pricing of unregulated generation suppliers 
monongahela  potomac edison and west penn have contracts with ae supply to supply them with generation service during the ohio  pennsylvania  maryland and virginia transition periods 
under these contracts  ae supply provides these regulated electricity distribution affiliates with full requirements generation service for their retail load obligations  and  in certain instances  their wholesale load obligations 
these contracts represent a significant portion of the normal operating capacity of ae supply s generating assets that were previously owned by monongahela  west penn and potomac edison 
current forecasts  which assume normal weather conditions  project winter and summer peaks within the distribution companies control area to grow at an average rate of and per year  respectively  during the period however  default service peak loads  which are the distribution companies control area loads reduced to account for customers who choose alternate generation suppliers  are presently expected to decline at an annual rate of and  respectively 
the level of competition actually realized for existing loads from the aforementioned unregulated suppliers could obviously have a substantial effect on those default service projections and the degree to which they fail to track with the control area load 
it is anticipated that allegheny s existing resources that are still state regulated  and existing or purchased power of various types  will be sufficient to serve the distribution companies defaul t service loads over the next few years 
construction of new t d assets is expected to continue at its historic rate  with no major divergent expenditures planned 
additionally  while meeting ferc and certain state regulatory requirements to join a regional transmission organization does reassign the responsibility for planning major transmission systems from the incumbent transmission owner to a new independent authority  the distribution companies do not expect their affiliation with and formation of pjm west to result in near term system expansion 
finally  retail choice will not greatly affect the projected need for new t d plants since provision of delivery service remains within the authority of each distribution company 
in connection with its construction programs  allegheny must make estimates of the availability and cost of capital as well as the future demands of its customers that are necessarily subject to regional  national and international developments  changing business conditions and other factors 
the construction of facilities and their cost are affected by laws and regulations  lead times in manufacturing  availability of labor  materials and supplies  inflation  interest rates  and licensing  rate  environmental and other proceedings before regulatory authorities 
decisions regarding construction of facilities must now also take into account retail competition 
as a result  future plans of allegheny are subject to continuing review and substantial change 
allegheny ventures construction expenditures by allegheny ventures in amounted to million and for and are expected to be million  and million  respectively 
construction expenditures millions of dollars actual estimated monongahela generation transmission distribution total potomac edison generation transmission distribution total west penn generation transmission distribution total aesc total construction expenditures  regulated ae supply agc allegheny ventures other total construction expenditures unregulated total construction expenditures includes allowance for funds used during construction afudc  and of monongahela  and  potomac edison  and  and west penn  and these construction expenditures include projects at generating stations  upgrading distribution lines and substations and the strengthening of the transmission and subtransmission systems 
financing programs ae supply to meet cash needs for operating expenses  the payment of interest  retirement of debt and for its acquisition and construction programs  ae supply has used internally generated funds net cash provided by operating activities less dividends  member contributions from ae  and external financings  such as debt instruments  installment loans and lease arrangements 
the timing and amount of external financings depend primarily upon economic and financial market conditions  cash needs and capital structure objectives 
the availability and cost of external financings depend upon ae supply s financial condition and market conditions 
during  ae supply issued million of long term debt and million of short term debt  and issued notes payable to ae and affiliates of million  primarily to finance its acquisitions of merrill lynch s energy trading business and the midwest assets 
ae supply anticipates further financings and member contributions from ae to support future acquisitions and capital expenditures while maintaining working capital 
in addition  ae supply s risk management  wholesale marketing  fuel procurement  and energy trading activities require trade credit support commitments 
as of december   ae supply had total indebtedness of billion

the classification of this debt as due within one year is based upon project cost funding requirements  which are subject to change  as discussed under operating lease transactions below 
short term debt short term debt and notes payable to ae and affiliates increased by million during as of december   short term debt and notes payable to ae and affiliates consisted of commercial paper borrowings of million  lines of credit of million  a million bridge loan used to purchase the midwest assets on may   and notes payable to ae and affiliates of million at rates comparable to short term rates 
ae supply intends to refinance a portion of these obligations with long term financing during at december   ae supply had used million of its lines of credit 
operating lease transactions 
in november  ae supply entered into an operating lease transaction  known as the st 
joseph lease transaction  in connection with a mw intermediate load and peaking natural gas fired facility located in st 
joseph county  indiana 
the st 
joseph lease transaction was structured to finance the construction of both the peaking and intermediate facility with a maximum commitment amount of million 
ae supply will lease the plant from a nonaffiliated special purpose entity when the construction has been completed 
lease payments  to be recorded as rent expense  are estimated at million per month  commencing on final completion of the entire facility in and continuing through november if ae supply is unable to renew the lease in november  ae supply must either purchase the facility for the lessor s investment  or terminate the lease  abandon  and releas e its interest in the facility  or sell the facility and pay the amount  if any  by which the lessor s investment exceeds the sale proceeds  up to a maximum recourse amount of approximately million 
based on costs incurred on the project through december   ae supply s maximum recourse obligation was million  reflecting a lessor investment of million 
in april  ae supply entered into an operating equipment lease transaction structured to finance the purchase of turbines and transformers with a maximum commitment amount of million 
the st 
joseph lease transaction included a transfer between lessors of some of the equipment previously financed in this lease 
as a result  the commitment in the equipment lease has been reduced to approximately million 
the remainder of the equipment financed in the lease will be used for another project 
during  ae supply plans to purchase this equipment for the amount of the lessor s investment  which was million on december  included in the st 
joseph lease transaction is a loan to ae supply of million from the nonaffiliated special purpose entity 
ae supply is required to repay the loan during the construction period of the leased facility based on project cost funding requirements 
loan repayments were million in and are estimated to be million in  million in  and million in on the closing date of the st 
joseph lease transaction  ae supply repaid approximately million of the loan and used approximately million of the net proceeds to refinance existing short term debt 
at december   ae supply recorded million and million as short term and long term debt  respectively  based on the project cost funding requirements  which are subject to change 
the loan is required to be repaid if the lease balance or maximum recourse amount becomes payable under the lease 
in november  ae supply entered into an operating lease transaction relating to the construction of a mw combined cycle generating facility located in springdale  pennsylvania 
this transaction was structured to finance the construction of the facility with a maximum commitment amount of million 
upon completion of the facility  a special purpose entity will lease the facility to ae supply 
lease payments  to be recorded as rent expense  are estimated at million per month  commencing during the second half of through november subsequently  ae supply has the right to negotiate a renewal of the lease 
if ae supply is unable to renew the lease in november  it must either purchase the facility for the lessor s investment  or sell the facility and pay the difference between the proceeds and the lessor s investment up to a maximum recourse amount of approximately million 
based on costs incurred on the project through decem ber   ae supply s maximum recourse obligation was approximately million  reflecting a lessor investment of million 
these operating lease transactions contain covenants  including maximum debt to capitalization ratios  which require compliance in order to avoid defaults and acceleration of payments 
an event of default could require ae supply to pay of the lessor s investment 
the lease transactions for the st 
joseph and springdale facilities are classified as operating leases  which are off balance sheet  as of december   in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
however  a change in the accounting standards applicable to leases could result in the consolidation of the related special purpose entities  with debt issued by the special purpose entities included in ae supply s long term debt 
as of december   the effect of consolidating these special purpose entities would be to increase ae supply s debt by million 
credit 
ae supply has established a letter of credit facility for million to provide for the issuance of letters of credit to support its energy trading activities and for general corporate purposes 
letters of credit are purchased guarantees that ensure ae supply s performance or payment to third parties  in accordance with certain terms and conditions 
in particular  ae supply regularly posts cash deposits or letters of credit to collateralize a portion of its energy trading activities 
this facility also requires the maintenance of a certain fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum debt to capitalization ratio  as well as the maintenance of an investment grade credit rating 
at december   there was million outstanding under the banks letters of credit

the use of desulfurization equipment and the cleaning and blending of coal make burning local coal practical 
in  almost of the coal received at these stations came from mines in west virginia  pennsylvania  maryland and ohio 
none of the allegheny companies mine or clean any coal 
all raw  clean or washed coal from suppliers is purchased as necessary to meet station requirements 
in  ae supply and monongahela had long term arrangements ie  terms of months or longer in place to purchase approximately million tons of coal 
ae supply purchases coal from a limited number of suppliers 
in  ae supply and monongahela purchased approximately million tons of coal of fuel used from various local mines owned by subsidiary companies of one coal company 
long term arrangements ie  terms of months or longer are in effect to provide for up to approximately million tons of coal in monongahela and ae supply will depend on short term arrangements and spot purchases for their remaining requirements 
for each of the years through  the average cost per ton of coal burned was   and  respectively 
for the year  the cost per ton was 
the distribution companies own coal reserves estimated to contain about million tons of higher sulfur coal recoverable by deep mining 
there are no present plans to mine these reserves and  in view of economic conditions now prevailing in the coal market  the distribution companies plan to hold the reserves as a long term resource 
the addition of natural gas fired generation  both through acquisitions and construction  will diversify ae supply s fuel mix from the current predominantly coal fired generation facilities 
this change in fuel mix and diversification is expected to assist ae supply in reducing business risks 
long term arrangements  subject to price change  are in effect and will provide for the lime requirements of scrubbers at allegheny s scrubbed stations 
distribution gas supply on september   mountaineer entered into a natural gas supply management agreement coral agreement with coral energy resources  lp coral an affiliate of shell oil company  pursuant to which coral became the principal gas supplier for mountaineer for a three year period commencing as of november  the term of the coral agreement coincided with the three year west virginia rate moratorium 
the rate moratorium froze mountaineer s resale rates fuel and base until october  mountaineer was subsequently granted authority to increase its rates beginning november  for additional information  see rate matters below 
the coral agreement provided that coral would be responsible for supplying in excess of of mountaineer s total annual gas requirements for the three year term which ended november  the balance of mountaineer s gas supply requirements during the term of the coral agreement were purchased from local producers  including mgs owned operated production  adding up to approximately bcf year 
coral supplied the gas at a fixed price per decatherm dth at the city gate up to approximately bcf annually 
currently  mountaineer fulfills its gas requirements via purchases from various producers located in appalachia and the gulf of mexico 
the following table indicates the volume of natural gas purchased and percentage of total volume of natural gas purchased  with respect to mountaineer s largest suppliers for the twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  volume mmcf of total mgs owned controlled production coral energy resources  lp other gulf coast producing region producers suppliers other appalachian basin producers suppliers the west virginia psc regulates mgs sales to mountaineer  which accounts for the majority of mgs sales 
the contract term is november  through october  the price for these sales is calculated by adding the inside ferc s gas market report columbia gas appalachia index index and the columbia gas fts commodity rate approximately cents per dth  and a fuel factor that is approximately of the index that is paid in kind 
mgs production makes up in excess of of the total local production purchased by mountaineer 
in december  monongahela purchased the assets of west virginia power from utilicorp united inc the following table sets forth the volume of monongahela utilicorp united s natural gas purchases and percentage of total volume of natural gas purchased  excluding mountaineer s own purchases and production  for the twelve months ended december   and december twelve months ended twelve months ended volume mmcf of total volume mmcf of total wv production contracts cabot oil and gas marketing other supply volumes annual totals gas transportation and storage capacity gas purchased from producer suppliers in the gulf coast producing basin region is transported through the interstate pipeline systems of columbia gulf transmission company columbia gulf and columbia gas transmission corporation columbia gas to mountaineer s and west virginia power s local distribution facilities in west virginia 
to ensure continuous  uninterrupted service to its customers  mountaineer has in place long term transportation and storage service agreements with columbia gas and columbia gulf 
these contracts cover a wide range of transportation services and volumes  ranging from firm transportation service to no notice service and storage with such contracts expiring on october  under both mgc s and west virginia power s purchased gas adjustment pga  these costs  if prudently incurred  are recovered from the respective companies customers 
typically  the gas industry uses gas sales and or transportation contracts for load management purposes 
under such contracts  the users purchase and or transport gas with the understanding that they may be forced to shut down or switch to alternate sources of energy at times when the gas is needed for higher priority customers or interruptible transportation on the transporting pipeline is curtailed 
in addition  during times of extraordinary supply problems  curtailments of deliveries to customers with firm contracts may be made in accordance with guidelines established by appropriate federal and state regulatory agencies 
since july  mountaineer has served a number of interruptible sales customers some of whom are capable of utilizing alternate fuels as an energy source at their respective business facilities 
in  mountaineer did not have to interrupt these customers because of supply or transportation capacity scarcity or curtailments 
rate matters monongahela in march  the west virginia legislature passed house resolution approving an electric deregulation plan submitted by the west virginia psc with certain modifications 
under the resolution  the implementation of the west virginia deregulation plan cannot occur until the legislature enacts certain tax changes regarding the preservation of tax revenues for state and local government and other changes conforming to the plan and authorizing implementation 
the plan provides for all customers to have choice of a generation supplier and allows monongahela to transfer the west virginia portion approximately  mw of owned capacity and mw of capacity in generating units at which monongahela does not exercise control over percent of the facility of its generating assets to ae supply 
the legislative session ended april   with no final legislative action regarding implementation of the deregulation plan 
it is unlikely that the legisl ative action needed to implement the west virginia plan will occur in on june   the west virginia psc issued an order regarding the transfer of the generating assets of monongahela 
in part  the order requires that  after implementation of the deregulation plan  monongahela file a petition seeking a west virginia psc finding that the proposed transfer of generating assets complies with the conditions of the deregulation plan 
the june  order also permits monongahela to submit a petition to the west virginia psc seeking approval to transfer its west virginia generating assets prior to the implementation of the deregulation plan 
a filing before implementation of the deregulation plan is required to include commitments to the consumer and other protections contained in the deregulation plan 
on august   with a supplemental filing on october   monongahela filed a petition seeking west virginia psc approval to transfer its west virginia generating assets to ae supply 
settlement discussions regar ding the generating asset transfer continue with various parties 
on october   the west virginia psc approved an interim increase of the commodity rate for gas customers of monongahela formerly west virginia power customers for gas service bills rendered on and after december  on december   the west virginia psc approved additional increases for bills rendered on and after january  through november  total revenue increase for the twelve month period of million or 
the commodity rate  or pga rate  is the portion of the bill that reflects the cost of gas  which increased significantly during the west virginia psc approved a tiered rate structure with rates established for the winter heating season  effective january  through april  and further increased rates effective may  through november   dependent upon the level of cost recovery after the winter heating season 
this approach allowed monongahela full recovery of these costs but eased the increase on the average customer 
on october   the west virginia psc approved an interim decrease in the pga rate effective with bills rendered on and after december  through november  total revenue decrease for the twelve month period of million or 
this approval became final on december  the reduced pga rate is the result of changes in the market price monongahela pays for natural gas 
with this adjustment  customers will benefit from recent decreases in national market prices 
these increases and decreases in gas cost recovery revenues have no effect on earnings because they were implemented via the pga mechanism 
under the pga procedure  differences between revenues received for energy costs and actual energy costs are deferred until the next proceeding when energy rates are adjusted to return or recover previous over recoveries or under recoveries  respectively 
on january   mountaineer filed for a rate increase with the west virginia psc in response to  among other things  the significant increases in the market price for natural gas since july when mountaineer and the commission  among others  agreed to the three year rate moratorium that ended on october  as a result of extensive discussions among the parties  a settlement was reached and on july   a joint stipulation and agreement for settlement was filed with the commission 
in october  the commission approved the settlement agreement which provides for a base revenue increase of million per year and an increase in gas cost recovery revenues of approximately million per year a total increase of approximately percent over existing rates effective november  also  mountaineer returned to standard pga treatment of purchased gas costs at the conclusion of the rate moratorium  beginning november  with the pga  increases and decreases in gas costs prudently incurred have no effect on earnings 
in october  the puco approved a settlement that implemented a restructuring plan for monongahela 
this restructuring plan allowed ohio customers of monongahela to choose their generation supplier starting january  also  monongahela was permitted to transfer the ohio portion approximately mw of its generating assets to ae supply at book value 
monongahela transferred these generating assets on june  additionally  the plan provides for the following residential customers will receive a five percent reduction in the generation portion of their electric bills during a five year market development period which began on january  and these rates will be frozen for the five years  for commercial and industrial customers  existing generation rates will be frozen at the current rates for the market development period  which began on january  the market development period is three years for large commercial and industrial c ustomers and five years for small commercial customers  monongahela will collect from shopping customers a regulatory transition charge of per kilowatt hour kwh for the market development period  and  ae supply is permitted to offer competitive generation service throughout ohio 
potomac edison in december  the maryland psc approved a settlement agreement  which allowed customer choice of generation suppliers effective july   for nearly all maryland customers of potomac edison 
in june  the maryland psc authorized potomac edison to transfer the maryland portion of its generating assets to ae supply 
potomac edison also obtained the necessary approvals from the virginia scc and the west virginia psc to transfer the virginia and west virginia portions of potomac edison s generating assets to ae supply in conjunction with the transfer of the maryland portion of those assets 
in august  potomac edison transferred approximately  mw of its maryland  virginia  and west virginia generating assets to ae supply 
on july   the virginia scc issued an order  approving phase i of potomac edison s functional separation plan that provided for the transfer of its virginia jurisdictional generating assets at book value to ae supply 
in conjunction with the separation plan  the virginia scc approved a memorandum of understanding mou 
the mou provided that  effective with bills rendered on or after august   base rates were reduced by million  potomac edison would not file for a base rate increase prior to january   and the fuel rate would be rolled into base rates effective with bills rendered on or after august  potomac edison was not required to refund to customers the over recovered fuel balance of  a fuel rate adjustment credit was also implemented on august   reducing annual fuel revenues by  effective august  the fuel rate adjustment credit dropped to  effective august  the fuel rate adju stment credit will be eliminated 
in addition  potomac edison has agreed to operate and maintain its distribution system in virginia at or above historic levels of service quality and reliability  and  during the default service period  to contract for generation service to be provided to customers at rates set in accordance with the virginia electric utility restructuring act 
on august   potomac edison filed an application with the virginia scc to transfer the hydroelectric assets located within the state of virginia to a subsidiary green valley hydro  llc 
on december   the virginia scc approved the transfer 
on june   potomac edison transferred these assets to green valley hydro  llc and distributed its ownership of green valley hydro  llc to ae 
green valley hydro  llc will become a subsidiary of the yet to be formed parent holding company of ae supply 
all virginia utilities were required to submit a restructuring plan by january   to be effective on january  accordingly  potomac edison filed phase ii of its functional separation plan with the virginia scc on december  on december   the virginia scc approved the plan 
customer choice was implemented for all virginia customers in potomac edison s service territory beginning on january  on november   the maryland psc approved the power sales agreement between potomac edison  and ae supply  the winning bidder  covering the sale of the aes warrior run output to the wholesale market for the period january  through december  the aes warrior run cogeneration project was developed under purpa and achieved commercial operation on february  under the terms of the maryland deregulation plan approved in  the revenues from the sale of the aes warrior run output are used to offset the capacity and energy costs potomac edison pays to the aes warrior run cogeneration project before determining amounts to be recovered from maryland customers 
an increase in maryland base rates became effective with bills rendered on or after january  this increase is a result of the phase in of the rate increase included in a settlement agreement approved by the maryland psc in october the settlement agreement includes recognition and dollar for dollar recovery of costs to be incurred from the aes warrior run purpa project 
under the terms of this settlement agreement  potomac edison increased its rates about in each of the years   and a million total revenue increase during through 
the increases were designed to recover additional costs of about million  over the period  for capacity purchases from the aes warrior run project net of alleged overearnings of million for the same period 
the settlement agreement also required that potomac edison share with customers percent of earnings above an percent return on equity for and as a result  percent of the amount above the threshold earnings amount  or million attributable to  was distributed to customers in the form of an earnings sharing credit effective june  through april  an earnings sharing credit of million attributable to was distributed to customers effective september  through january  effective with bills rendered on or after january   there was a decrease in maryland distribution rates 
this decrease or customer choice credit is a result of implementing the rate reductions called for by a settlement agreement approved by the maryland psc in december under the terms of this settlement agreement covering stranded cost quantification mechanism  price protection mechanism and unbundled rates  potomac edison decreased its rates percent for residential customers and 
percent for the majority of commercial and industrial customers 
the customer choice credit will remain in effect until a total of million approximately million annually has been credited to residential customers and a total of million approximately million annually has been credited to commercial and industrial customers 
additionally  since the time the maryland psc approved the rate reductions outlined above  the environmental s urcharge has increased and an electric universal service surcharge has been introduced  both of which must be recovered under potomac edison s distribution rate cap consistent with the settlement agreement 
accordingly  distribution rates have been further reduced by million from the previously approved rates in the settlement agreement 
the distribution rate cap for all customers is effective through west penn in november  the pennsylvania puc approved a settlement agreement between west penn and parties to west penn s restructuring proceeding 
under the terms of the settlement  two thirds of west penn s customers were permitted to choose an alternate generation supplier as of january  the remaining one third of west penn s customers were permitted to do so starting january  the settlement agreement provided for a rate refund from revenue about million via a rate decrease throughout  capped rate provisions and recovery of million of transition costs during the transition period through 
in  west penn issued million of transition bonds to securitize most of the transition costs 
as a result of the securitization of transition costs  west penn is authorized by the pennsylvania puc to collect an intangible transition charge itc to provide revenues to service the transition bonds and the c ompetitive transition charge ctc was correspondingly reduced 
actual ctc revenues billed to customers in  and totaled million  million and million  respectively  net of gross receipts tax and a separate agreement with one customer to accelerate the recovery of ctc 
on november   the pennsylvania puc issued an order authorizing west penn to add the under recovery of its ctc for the year ending july  to the existing under recovery from the previous period 
through july  the company has recorded a regulatory asset of million for the difference in the authorized ctc revenues  adjusted for securitization savings to be shared with customers and the actual transition revenues billed to customers 
the puc also authorized future ctc under recoveries  if any  shall be deferred as a regulatory asset for full and complete recovery 
the november settlement also allowed west penn to transfer its  mw of generating assets at book value to ae supply  which was completed in the pennsylvania department of revenue has increased the gross receipts tax rate from percent to percent for electric distribution companies in the state  including west penn 
the new rate is effective for calendar year state law directs west penn to recover these increased tax charges by means of a state tax adjustment surcharge stas added to customer bills 
on october   west penn filed a request with the pennsylvania puc to recover the increased tax liability of approximately million from ratepayers 
by order entered december   the pennsylvania puc directed west penn to include the stas on customer bills rendered between january  and december  on january   the office of consumer advocate oca filed an appeal of the commission order to the commonwealth court of pennsylvania 
west penn is collecting the tax charges during the pendency of the appeal 
any further commissio n action on this matter is held in abeyance pending the resolution of the oca petition for review in the commonwealth court 
west penn has intervened at commonwealth court in support of the commission s decision 
on march   the commonwealth court granted the pennsylvania puc s motion to dismiss the oca s appeal of the pennsylvania puc s decisions in this matter 
the puc will likely reschedule hearings 
agc agc s rates are set by a formula filed with and previously accepted by the ferc 
the only component that can change is the return on equity roe 
pursuant to a settlement agreement filed with the ferc on april   agc s roe was set at for and will continue at that rate until the time any affected party requests and the commission grants a change 
no party has requested any change 
environmental matters the operations of the allegheny owned facilities  including generating stations  are subject to regulation as to air and water quality  hazardous and solid waste disposal  and other environmental matters by various federal  state  and local authorities 
the generating units now owned by ae supply are subject to the same environmental regulations as they were when owned by the distribution companies 
the cost of meeting known environmental standards is provided in the capital requirements and financing section of this report 
additional legislation or regulatory control requirements have been proposed and  if enacted  will require modifying  supplementing  or replacing equipment at existing stations at substantial additional cost 
air standards allegheny currently meets applicable standards as to particulate emissions at its power stations through high efficiency electrostatic precipitators  cleaned coal  flue gas conditioning  and  at times  reduction of output 
from time to time  minor excursions of stack emission opacity  normal to fossil fuel operations  are experienced and are accommodated by the regulatory process 
allegheny meets current emission standards as to sulfur dioxide so by the use of scrubbers  the burning of low sulfur coal  the purchase of cleaned coal to lower the sulfur content  and the blending of low sulfur with higher sulfur coal 
the clean air act amendments of caaa  among other things  require an annual reduction in total utility emissions within the united states of million tons of so and two million tons of nitrogen oxides nox from emission levels  to be completed in two phases  phase i and phase ii 
five coal fired allegheny plants were affected in phase i  and the remaining plants were affected in phase ii 
in an effort to introduce market forces into pollution control  the caaa created so emission allowances 
an allowance is defined as an authorization to emit one ton of so into the atmosphere 
subject to regulatory limitations  allowances may be sold or banked for future use or sale 
allegheny received  through an industry allowance pooling agreement  a total of approximately  bonus and extension allowances during phase i 
these allowances were in addition to the caaa table a allowances that the allegheny subsidiaries received of approximately  per year during the phase i years 
beginning in  for phase ii  allegheny has received and will continue to receive approximately  allowances per year 
as part of its compliance strategy  allegheny continues to study and  where appropriate  participate in the allowance market  making sales or purchases of allowances or participating in certain derivative or hedging allowance transactions 
installation of scrubbers at the harrison power station was the strategy undertaken by allegheny to meet the required so emission reductions for phase i 
allegheny estimates that its banked allowances will allow it to economically comply with phase ii so limits through  and possibly beyond 
studies are ongoing to evaluate cost effective options to comply with phase ii so limits  including those available in connection with the emission allowance trading market 
burner modifications at most of the allegheny operated stations satisfy the nox emission reduction requirements for the acid rain title iv provisions of the caaa 
additional nox reductions  which will require some selective catalytic reduction scr or other post combustion control technologies  are being mandated in maryland  pennsylvania  and west virginia for ozone nonattainment title i reasons 
continuous emission mon itoring equipment has been installed on all phase i and phase ii units 
title i of the caaa established an ozone transport commission otc  which determined that utilities within the northeast ozone transport region otr  including maryland and pennsylvania  would be required to make additional nox reductions in order for the otr to meet the ozone national ambient air quality standards naaqs 
under terms of a memorandum of understanding mou among the otr states  allegheny operated stations located in maryland and pennsylvania were required to reduce nox emissions by approximately from the baseline emissions  with a compliance date of may previously installed nox controls on allegheny s maryland and pennsylvania generating plants allowed allegheny to meet this compliance goal  and are expected to maintain the reduction requirement through the year in october  the epa issued a nox state implementation plan sip call rule that required the equivalent of a uniform lb mmbtu emission rate throughout a state region  including maryland  pennsylvania  and west virginia  beginning may the epa s nox sip call regulation has been under litigation  but on march   the dc circuit court of appeals issued a decision that upheld the regulation 
however  the court did issue a subsequent order on august   that postponed the initial compliance date of the nox sip call from may to may an appeal of the march  court decision before the us supreme court was denied in march during  pennsylvania and maryland promulgated final rules to implement the epa s nox sip call requirements beginning may maryland and pennsylvania are not expected to delay this implementation date  nor are they legally required to do so 
d uring  the west virginia department of environmental protection issued a final rule to implement the epa s nox sip call requirements beginning may the wv nox sip call rule requires approval by the state legislature  which is anticipated during the session 
allegheny s compliance with such stringent regulations will require the installation of expensive post combustion control technologies on most of its power stations 
in august  eight northeastern states filed petitions in connection with section of the caaa with the epa requesting the immediate imposition of up to an nox reduction from utilities located in the midwest and southeast west virginia included 
the petitions claim nox emissions from these upwind sources are preventing their attainment of the ozone standard 
in may  the epa issued a technical approval of the petitions and in december  granted final approval of four of the petitions 
the section petition rulemaking was also under litigation  but a court decision in may  basically upheld the rule 
however  the original may compliance date for the section rule is likely to be postponed to may  as a result of a court order issued in august allegheny s compliance plan for the section petition rulemaking would be the same as the nox sip call compliance p lan discussed above 
the epa is required by law to regularly review the naaqs for criteria pollutants including ozone  particulate  so  and so previous court orders in litigation by the american lung association have expedited these reviews 
the epa in decided not to revise the so and so standards 
revisions to particulate matter pm and ozone standards were promulgated by the epa in july litigation over the revised particulate matter and ozone standards has recently been resolved and these requirements could impose substantial costs on allegheny 
also  in may  the epa promulgated final regional haze regulations to improve visibility in class i federal areas national parks and wilderness areas 
the epa regional haze regulation is under litigation 
the effect on allegheny of these standards or regulations is unknown at this time  but could be substantial 
in  the west virginia air pollution control commission approved the construction of a third party cogeneration facility in the vicinity of rivesville  west virginia 
emissions impact modeling for that facility raised concerns about the compliance of monongahela s rivesville station with ambient standards for so pursuant to a consent order  monongahela agreed to collect on site meteorological data and conduct additional dispersion modeling in order to demonstrate compliance 
the modeling study and a compliance strategy recommending construction of a new good engineering practices gep stack were submitted to the west virginia department of environmental protection wvdep in june costs associated with the gep stack are approximately million 
monongahela is awaiting action by the wvdep 
under an epa approved consent order with pennsylvania  west penn completed construction of a gep stack at the armstrong power station in at a cost of more than million with the expectation that the epa s reclassification of armstrong county to attainment status under naaqs for so would follow 
as a result of the revision of its stack height rules  the epa refused to reclassify the area to attainment status 
subsequently  west penn filed an appeal with the us court of appeals for the third circuit for review of that decision as well as a petition for reconsideration with the epa 
in  the court dismissed west penn s appeal  stating it could not decide the case while west penn s request for reconsideration before the epa was pending 
west penn cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding 
in march  the epa released its utility air toxics report to congress 
the report itself did not recommend regulatory controls 
however  in december  the epa did make a determination for the regulatory controls of power plant mercury emissions 
the regulatory determination did not include any recommendations regarding the level or timing of reductions 
however  the epa plans to issue a proposed rule by december  and a final rule by december based on this schedule  it is unlikely implementation of mercury controls would be required before the kyoto protocol  signed by the clinton administration but not ratified by the us senate  would require drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the united states in response to the threat of global warming 
if ratified and implemented  this treaty likely would require extensive mitigation efforts on the part of allegheny to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at electric generation plants and would raise considerable uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels as an energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities 
while the bush administration has rejected the kyoto protocol  other developed countries in the world are expected to ratify it and abide by its terms beginning in the pressure on the us to join the rest of the world in reducing greenhouse gas emissions is expected to continue and increase both internationally and domestically 
allegheny has taken numerous voluntary  precautionary steps to address the issue of global climate change 
many uncertainties remain in the global climate change debate  including the relative contributions of human activities and natural processes  the extremely high potential costs of extensive mitigation efforts  and the significant economic and social disruptions  which may result from a large scale reduction in the use of fossil fuels 
still  allegheny has taken the initiative to move forward by undertaking its own voluntary program and will continue to explore cost effective opportunities to improve efficiency and performance 
allegheny signed a memorandum of understanding with the doe in to participate in the climate challenge 
as part of this agreement  allegheny supports the climate challenge initiatives in cooperation with other companies through eei 
the ultimate outcome of the global climate change debate and the kyo to protocol could have a significant effect on the industry in general and on allegheny in particular 
allegheny also participates in an active climate related research program and is responsive to the voluntary guidelines suggested in the national energy policy act of  under section b directed toward reducing  controlling  avoiding and sequestering greenhouse gases 
allegheny has taken steps to reduce greenhouse gases and help stimulate a business climate that encourages improved efficiency  performance  electrical loss reductions and cost effectiveness 
water standards under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes  permits for all of allegheny s stations and disposal sites are in place and all facilities are compliant with all permit terms  conditions and effluent limitations 
however  as permits are renewed  more stringent permit limitations are often applied 
thus far allegheny has either successfully developed and scientifically justified  to the satisfaction of the regulatory agencies  alternate site specific water quality criteria or has installed passive constructed wetland treatment technology  thus avoiding significant capital costs and potential liabilities of advanced wastewater treatment 
however  there is significant activity at the federal level on clean water act cwa issues 
there are pending rulemakings  for example  regarding the total maximum daily load tmdl program  water quality standards  antidegradation review  human health and aquatic life water quality criteria  and mixing zones and cwa section b cooling water intake structure 
in addition  the epa is developing new policies concerning protection of endangered species under the cwa and imposition of new cwa requirements to address sediment and biological water quality criteria contamination 
the outcome of these rulemakings will fundamentally change the traditional water quality management program from a chemical specific control of point sources to comprehensive and integrated watershed management 
this regulatory shift will result in more restrictions on facility discharges as well as nonpoint source runoff resulting from land use practices such as agriculture and forest ry and will ultimately address water quality impairment caused by atmospheric deposition 
over the past several years tmdls have become a significant issue because of successful legal challenges to the epa s treatment of tmdls under the cwa in various states 
resulting consent orders in west virginia and pennsylvania require development and implementation of waste loads for point sources and load allocations for nonpoint sources on numerous water bodies not currently meeting water quality standards within a relatively short time frame twelve years 
because of the scientific complexity of the issue  paucity of water quality data  the resource limitations of the state agencies as well as political considerations  it is likely that resulting tmdls will require a disproportionate reduction in point source versus nonpoint source discharges 
the direct result of the tmdls will be further reductions in the amount of pollutants permitted to be discharged by allegheny owned power stations located on water quality impaired rivers 
in directly  tmdl s can adversely affect allegheny by prohibiting new or increased discharges and curtailing the wastewater discharges of its industrial customers 
on july   the epa finalized a rule that modifies the way states are required to develop and implement the tmdl provisions of the cwa 
the rule drew widespread criticism from the regulated community  environmental organizations  governors  and state regulators  primarily because it usurps state authority  lacks a sound scientific basis and requires states to develop and implement a complex program in a short time frame with inadequate federal support 
congress responded to the criticism by placing a provision in a supplemental appropriations bill prohibiting the epa from implementing the rule until october in january the bush administration remanded the rule to epa for reconsideration 
on june  the national academy of sciences released a report requested by congress that recommended a number of changes to epa s tmdl program 
as a result  the epa has proposed to delay by months the effective date of the rule april and to revise the date on which the states are required to submit their next list of impaired waters from april  to october  in the interim  the epa has undertaken an open and active solicitation of stakeholder input and plans to re propose the tmdl rule in october  it is likely that water quality trading provisions will be incorporated into the rule as an innovative means to assist states in more cost effectively implementing tmdls 
the full effect of the rule on allegheny and its customers will not be known until the final rule is promulgated and the states complete tmdl development and implementation on im paired waters over the next years 
in the meantime the states continue to develop tmdls under the existing rule and in response allegheny is proactively working with a number of watershed tmdl stakeholder groups  state agencies and the epa to ensure development of sound and equitable tmdls 
in january  the hudson riverkeeper and other environmental groups filed suit against the epa to force the agency to promulgate rules that would minimize environmental impact from cooling water intake structures 
section b of the cwa requires that cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available bta for minimizing adverse environmental impacts 
after several amendments  the resulting consent decree divides the rulemaking into three phases phase applies to new facilities that employ a cooling water intake structure 
the proposal was promulgated in june and the final rule was published december  phase pertains to existing utilities and non utility power producers that currently employ a cooling water intake structure  and whose flow exceeds a minimum threshold to be determined by the epa 
the rule is expected to be published in the federal register in march with final action taken by august phase will govern existing facilities that employ a cooling water intake structure not covered by the phase rule pulp and paper  chemical plants  etc 
and whose intake flow exceeds a minimum threshold that will be determined by the epa 
the proposal is due by june with final action in december the phase new facility rule applies to all new generation that begins construction after january  it requires cooling towers for all new power plants in addition to limits on intake velocity  percentage of the waterbody used  and  in most cases  additional intake screens or other protective measures largely unspecified but probably including fine mesh screens  wedgewire screens or fabric barriers along with extensive site specific study and monitoring requirements 
if the proposal stands  new facilities will suffer severe siting restrictions  and will be subject to costly environmental studies and time delays to accomplish the studies 
moreover  the precedent setting impact the new facility rule would have on existing facilities could be significant  potentially requiring additional environmental studies and possibly even the installation of cooling towers on those facilities that are shown to be causing an adverse envi ronmental impact 
additionally  specific units could be forced to accept overall flow volume and velocity restrictions in water usage that could lead to derating units and undesirable energy supply reductions 
due to the concerns stated above as well as the precedent setting potential on the forthcoming existing facility rule  the utility water act group filed a petition for review of the new facility rule with the dc circuit court of appeals 
as expected  several environmental groups also filed suit on the rule in the second circuit court of appeals 
because multiple parties have brought litigation on the same rule  the lawsuit will be consolidated in one of the circuit courts by means of random selection 
after significant political debate the epa lowered the maximum contaminant level mcl drinking water standard for arsenic from to ug l to become effective february because arsenic is a naturally occurring trace element present in the earth s crust as well as in coal and coal combustion products and because mcl s are used in other regulatory programs such as groundwater protection  hazardous waste classification and brownfield cleanup programs there is potential that allegheny may incur increased compliance costs as these regulatory programs adopt the new standard 
the full effect of this action on allegheny will not be known until it is determined how the various federal and or state regulatory programs implement the new standard 
hazardous and solid wastes pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act of rcra and the hazardous and solid waste management amendments of  the epa regulates the disposal of hazardous and solid waste materials 
maryland  ohio  pennsylvania  virginia  and west virginia have also enacted hazardous and solid waste management regulations that are as stringent as or more stringent than the corresponding epa regulations 
allegheny is in a continual process of either permitting new or re permitting existing disposal capacity to meet future disposal needs 
all disposal facilities are currently operated in material compliance with their permits 
in addition to using coal combustion by products ccbs in various power plant applications such as scrubber by product stabilization at the harrison and mitchell power stations  ae supply on its own behalf and on behalf of monongahela the only distribution company still owning generation  continues to expand its efforts to market ccbs for beneficial applications and thereby reduce landfill requirements 
in  ae supply and monongahela received approximately  from the external sale and utilization of approximately  tons of fly ash   tons of bottom ash and  tons of boiler slag  and  tons of flue gas desulfurization fgd material 
these ccbs were beneficially used in applications such as cement replacement in ready mix concrete  anti skid materials  grit blasting material  mine reclamation  mine subsidence  structural fills  synthetic gypsum for wallboard production  and grouting of mines and oil wells 
ae supply and monongahela completed the construction of a processing plant that converts the flue gas desulfurization by product from the pleasants power station into a commercial grade synthetic gypsum material to be used in the manufacture of wallboard 
this process has significantly reduced the amount of the by product going to an impoundment 
the processing plant went into commercial production in production problems have limited the quantity of gypsum produced to well below expected production in and new equipment installed in late is expected to bring production closer to originally expected production  but still below the contractually required production 
because the gypsum customer contracted for a minimum annual quantity  penalties have been incurred for these two years totaling approximately million 
the customer has agreed to carry this charge  accepting payment in material through at least  and has indicated a desire to renegotiate the required minimum annual quantity to avoid future production shortfall penalties 
approximately million of this penalty has been offset through via material exchange  leaving million in unpaid penalties as of december  potomac edison received a notice from the maryland department of the environment mde in regarding a remediation ordered under maryland law at a facility previously owned by potomac edison 
the mde has identified potomac edison as a potentially responsible party under maryland law 
remediation is being implemented by the current owner of the facility which is located in frederick 
it is not anticipated that potomac edison s share of remediation costs  if any  will be substantial 
the distribution companies are also among a group of potentially responsible parties under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla  for the jack s creek sitkin smelting superfund site and the butler tunnel superfund site in pennsylvania 
see item legal proceedings for a description of these superfund cases 
regulation allegheny is subject to the broad jurisdiction of the sec under puhca 
the distribution companies are regulated as to substantially all of their operations by regulatory commissions in the states in which they operate 
these companies and ae supply s unregulated generation are also regulated as to various aspects of their business by the ferc 
in addition  they are subject to numerous other local  state  and federal laws  regulations  and rules 
in june  the sec published its report  which recommended changes to puhca  including a recommendation to congress to repeal the entire act 
bills have been introduced in the congress to repeal puhca  but have not passed 
allegheny cannot predict what changes  if any  will be made to puhca as a result of these activities 
in  the distribution companies continued to take part in and fund various programs to assist low income customers  customers with special needs  and customers experiencing temporary financial hardship 
item properties substantially all of the properties of monongahela and potomac edison are held subject to the lien of indentures securing their first mortgage bonds 
in many cases  the properties of monongahela  potomac edison  west penn and ae supply may be subject to certain reservations  minor encumbrances  and title defects which do not materially interfere with their use 
some of the properties are also subject to a second lien securing certain solid waste disposal and pollution control notes 
the indenture under which agc s unsecured debentures and medium term notes are issued prohibits agc  with certain limited exceptions  from incurring or permitting liens to exist on any of its properties or assets unless the debentures and medium term notes are contemporaneously secured equally and ratably with all other indebtedness secured by such lien 
transmission and distribution lines  in substantial part  some substation s and switching stations  and some ancillary facilities at power stations are on lands of others  in some cases by sufferance  but in most instances pursuant to leases  easements  rights of way  permits or other arrangements  many of which have not been recorded and some of which are not evidenced by formal grants 
in some cases  no examination of titles has been made as to lands on which transmission and distribution lines and substations are located 
each of the distribution companies possesses the power of eminent domain with respect to its public utility operations

in addition to its production assets  mgs owns approximately miles of high pressure transmission facilities running from jackson county  west virginia  west to huntington cabell county  west virginia  where it terminates at various delivery locations into the facilities of mountaineer  columbia gas  and the industrial plant facilities of various industrial end users  and approximately miles of gathering lines located in the same general vicinity 
item 
legal proceedings as of february   monongahela has been named as a defendant along with multiple other defendants in a total of  pending asbestos cases involving one or more plaintiffs 
potomac edison and west penn have been named as defendants along with multiple other defendants in approximately one half of those cases 
because these cases are filed in a shotgun format wherein multiple plaintiffs file claims against multiple defendants in the same case  it is presently impossible to determine the actual number of cases in which plaintiffs make claims against the distribution companies 
however  based upon past experience and available data  it may be estimated that about one third of the total number of cases filed actually involve claims against any or all of the distribution companies 
all complaints allege that the plaintiffs sustained unspecified injuries resulting from claimed exposure to asbestos in various generating plan ts and other industrial facilities operated by the various defendants  although all plaintiffs do not claim exposure at facilities operated by all defendants 
with very few exceptions  plaintiffs claiming exposure at stations operated by the distribution companies were employed by third party contractors  not by the distribution companies 
three plaintiffs are known to be either present or former employees of monongahela 
each plaintiff generally seeks compensatory and punitive damages against all defendants in amounts of up to million and million  respectively  in those cases which include a spousal claim for loss of consortium damages are generally sought against all defendants in an amount of up to an additional million 
a total of  cases have been previously settled and or dismissed against monongahela for an amount substantially less than the anticipated cost of defense 
while the distribution companies believe that all of the cases are without merit  they cannot predict the outcome no r are they able to determine whether additional cases will be filed 
on january   allegheny filed a declaratory judgment action in the court of common pleas of westmoreland county  pa  against its historic comprehensive general liability cgl insurers 
this suit sought a declaration that the cgl insurers have a duty to defend and indemnify the distribution companies in the asbestos cases  as well as in certain environmental actions 
four insurers have settled since the filing of this action 
another defendant was dismissed as a party 
the declaratory judgment action may be re filed against that party in a different venue 
settlements from other insurance carriers are also being actively pursued 
the final outcome of such proceedings  however  cannot be predicted 
on march   the distribution companies received notice that the epa had identified them as potentially responsible parties prps under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended  with respect to the jack s creek sitkin smelting superfund site site 
there are approximately other prps involved 
a remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs prepared by the epa originally indicated remedial alternatives  which ranged as high as million  to be shared by all responsible parties 
a prp group consisting of approximately members  and to which the distribution companies belong  has been formed and has submitted an addendum to the ri fs  which proposes a substantially less expensive cleanup remedy 
in  the prp group entered into a consent order with the epa to remediate the site 
a final determination has not been made for the distribution companies share of the remediation costs 
however  at this time it is estimated that the effect on the distribution companies will not be material 
on october   potomac edison received a questionnaire from the epa concerning a release or threat of release of hazardous substances  pollutants  or contaminants into the environment at the butler tunnel site located in luzerne county  pa 
potomac edison notified the epa that it has no records or recollection of any business relations with the site or any of the companies identified in the questionnaire 
it is not possible to determine at this time what effect  if any  this matter may have on potomac edison 
in  national steel corporation national steel filed suit against ae and certain subsidiaries in the circuit court of hancock county  w 
va  alleging damages of approximately million as a result of an order issued by the west virginia psc requiring curtailment of national steel s use of electric power during the united mine workers strike of a jury verdict in favor of ae and the subsidiaries was rendered in june national steel has filed a motion for a new trial  which is still pending before the circuit court of hancock county 
ae and the subsidiaries believe the motion is without merit  however  they cannot predict the outcome of this case 
the attorney general of the state of new york and the attorney general of the state of connecticut  in letters dated september   and november   respectively  notified ae of their intent to commence civil actions against ae and or its subsidiaries alleging violations at the fort martin power station under the federal clean air act  which requires power plants that make major modifications to comply with the same emission standards applicable to new power plants 
other governmental agencies may commence similar actions in the future 
fort martin is located in west virginia and is now jointly owned by ae supply and monongahela 
both attorneys general stated their intent to seek injunctive relief and penalties 
in addition  the attorney general of the state of new york indicated that he may assert claims under the state common law of public nuisance seeking to recover  among other things  compensation for alleged environmental damage caused in n ew york by the operation of the fort martin power station 
at this time  ae and its subsidiaries are not able to determine what effect  if any  these actions may have on them 
on august   ae received a letter from the epa requiring it to provide certain information on the following ten electric generating stations albright  armstrong  fort martin  harrison  hatfield s ferry  mitchell  pleasants  rivesville  r 
paul smith and willow island 
ae supply and monongahela own these electric generating stations 
the letter requested information under section of the federal clean air act to determine compliance with federal clean air act and state implementation plan requirements  including potential application of the new source performance standards  which can require the installation of additional air pollution control equipment upon the major modification of an existing facility 
similar inquiries have been made of other electric utilities and have resulted in enforcement proceedings being brought in some cases 
ae believes its subsidiaries generating facilities have been operated in accordance with the clean air act and the rules implementing that act 
the experience of other utilities  however  suggests that in recent years  the epa may have revised its interpretation of the rules regarding the determination of whether an action at a facility constitutes routine maintenance  which would not trigger the requirements of the new source performance standards  or a major modification of the facility  which would require compliance with the new source performance standards 
section information requests concerning facility modifications are often followed by enforcement actions 
at this time  ae is not able to determine what effect  if any  the epa s inquiry may have on its operations 
if new source performance standards are applied to allegheny generating stations  in addition to the possible imposition of fines  compliance would entail significant expenditures 
in june  monongahela was contacted by the us environmental protection agency epa and the environmental enforcement section of the department of justice doj concerning the release of approximately  gallons of non pcb oil to the environment  following the catastrophic failure of a mva  kv transformer on april   at monongahela s belmont substation 
monongahela informed the epa and the doj that it responded to this release immediately  thereby preventing any of the oil from reaching major waterways 
monongahela also informed the federal agencies that it has been working in conjunction with west virginia division of environmental protection regarding site cleanup and remediation 
monongahela reached an agreement with the epa through the doj resolving the agency s concerns in november of  and the united states district court for the northern district of west virginia accepted the consent decree  which the parties entered in f ebruary monongahela agreed to install additional piping  automatic valves and pumps at the substation to prevent any oil which may leak from the equipment from leaving the property 
in addition  monongahela agreed to pay a civil penalty in the amount of on december   nevada power company filed a complaint with the federal energy regulatory commission against ae supply  alleging that the prices in three power sale contracts negotiated between december  and february   all of which were for power sales during  were the product of markets found by the commission to be dysfunctional and not competitive  and therefore unjust and unreasonable 
nevada power company asked the commission to determine and fix the just and reasonable prices consistent with the mitigated prices already established by the commission for the western market 
nevada power company filed substantially identical complaints against a number of other suppliers 
on december   ae supply filed an answer to the complaint  requesting summary denial of the complaint because nevada power company had no contract with ae supply  because it had negotiated the power sale contracts at issue with merrill lynch capital se rvices  inc before ae supply acquired merrill lynch s wholesale power trading business  and the contracts had not yet been assigned to ae supply  and nevada power company s claim for relief was fatally flawed in a number of respects 
while ae supply believes the complaint is without merit  it cannot predict the outcome of this litigation 
on february  nevada power company filed an answer and ae supply responded on march  on february   the california puc and the caeob filed a complaint with the ferc against ae supply and a number of other suppliers 
the capuc s complaint requested that each of the contracts challenged in the complaint be abrogated  as containing both unreasonable pricing and unjust and unreasonable non price terms and conditions  or  in the alternative  that the challenged contracts be reformed to provide for just and reasonable pricing  reduce their duration  and strike from the contracts the specific non price contract terms and conditions found to be unjust and unreasonable 
the caeob s complaint requested that the contracts be voidable at the state s option  abrogated  or reformed 
on march   ae supply filed its answer to the capuc and caeob complaints  in which it requested that the complaints be expeditiously denied 
while ae supply believes the complaints are without merit  it cannot predict the outcome of this litigation 
on march   the attorney general of the state of california filed a complaint with the ferc alleging that various named and unnamed sellers of electric energy in california violated the federal power act by failing properly to file with the ferc the terms of their short term power sales to the california independent system operator  the california power exchange and the cdwr 
the complaint asks the ferc  among other things  to require the sellers under these transactions to pay refunds with interest for their short term power sales during and the complaint does not specifically name ae supply  although ae supply did make short term power sales in california during at this time  it is not possible to determine what effect  if any  this action may have on ae supply

overview the company is a diversified utility holding company  which has experienced significant changes in its business as a result of the deregulation of electric generation in states where its subsidiaries operate 
as deregulation of electric generation has been implemented  the company s subsidiaries have transferred their generating assets  excluding monongahela power company s monongahela power west virginia jurisdictional generating assets  from their regulated utility businesses to an affiliated  unregulated generation business in accordance with approved deregulation plans 
as a result of the deregulation activities  the company has aligned its businesses into three principal business segments 
the unregulated generation operations segment consists primarily of the company s subsidiary  allegheny energy supply company  llc allegheny energy supply 
allegheny energy supply is an unregulated energy supply company that develops  owns  operates  and controls electric generating capacity and supplies and trades energy and energy related commodities in selected domestic retail and wholesale markets 
allegheny energy supply manages the company s generating assets as an integral part of its wholesale marketing  energy trading  fuel procurement  and risk management activities 
the regulated utility operations segment consists primarily of the company s subsidiaries monongahela power  including its subsidiary  mountaineer gas company mountaineer gas  the potomac edison company potomac edison  and west penn power company west penn 
the regulated utility operations segment operates electric and natural gas transmission and distribution t d systems 
it also generates electric energy for its west virginia jurisdiction  where deregulation of electric generation has not been implemented 
the other unregulated operations segment consists of allegheny ventures  inc allegheny ventures  an unregulated subsidiary  which invests in and develops fiber and data services and energy related projects and provides energy consulting and management services and natural gas and other energy related services 
on july   the company filed a u application with the securities and exchange commission sec  seeking authorization under the public utility holding company act of puhca to effect an initial public offering ipo of up to percent of the common stock in a new holding company  which would own percent of allegheny energy supply  and then distribute the remaining common stock owned by the company to its shareholders on a tax free basis 
in october  the company announced that the proposed ipo would be delayed due to market and other conditions 
in january  the company announced that it would not proceed with the ipo 
in february  the company filed an amendment to the u application filed on july   with the sec  withdrawing its ipo application

the company also experienced several significant events that could not be associated with one particular segment 
see other events on page m for additional details regarding these significant events 
significant events in   and unregulated generation transfer  development  and acquisition of generating assets and generating capacity the table below summarizes the company s electric generating capacity  which was in operation on december   including generating capacity purchased through contractual obligations of which the company does not exercise percent control  along with announced construction and development  contractual control  and planned expansions capacity in megawatts in operation unregulated generation regulated utility announced construction and development  contractual control  and planned expansions unregulated generation total the preceding table does not include purchases of generating capacity from qualifying facilities under the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa representing approximately megawatts mw 
these power purchases are either used by the company s regulated utility subsidiaries to fulfill their service obligations or are sold by the company s regulated utility subsidiaries into the wholesale market 
m allegheny energy  inc 
the unregulated generation operations segment  as part of its generating asset and energy commodity portfolio  manages the interface between the company s electric generating capacity and various customers or markets 
in early  dispatch arrangements were put in place between regulated utility operations and unregulated generation operations 
with these arrangements  regulated utility operations sells the amount of its bulk power that exceeds its regulated load to allegheny energy supply and conversely buys generation from unregulated generation operations when regulated load exceeds regulated utility operations bulk power 
such a relationship allows all of the company s generation to be dispatched in a more efficient manner 
the two sections that follow provide the details regarding the generating asset transfers from regulated utility operations to unregulated generation operations and the acquisition and development of generating assets and capacity by unregulated generation operations 
transfer of generating assets on june   monongahela power transferred its mw of ohio and federal energy regulatory commission ferc jurisdictional generating assets to allegheny energy supply at net book value 
on august   potomac edison transferred approximately  mw of its maryland  virginia  and west virginia jurisdictional generating assets to allegheny energy supply at net book value 
potomac edison s five mw of virginia hydroelectric assets will be transferred to allegheny energy supply in during the fourth quarter of  west penn transferred its jurisdictional generating assets  which totaled  mw  to allegheny energy supply at net book value 
the relevant state commissions  the ferc  and the sec approved these transfers 
the generating asset transfers from monongahela power  west penn  and potomac edison included their percent ownership interest in allegheny generating company agc 
in addition  west penn and potomac edison also transferred their entitlement to mw of capacity in the ohio valley electric corporation ovec 
under the terms of the deregulation plans approved in pennsylvania for west penn  in maryland for potomac edison  and in ohio for monongahela power  these companies retain the obligation to provide electricity to customers who do not choose an alternate electricity supplier during a transition period 
for west penn s customers  the pennsylvania transition period continues through december  for residential customers of potomac edison in maryland  the transition period continues through december  for commercial and industrial customers of potomac edison in maryland  the transition period continues through december  for monongahela power  the transition period for ohio residential and small commercial customers continues through december   and  for all other ohio customers  through december  the default service obligation for potomac edison in virginia may be eliminated after july   if the virginia state corporation commission virginia scc determines there is sufficient competition 
in any event  after termination of capped rates  the rates for default service in virginia will be based upon competitive market prices for generation services 
pursuant to contracts  allegheny energy supply provides west penn  potomac edison  and monongahela power with energy during the pennsylvania  maryland  and ohio transition periods  respectively 
allegheny energy supply also provides energy and capacity to serve retail load in potomac edison s west virginia service territory  pursuant to a facilities lease and power supply agreement 
the facilities lease covers the first mw of retail load in the territory  with the power supply agreement covering deliveries over mw 
the facilities lease term is annual  with automatic renewal provisions 
the term of the power supply agreement is the later of december   or years after the implementation of retail electric competition in west virginia 
allegheny energy supply provides energy pursuant to a contract to cover the retail load of potomac edison in virginia during a capped rate period that ends on july   unless the virginia scc reduces this time period 
under these contracts  allegheny ene rgy supply provides these regulated electric distribution affiliates with the amount of electricity  up to their retail load  that they may require 
these contracts currently represent a significant portion of the normal operating capacity of allegheny energy supply s fleet of transferred generating assets 
allegheny energy supply may need to absorb changes in fuel prices and increased costs of environmental compliance  since the price of energy supplied to the regulated electric distribution affiliates may not correspond to higher company specific costs 
in march  the west virginia legislature passed house resolution approving an electric deregulation plan submitted by the public service commission of west virginia west virginia psc  with certain modifications 
under the resolution  the implementation of the west virginia deregulation plan cannot occur until the legislature enacts certain tax changes regarding the preservation of tax revenues for state and local governments and other changes conforming to the plan and authorizing implementation 
the plan provides for all customers to have choice of an electric generation supplier and allows monongahela power to transfer the west virginia portion approximately  mw of owned capacity and mw of capacity from generating units over which the company does not exercise percent control of its generating assets to allegheny energy supply at net book value 
no final legislative action was taken in regarding implementation of the deregulation plan 
although the west virginia legislature m ay m allegheny energy  inc 
reconsider the deregulation plan in the january to march session  the current climate regarding restructuring makes it unlikely that the existing plan will be advanced in on june   the west virginia psc issued an order regarding the transfer of the generating assets of monongahela power 
the june   order permits monongahela power to submit a petition to the west virginia psc  seeking approval to transfer its west virginia jurisdictional generating assets prior to the implementation of the deregulation plan 
a filing before implementation of the deregulation plan is required to include commitments to the consumer and other protections contained in the deregulation plan 
on august   with a supplemental filing on october   monongahela power filed a petition  seeking west virginia psc approval to transfer its west virginia jurisdictional generating assets to allegheny energy supply 
settlement discussions regarding the generating asset transfer are ongoing

global energy markets acquisition on march   allegheny energy supply acquired global energy markets  the energy commodity marketing and trading business of merrill lynch 
allegheny energy supply acquired this business for million plus the issuance of a percent equity membership interest 
the acquired business helps the company optimize its portfolio of generating assets by significantly enhancing its wholesale marketing  energy trading  fuel procurement  market analysis  and risk management activities on a nationwide basis 
this business provides the company with valuable market intelligence to help it better identify opportunities to expand its acquisition and development activities and to compete outside of its traditional regions 
as discussed above  the acquisition included a long term contractual right to call up to  mw of generating capacity in southern california 
see notes e and s to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the acq uisition 
long term power sales agreement the company s acquisition of merrill lynch s energy trading business included the long term contractual right to call up to  mw of natural gas fired generating capacity in southern california and related hedges 
shortly after acquiring this energy trading business  the company evaluated the long term and short term risks associated with this portfolio in order to construct a prudent risk mitigation strategy 
the company concluded that the most significant risk was the changing relationship between electricity and natural gas prices over time and the resulting effects on the value of the company s contractual right to call up to  mw of generating capacity 
in the short term  unusually high prices and volatility in the electricity and natural gas markets were expected to continue 
given the prevailing levels of volatility in the electricity and natural gas markets and the company s contractual right to call up to  mw of generating capacity  the company i mplemented a hedging strategy 
accordingly  on march   the company closed a substantial part of its long position by entering into a power sales agreement with the california department of water resources cdwr  the electricity buyer for the state of california 
the agreement is for a period through december under this agreement  allegheny energy supply has committed to supply california with contract volumes varying from mw to mw through december for the last seven years of the contract  the contract volume will be fixed at  mw 
the contract contains a fixed price of per megawatt hour 
m allegheny energy  inc 
the company remained concerned about the forward cost of natural gas and spot prices for electricity in california and the net position of the contractual right to call up to  mw of generating capacity 
consequently  the company entered into a series of forward purchases of electricity through designed to hedge these risks 
while these forward purchases were made at then market prices  the prices paid for these forward purchases exceeded the contractual price of the cdwr agreement 
as a result  the cdwr agreement and related forward purchase hedges have negatively affected the company s cash flows since march while this hedging strategy will result in short term cash outflows through  the total projected cash flows remain significantly positive 
this hedging strategy is performing as designed 
in august  allegheny energy supply was the successful bidder to supply baltimore gas and electric company bge with electricity from july through june allegheny energy supply has committed to supply bge with an amount needed to fulfill percent of its provider of last resort obligations

the contracts  which will supply mw of electricity to the boroughs  will run from june through the company records these contracts at their fair value on the consolidated balance sheet  with changes in fair value recorded as a component of unregulated generation revenues on the consolidated statement of operations 
proposed natural gas storage and pipeline project on january   allegheny energy supply announced its participation in an open season process for a proposed natural gas storage and pipeline project the desert crossing gas storage and transportation system which would be located in nevada and arizona 
sponsored by allegheny energy supply  the salt river project  and sempra energy resources  the proposed project would include the development of a billion cubic foot salt cavern storage complex north of kingman  arizona  and an associated north south pipeline  extending approximately miles from near las vegas  nevada  to wenden  in southwest arizona 
if constructed  the project would provide a high deliverability natural gas storage facility and inter connections with major natural gas pipelines in the southwest united states 
it could be a stable source of natural gas supply for allegheny energy supply s proposed  mw la paz generating facility and would provide additional supply and delivery options for allegheny energy supply s existing agreements in las vegas and california 
open season when prospective natural gas shippers may bid for capacity on the project was held from january   through february  in response to the open season  a number of bids were received from potential shippers  reflecting support for the project by the market 
however  many of the bid submissions were not binding due to the inclusion of certain contingency clauses 
in addition  the recent announcement of the cancellation or delay of several development projects for new generating facilities has caused many shippers to express concern over the commitment to a binding bid 
as such  discussions are ongoing with interested parties to determine their level of commitment 
a final decision regarding whether to move forward with the project will be made at the conclusion of the discussions with interested parties 
regulated utility operations rate matters the company s regulated subsidiaries  doing business as allegheny power  operate electric and natural gas t d systems

on october   the maryland psc approved potomac edison s filing  which represented the final reconciliation of its deferred fuel balance 
potomac edison refunded to customers a million overrecovery balance  which existed in the maryland deferred fuel account as of september  the deferred fuel credit to customers began in october and ended in october when the balance fell to zero 
the refund of the overrecovered balance did not affect potomac edison s earnings  since the overrecovered amounts had been deferred 
on june   the west virginia psc approved a joint stipulation and agreement for settlement  stating agreed upon rates designed to make the west virginia rates of potomac edison and monongahela power consistent 
under the terms of the settlement  several tariff schedules  notably those available to residential and small commercial customers  will require several incremental steps to reach the agreed upon rate level 
the settlement rates resulted in a revenue reduction of approximately 
million for  increasing over eight years to an annual reduction of approximately million 
offsetting the decrease in rates  the settlement approved by the west virginia psc directs monongahela power and potomac edison to amortize the existing over collected deferred fuel balance as of june  approximately million  as a reduction of expenses over a four and one half year period beginning july  also  effective july   potomac edison and monongahela power ceased their expanded net energy cost fuel clause as part of the settlement 
in conjunction with the order approving phase i of potomac edison s functional separation plan  the virginia scc approved a memorandum of understanding mou

million 
a fuel rate adjustment credit was also implemented on august   reducing annual fuel revenues by  effective august  the fuel rate adjustment credit dropped to  effective august  the fuel rate adjustment credit will be eliminated 
on november   the maryland psc approved the power sales agreement between potomac edison and the winning bidder covering the sale of the aes warrior run output to the wholesale market for the period january   through december  in november  the maryland psc approved a further power sales agreement between potomac edison and allegheny energy supply  the winning bidder  covering the sale of the aes warrior run output to the wholesale market for the january   through december   period 
the aes warrior run cogeneration project was developed under the purpa and achieved commercial operation on february  under the terms of the maryland deregulation plan approved in  the revenues from the sale of the aes warrior run output are used to offset the capacity and energy costs potomac edison pays to the aes warrior run cogeneration project before determining amounts to be recovered from maryland customers 
effective with bills rendered on or after january   there was an increase in maryland base rates 
this increase was a result of the phase in of the rate increase approved by the maryland psc in october pursuant to a settlement agreement  which includes recognition and dollar for dollar recovery of costs to be incurred from the aes warrior run purpa project 
the maryland psc approved rates to each customer class on december  under the terms of the agreement  potomac edison increased its rates about four percent in each of the years   and a million total revenue increase during through 
the increases were designed to recover additional costs of about million  over the through period  for capacity purchases from the project  net of alleged overearnings of million for the same period 
the agreement also required that potomac edison share with customers percent of earnings above an percent return on equity for and as a re sult  percent of the amount above the threshold earnings amount  or million applicable to  was distributed to customers in the form of an earnings sharing credit  effective june   through april  an earnings sharing credit of million applicable to was distributed to customers from september   through january  effective with bills rendered on or after january   there was a decrease in maryland distribution rates 
this decrease  or customer choice credit  is a result of implementing the rate reductions called for in the settlement agreement approved in december under the terms of the agreement covering stranded cost quantification mechanism  price protection mechanism  and unbundled rates  potomac edison decreased its rates seven percent for residential customers and one half of one percent for the majority of commercial and industrial customers 
the customer choice credit will remain in effect until a total of million approximately million annually has been credited to residential customers and a total of million approximately million annually has been credited to commercial and industrial customers 
additionally  since the time the maryland psc approved the rate reductions outlined above  the environmental surcharge has increased and the electric univer sal surcharge has been introduced  both of which must be recovered under potomac edison s distribution rate cap consistent with the m allegheny energy  inc 
settlement agreement 
accordingly  distribution rates have been further reduced by million from the previously approved rates in the settlement agreement 
the distribution rate cap for all customers is effective through effective january   the pennsylvania department of revenue increased the gross receipts tax rate from percent to percent for electric distribution companies in the state  including west penn 
state law directs west penn to recover these increased tax charges by means of a state tax adjustment surcharge stas added to customer bills 
on october   west penn filed a request with the pennsylvania public utility commission pennsylvania puc to recover the increased tax liability of approximately million from customers 
by an order entered december   the pennsylvania puc directed west penn to include the stas on customer bills rendered between january   and december  on january   the office of consumer advocate oca filed an appeal of the pennsylvania puc order to the commonwealth court of pennsylvania

natural gas on october   the west virginia psc approved an interim increase of the commodity rate for natural gas customers of monongahela power  formerly west virginia power company west virginia power customers  for natural gas service bills rendered on and after december  on december   the west virginia psc approved additional increases for bills rendered on and after january   through november  total revenue increase for the month period of million or percent for the commodity rate 
the commodity rate  or purchased gas adjustment pga rate  is the portion of the bill that reflects the cost of gas  which increased significantly during the west virginia psc approved a tiered rate structure  with rates established for the winter heating season  effective january   through april   and further increased rates effective may   through november   dependent upon the level of cost recovery after the winter heating season 
this approach allowed monongahela power full recovery of these costs  but eased the increase for the average customer 
on october   the west virginia psc approved an interim decrease in the pga rate  effective with bills rendered on and after december   through november  total revenue decrease for the month period of million or percent for the commodity rate 
this approval became final on december  the reduced pga rate is the result of changes in the market price that monongahela power pays for natural gas 
with this adjustment  customers will benefit from recent decreases in natural gas market prices 
these increases and decreases in gas cost recovery revenues have no effect on earnings because they were implemented via the pga mechanism 
under the pga procedure  differences between revenues received for energy costs and actual energy costs are deferred until the next rate proceeding  when energy rates are adjusted to return or recover previous overrecoveries or underrecoveries  respectively 
on january   mountaineer gas filed for a rate increase with the west virginia psc in response to significant increases in the market price for natural gas 
on july   a settlement was reached and a joint stipulation and agreement for settlement was filed with the west virginia psc

the company and pjm have asked the ferc to confirm that pjm west satisfies the ferc s requirements for rtos as set forth in order no 
under the pjm west proposal  the company s regulated utility subsidiaries will transfer operational control over their transmission system to pjm 
the company will adopt pjm s transmission pricing methodology  including pjm s congestion management system 
in addition  pjm will expand its day ahead and real time energy markets to include pjm west 
as a result  energy suppliers will be able to reach consumers anywhere within the expanded pjm pjm west market at a single transmission rate  instead of paying multiple transmission rates as they do today 
m allegheny energy  inc 
the company s filing also requested authorization to recover anticipated lost transmission revenues of approximately million annually and pjm west start up expenses billed to the company by pjm of approximately million annually through by order dated july   the ferc conditionally approved pjm west  subject to a compliance filing clarifying certain terms and conditions of pjm west and providing additional support for the company s claim for lost transmission revenues and start up expenses 
the company and pjm submitted their compliance filing on september on january   the ferc authorized the company and pjm to proceed with pjm west  effective march  the ferc s order set for hearing the question of whether the company had adequately supported its claim to recover anticipated lost transmission revenues and start up expenses  and created uncertainty as to whether the ferc intended to initiate a general investigation into the company s transmission rates  which could potentially lead to an overall reduction to its transmission revenues 
the company requested clarification  and  on march   the ferc issued a further order explaining that its january   order did not initiate a general investigation of the company s transmission revenues 
accordingly  in light of the limited scope of the hearing ordered by the ferc  the company has elected to proceed with pjm west  effective april  the company anticipates the formation of pjm west will enhance its ability to compete for power sales in the expanded pjm pjm west market area

 accounting for energy trading and risk management activities 
at december   the fair value of the company s commodity contracts was a net asset position of million 
the fair value of exchange traded instruments  primarily futures and certain options  was based on actively quoted market prices 
in establishing the fair value of commodity contracts that do not have quoted prices  such as physical forward contracts  over the counter options  and swaps  management uses available market data and pricing models to estimate fair values 
estimating fair values of instruments which do not have quoted market prices requires management s judgment in determining amounts which could reasonably be expected to be received from  or paid to  a third party in settlement of the contracts 
the amounts cou ld be materially different from the amounts that might be realized in an actual sale transaction 
fair values are subject to change in the near term and reflect management s best estimate based on various factors 
in establishing the fair value of commodity contracts  the company makes estimates using available market data and pricing models 
factors such as uncertainty in prices  operational risks related to generating facilities  and risks related to the performance by counterparties are evaluated in establishing the fair value of these contracts

none of monongahela power s ohio customers have switched to another supplier 
at december   less than one percent of west penn s customers and potomac edison s maryland customers chose alternate energy suppliers 
the decrease in choice revenues for and was primarily due to west penn customers who previously chose an alternate energy supplier and then returned to full electric service from west penn at regulated rates

the change in regulated utility operations bulk power for and was primarily due to increased sales between monongahela power and potomac edison and the company s unregulated subsidiary  allegheny energy supply  reflecting the dispatch arrangements that were put in place in early in addition  million for and million for was the result of the sale of the output of the aes warrior run cogeneration facility into the open wholesale market 
this output was part of a maryland psc settlement agreement with potomac edison  allowing full recovery from maryland customers of the purchased power costs incurred by potomac edison related to the aes warrior run facility in excess of the value of the power sold in the open market 
in october  the maryland psc approved a settlement agreement for potomac edison 
under the terms of that agreement  potomac edison increased its rates about four percent in each of the years   and a million total revenue increase during through 
the increases were designed to recover additional costs of about million over the through period for capacity purchases from the aes warrior run cogeneration project  net of alleged overearnings of million for the same period 
regulated electric revenues reflect not only changes in kilowatt hour sales and base rate changes  but also changes in revenues from fuel and energy cost adjustment clauses fuel clauses  which were applicable in all company jurisdictions  except for pennsylvania  through various dates in effective july   potomac edison s maryland jurisdiction and the west virginia jurisdiction for monongahela power and potomac edison ceased to have a fuel clause 
effective august   a fuel clause ceased to exist for potomac edison s virginia jurisdiction 
effective january   a fuel clause ceased to exist for monongahela power s ohio jurisdiction 
where a fuel clause was in effect  changes in fuel revenues had no effect on consolidated net income because increases and decreases in fuel and purchased power costs and sales of transmission services and bulk power were passed on to customers through fuel clauses 
once the fuel clause was eliminated  the company assumed the risks and benefits of changes in fuel and purchased power costs and sales of transmission services and bulk power 
natural gas sales and services and electric revenues from west virginia power and mountaineer gas are included in regulated revenues in and because a significant portion of the natural gas sold by monongahela power s natural gas distribution operations is ultimately used for space heating  both revenues and earnings are subject to seasonal fluctuations 
the pga mechanism continues to exist for west virginia power and came into effect for mountaineer gas following a three year moratorium  which ended on october  see rate matters starting on page m for additional details regarding rate matters for monongahela power and mountaineer gas 
the increase in unregulated generation operations revenues for was primarily due to the results of energy trading activities 
allegheny energy supply has significantly increased the volume and scope of its energy commodity marketing and trading activities 
the company now trades electricity  natural gas  oil  coal  and other energy related commodities 
the company records contracts entered into in connection with energy trading at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet  with all changes in fair value recorded as gains and losses on the consolidated statement of operations in unregulated generation revenues 
the realized revenues from energy trading activities  with the exception of certain financial instruments  including swaps and certain options  are recorded on a gross basis as individual discrete transactions as either revenues or expenses because the contracts require physical delivery of the underlying asset 
fair values for exchange traded instruments  principally futures and certain op tions  are based on actively quoted market prices 
in establishing the fair value of commodity contracts that do not have quoted market prices  such as physical contracts  over the counter options  and swaps  management makes estimates using available market data and pricing models 
the company has certain contracts that are unique  which extend to and beyond  and are valued using proprietary pricing models 
inputs to the models include estimated forward natural gas and power prices  interest rates  estimates of market volatility for natural gas and power prices  the correlation of natural gas and power prices  and other factors such as generating unit availability and location  as appropriate 
these inputs require management judgments and assumptions 
the company s models also adjust the fair value of commodity contracts to reflect uncertainty in prices  operational risks related to generating facilities  and risks related to the performance of counterparties 
these inputs become more challenging  and the models become less precise the further into the future these estimates are made 
actual effects on the company s financial position and results of operations may vary significantly from expected results  if the judgments and assumptions underlying those models inputs prove to be wrong or the models prove to be unreliable 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk on page m for additional information regarding the company s exposure to market risks associated with commodity prices

the company determines prices actively quoted from various industry services  broker quotes  and the new york mercantile exchange nymex 
electricity markets are generally liquid for approximately three years and gas markets are generally liquid for approximately five years 
afterward  some market prices can be observed  but market liquidity is less robust 
approximately billion of the company s commodity contracts were classified as prices based on models even though a portion of these contracts are valued based on observable market prices 
the most significant variable to the company s models used to value these contracts is the forward prices for both electricity and natural gas 
these forward prices are based on observable market prices to the extent prices are available in the market 
generally  electricity forward prices are actively quoted for about three years and some observable market prices are available for about five years 
after five years  the forward prices for electricity are based on the forward price of natural gas and a marginal heat rate for generation based on more efficient natural gas fired generation to convert natural gas into electricity 
for natural gas  forward prices are generally actively quoted for about five years  and some observable market prices are available for about years 
beyond years  natural gas prices are escalated  based on trends in prior years 
for deliveries of less than one year  the fair value of the company s commodity contracts was a net liability of million  primarily related to commodity contracts to hedge the cdwr agreement 
as discussed below  the company expects to incur realized losses related to the contract with the cdwr and related hedges through net unrealized gains of million in and million in were recorded to the consolidated statement of operations in unregulated generation revenues to reflect the change in fair value of the energy commodity contracts

during  the company did not have any changes in the fair value of commodity contracts attributed to changes in valuation techniques 
with regard to the assumptions  the company frequently evaluates availability  correlation  volatility  heat rate  and other factors against market observations and market adjustments 
the effects of these changes cannot be readily separated from the effects of changes in forward prices for electricity and natural gas 
as shown in the table above  the net fair value of the company s commodity contracts increased by million as a result of unrealized gains recorded during the year 
of the unrealized gains  million related to the company s contracts in the western systems coordinating council wscc  including the fixed price contract with the cdwr and the contract to call up to  mw of generating capacity in southern california 
this increase in the fair value of the wscc portfolio was driven by the fixed price contract to sell power for approximately years to the cdwr  which increased in fair value as prices dropped in the wscc during the increase in the fair value of the cdwr contract was partly offset by decreases in the fair value of the contract to call up to  mw of generating capacity in southern california and other contracts primarily used to hedge the wscc portfolio 
during  the company s energy trading activities resulted in million of net realized losses 
these losses were mainly related to the company s contract with the cdwr and the related hedges  which were partially offset by realized gains from the sale of generation from the generating assets acquired in the midwest and from other generation in excess of the power provided to the company s regulated utility subsidiaries to meet their provider of last resort obligations 
due to the existing hedges of the cdwr contract  the company is currently paying for power at prices above the fixed price contract to sell power to the cdwr for reasons discussed under long term power sales agreements starting on page m the company expects to continue to incur realized losses related to the cdwr contract due to the hedges through  but at a reduced level as the hedges mature 
starting with  the company expects to realize gains related to the cdwr contract for the remainder of the term of the contrac t 
there has been and may continue to be significant volatility in the market prices for electricity and natural gas at the wholesale level  which will affect the company s operating results 
similarly  volatility in interest rates will affect the company s operating results 
the effects may be either positive or negative  depending on whether the company s subsidiaries are net buyers or sellers of electricity and natural gas 
the increase in unregulated generation operations revenues for and also reflects increased transactions by allegheny energy supply in the unregulated marketplace to sell electricity to wholesale customers and is due to having increased generation available for sale 
as a result of the electricity generation customer choice and competition act customer choice act in pennsylvania  two thirds of west penn s generation was released in the first quarter of and was available for sale into the unregulated marketplace by allegheny energy supply  subject to its obligations under the full requirements contracts it entered into with west penn 
in the first quarter of  the final one third of west penn s generation was similarly released and became available for sale into the deregulated marketplace 
in addition  the company transferred approximately  mw of potomac edison s generating assets to allegheny energy supply in august and transferred an additional mw of monongahela power s ohio and ferc jurisdictional generating assets and five mw of potomac edison s virginia hydroelectric generating assets to unregulated generation operations in on may   allegheny energy supply also completed the acquisition of three natural gas fired generating facilities with a total generating capacity of  mw in the midwest 
as a result  the unregulated generation operations segment had more generation available for sale into the deregulated marketplace in and  including sales to west penn  potomac edison  and monongahela power to meet their provider of last resort obligations

energy trading business acquisition the purchase agreement for merrill lynch s energy trading business provides that the company shall use its best efforts to contribute to allegheny energy supply the generating capacity from monongahela power s west virginia jurisdictional generating assets by september  if  after using its best efforts to comply with this provision of the purchase agreement  the company is prohibited by law from contributing to allegheny energy supply substantially all of the economic benefits associated with such assets  then merrill lynch shall have the right to require the company to repurchase all  but not less than all  of merrill lynch s equity interest in allegheny energy supply for million plus interest calculated from march  the purchase agreement also provides that  if the company has not completed an ipo involving allegheny energy supply within two years of march   merrill lynch has the right to sell its equity interest in allegheny energy supply to the company for million plus interest from march  significant continuing issues electric energy competition the electricity supply segment of the energy industry in the united states is becoming increasingly competitive 
the national energy policy act of led to market based regulation of the wholesale exchange of power within the electric industry by permitting the ferc to compel electric utilities to allow third parties to sell electricity to wholesale customers over their transmission systems 
the company continues to be an advocate of federal legislation to remove artificial barriers to competition in electricity markets  avoid regional dislocations  and ensure a level playing field 
in addition to the wholesale electricity market becoming more competitive  certain states have taken active steps toward allowing retail customers the right to choose their electricity supplier 
the company is at the forefront of state implemented retail competition  having negotiated settlement agreements in all of the states that monongahela power  potomac edison  and west penn serve 
pennsylvania  maryland  virginia  and ohio have retail choice programs in place 
west virginia s legislature has approved a deregulation plan  pending additional legislation regarding tax revenues for state and local governments and allowing implementation 
no final legislative action was taken in regarding implementation of the deregulation plan 
although the west virginia legislature may reconsider the deregulation plan in the january to march session  the current climate regarding restructuring makes it unlikely that the existing plan will be advanced in the regulatory environment applicable to the company s generation and t d businesses will continue to undergo substantial changes on both the federal and state level 
these changes have significantly affected the nature of the electric industry and the manner in which its participants conduct their business 
moreover  existing statutes and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted  new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to the company or its facilities  and future changes in laws and regulations may have an effect on the company in ways that cannot be predicted 
some markets  like california  have experienced interruptions of supply and price volatility  which have been the subject of a significant amount of press coverage  much of which has been critical of the restructuring initiatives 
in some markets  including california  government agencies and other interested parties have made proposals to re regulate areas of these markets that have been deregulated  and  in california  legislation has been passed placing a moratorium on the sale of generating facilities by regulated utilities 
proposals to re regulate the wholesale power market have been made at the federal level 
proposals of this sort  and legislative or other attention to the electric power restructuring process in the states in which the company currently operates  or may in the future operate  may cause deregulation to be delayed  discontinued  or reversed  which could have a material effect on the company s operations and strategies 
the recent bankruptcy filing by enron may affect the regulatory and legislative process 
in response to the enron bankruptcy filing and the september terrorists attacks  financial markets have been disrupted in general  and the availability and cost of capital for the company s business and that of its competitors has been adversely affected 
following the enron bankruptcy filing  credit ratings agencies reviewed the capital structure and earnings power of m allegheny energy  inc 
energy companies  including the company 
these events have constrained the capital available to the industry and could adversely affect the company s access to funding for its operations 
activities at the federal level the terrorists attacks of september have altered the agenda of the th congress 
in fact  some legislative initiatives have been delayed or postponed since that date because the congress and the bush administration have been focused on responding to these attacks 
however  part of that response may well be the consideration of energy security legislation currently in development 
the company is lobbying for the inclusion of important electricity restructuring provisions in this legislation  including the repeal or significant revision of puhca  as well as for critical infrastructure protection legislation 
prior to the attacks  two primary bills had been introduced in the us senate s 
 by former energy and natural resources committee chairman senator frank murkowski of alaska  and s 
 by the committee s new chairman  senator jeff bingaman of new mexico 
provisions from these bills could be included in the new energy legislation 
the primary hou se committee of jurisdiction  energy and commerce  initially passed the president s national energy security proposal and is only now considering accompanying electricity restructuring legislation 
among issues that are being addressed in this legislation are the repeal or significant revision of puhca and section mandatory purchase provisions of purpa 
the company continues to advocate the repeal of puhca and section of purpa on the grounds that they are obsolete and anticompetitive and that purpa results in utility customers paying above market prices for power 
separately  the senate banking committee in april approved s 
 legislation to repeal puhca 
maryland activities on june   the maryland psc approved the transfer of the generating assets of potomac edison to allegheny energy supply 
the transfer was completed in august maryland customers of potomac edison have had the right to choose an alternate electric supplier since july  while few customers have switched suppliers in potomac edison s service territory  some retail competition is occurring in other portions of the state 
on july   the maryland psc issued a restrictive order imposing standards of conduct for transactions between maryland utilities and their affiliates 
among other things  the order restricts sharing of employees between utilities and unregulated affiliates  announces the maryland psc s intent to impose a royalty fee to compensate the utility for the use by an affiliate of the utility s name and or logo and for other intangible or unqualified benefits  and requires asymmetric pricing for asset transfers between utilities and their affiliates 
asymmetric pricing requires that transfers of assets from the regulated utility to an affiliate be recorded at the greater of book cost or market value  while transfers of assets from the affiliate to the regulated utility be recorded at the lesser of book cost or market value 
potomac edison  along with substantially all of maryland s natural gas and electric utilities  filed a circuit court petition for judicial review and a motion for a stay of the order 
on april   the circuit court issued its decision affirming much of the maryland psc s order  but remanding portions of the order to the maryland psc  including the requirement for asymmetric pricing for asset transfers between utilities and their affiliates 
potomac edison and other maryland natural gas and electric utilities have noted an appeal of the circuit court s decision to maryland s court of special appeals 
the court of appeals  maryland s highest court  assumed jurisdiction over the appeal 
after the filing of briefs  the court of appeals heard oral arguments on january  the maryland psc also has initiated a proceeding  case no 
 to investigate certain affiliated activities of potomac edison and has also docketed similar proceedings for maryland s other natural gas and electric companies 
case no 
is pending before a maryland psc hearing examiner 
the maryland psc has initiated a proceeding  case no 
 to investigate potomac edison s proposed revisions to its line extension charges and policies for non residential customers 
the maryland psc delegated the proceeding to the hearing examiner division 
the hearing examiner held a prehearing conference on january   and established a procedural schedule 
the parties are entering into settlement discussions 
by letter order dated december   the maryland psc directed parties to commence meetings on january   on the status of the provision of default service 
potomac edison is participating in those meetings

ohio activities the ohio general assembly passed legislation in to restructure its electric utility industry 
as of january   all of the state s electricity consumers were able to choose their electricity supplier  beginning a five year transition to market rates 
residential customers are guaranteed a five percent reduction in the generation portion of their rate 
monongahela power reached a stipulated agreement with major parties on a transition plan to bring electric choice to its  ohio customers 
none of monongahela power s ohio customers has switched to another supplier 
the restructuring plan allowed the company to transfer its ohio and ferc jurisdictional generating assets to allegheny energy supply at book value 
that transfer was made on june  pennsylvania activities as of january   all electricity customers in pennsylvania have the right to choose their electric generation supplier 
the number of customers who have switched to another supplier and the amount of electrical load transferred in pennsylvania exceed that of any other state 
however  west penn had retained more than percent of its pennsylvania customers as of december  as part of west penn s restructuring settlement in pennsylvania  west penn retains the obligation to serve all customers who choose not to select an alternate supplier provider of last resort at rates that are capped at levels 
the generation rates are capped through virginia activities the virginia electric utility restructuring act restructuring act became law on march  all state utilities were required to submit a restructuring plan by january   to be effective on january  on december   the virginia scc approved potomac edison s phase ii of the functional separation plan 
in august  potomac edison transferred its virginia jurisdictional generating assets  excluding the hydroelectric assets located within virginia  to allegheny energy supply at book value 
customer choice was implemented for all customers in potomac edison s service territory beginning on january  the restructuring act was amended during the general assembly legislative session to direct the virginia scc to prepare for legislative approval a plan for competitive metering and billing and to authorize the virginia scc to implement a consumer education program on electric choice  funded through its regulatory tax 
on december   the virginia scc issued a report on competitive metering and billing 
its recommendations include allowing licensed electricity suppliers to provide billing services  with the customer selecting its preferred billing option 
the virginia scc also recommended that legislative action on competitive metering be deferred  pending further study  due to the complexities of the issue and limited competitive metering activities nationally 
on may   the virginia scc initiated proceedings to establish rules and regulations for consolidated billing services  competitive metering  and customer minimum stay periods 
various rulemaking proceedings to implement customer choice are ongoing before the virginia scc  including an application by potomac edison to participate in a regional transmission entity pjm west 
west virginia activities electric restructuring in west virginia remains unresolved and awaits further legislative action 
in january  the west virginia psc submitted a restructuring plan to the legislature for approval that would open full retail competition on january  on march   the west virginia legislature approved the west virginia psc s plan  but assigned the tax issues surrounding the plan to a legislative subcommittee for further study 
the start date of competition is contingent upon the necessary tax changes being made and implementation being approved by the legislature 
no final legislative action was taken in regarding implementation of the deregulation plan 
although the west virginia legislature may reconsider the deregulation plan in the january to march session  the current climate regarding restructuring makes it unlikely that the existing plan will be advanced in as approved by the west virginia psc  potomac edison transferred its generating assets to allegheny energy supply in august in accordance with the same restructuring agreement  potomac edison and monongahela power implemented a commercial and industrial rate reduction program on july  environmental issues the environmental protection agency s epa nitrogen oxides nox state implementation plan sip call regulation has been under litigation  and  on march   the united states court of appeals issued a decision that upheld the regulation 
however  state and industry litigants filed an appeal of that decision in april on june   the court denied the request for the appeal 
although the court did issue an order to delay the compliance date from may   until may   both the maryland and pennsylvania state rules to implement the epa nox sip call regulation still require compliance by may  west virginia has issued a proposed rule that would require compliance by may  however  the epa section petition regulation also m allegheny energy  inc 
requires the same level of nox reductions as the epa nox sip call regulation with a may   compliance date 
the epa section petition rule is also under litigation in the united states court of appeals 
a court decision in may upheld the rule 
in august  the court issued an order that suspends the section petition rule may   compliance date pending epa review of growth factors used to calculate the state nox budgets 
the company s compliance with such stringent regulations will require the installation of expensive post combustion control technologies on most of its power stations 
the company s construction forecast includes the expenditure of million of capital costs during the through period to comply with these regulations 
on august   the company received a letter from the epa requiring it to provide certain information on the following electric generating stations albright  armstrong  fort martin  harrison  hatfield s ferry  mitchell  pleasants  rivesville  r 
paul smith  and willow island 
allegheny energy supply and monongahela power now own these electric generating stations 
the letter requested information under section of the federal clean air act to determine compliance with the act and state implementation plan requirements  including potential application of the federal new source review nsr 
in general  these standards can require the installation of additional air pollution control equipment upon the major modification of an existing facility 
the company submitted these records in january the eventual outcome of the epa investigation is unknown 
similar inquiries have been made of other electric utilities and have resulted in enforcement proceedings being brought in many cases 
the company believes its generating facilities have been operating in accordance with the clean air act and the rules implementing the act 
the experience of other utilities  however  suggests that  in recent years  the epa may well have revised its interpretation of the rules regarding the determination of whether an action at a facility constitutes routine maintenance  which would not trigger the requirements of nsr  or a major modification of the facility  which would require compliance with nsr 
if federal nsr were to be applied to these generating stations  in addition to the possible imposition of fines  compliance would entail significant expenditures 
in connection with the deregulation of generation  the company has agreed to rate caps in each of its jurisdictions  and there are no provisions under those arrangements to increase rates to cover such expendit ures 
in december  the epa issued a decision to regulate coal and oil fired electric utility mercury emissions under title iii  section of the clean air act amendments caaa 
the epa plans to issue a proposed regulation by december and a final regulation by december the timing and level of required mercury emission reductions are unknown at this time 
other litigation in the normal course of business  the company and its subsidiaries become involved in various legal proceedings 
the company and its subsidiaries do not believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will have a material effect on their financial position

an amendment of fasb statement no 
 and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
effective january   the company implemented the requirements of these accounting standards 
these standards establish accounting and reporting requirements for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
they require that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the standards require that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in earnings or other comprehensive income and requires that a company formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
is expected to increase the volatility in reported earnings and other comprehensive income 
on january   allegheny energy supply recorded an asset of million on its consolidated balance sheet based on the fair value of its two cash flow hedge contracts 
an offsetting amount was recorded in other comprehensive income as a change in accounting principle as provided by sfas no 
allegheny energy supply had two principal risk management objectives regarding these cash flow hedge contracts 
first  allegheny energy supply has a contractual obligation to serve the instantaneous demands of its customers 
when this instantaneous demand exceeds allegheny energy supply s electric generating capacity  it must enter into contracts providing for the purchase of electricity to meet this shortage 
second  the price of electricity is subject to volatility 
this volatility is the result of many market factors  including the weather  and tends to be the highest during the summer months 
to ensure that energy market movements do not cause a significant degradation in earnings  allegheny energy suppl y enters into fixed price electricity purchase contracts 
m allegheny energy  inc 
the amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income related to these contracts were reclassified to earnings during july and august of  when the hedged transactions were executed 
as a result  a loss of million  before tax million  net of tax  was reclassified to power purchases and exchanges  net  from other comprehensive income during the third quarter of allegheny energy supply also had certain option contracts that met the derivative criteria in sfas no 
 which did not qualify for hedge accounting 
on january   allegheny energy supply recorded an asset of 
million and a liability of million on its consolidated balance sheet based on the fair value of these contracts 
in accordance with sfas no 
 allegheny energy supply recorded a charge of million against earnings  net of the related tax effect million  before tax  for these contracts as a change in accounting principle on january  as of december   these contracts had expired  thus reducing their fair value to zero 
the total change in fair value of million for these contracts during was recorded as a gain in unregulated generation revenues on the consolidated statement of operations 
on november   allegheny ventures completed the acquisition of fellon mccord and alliance energy services 
alliance energy services is engaged in the purchase  sale  and marketing of natural gas and other energy related services to various commercial and industrial customers across the united states 
alliance energy services  on behalf of its customers  uses both physical and financial derivative contracts  including forwards  nymex futures  options  and swaps  in order to manage price risk associated with its purchase and sales activities 
alliance energy services primary strategy is to minimize its market risk exposure with respect to its forecasted physical natural gas sales contracts to its customers by entering into offsetting financial and physical natural gas purchase and transportation contracts 
the transactions executed under this strategy are accounted for as cash flow hedges  with the fair value of the offsetting contracts recorded as assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and changes in fair value for these contracts recorded to other comprehensive income 
as of december   an unrealized loss of million  net of reclassifications to earnings and tax  was recorded to other comprehensive income for these contracts 
these hedges were highly effective during based on the contracts fair values at december   and the settlement dates of these contracts  the company expects to reclassify a loss of approximately million  before taxes  of the amount accumulated in other comprehensive inc ome to earnings in  when the related contracts are settled 
as of december   the company s cash flow hedge contracts were hedging forecasted transactions through december and had a net fair value of million 
additionally  as a service to its customers  alliance energy services offers price risk intermediation services in order to mitigate the market risk associated with natural gas 
under this program  alliance energy services will execute positions with the customer and enter into offsetting positions with a third counterparty 
these transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
and are accounted for on a mark to market basis 
at december   the fair value of these contracts as an asset were million and the fair value of the contracts as liabilities were million 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates 
the commodity price risk exposure results from market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity  natural gas  and other energy related commodities 
the interest rate risk exposure results from changes in interest rates related to interest rate swaps  commercial paper  and variable and fixed rate debt 
the company is mandated by its board of directors to engage in a program that systematically identifies  measures  evaluates  and actively manages and reports on market driven risks 
the company has a corporate energy risk policy adopted by its board of directors and monitored by a risk management committee chaired by its chief executive officer and composed of senior management 
an independent risk management group within the company actively measures and monitors the risk exposures to ensure compliance with the policy and it is periodically reviewed 
to manage the company s financial exposure to commodity price fluctuations in its energy trading  fuel procurement  power marketing  natural gas supply  and risk management activities  the company routinely enters into contracts  such as electricity and natural gas purchase and sale commitments  to hedge its risk exposure 
however  the company does not hedge the entire exposure of its operations from commodity price volatility for a variety of m allegheny energy  inc 
reasons 
to the extent the company does not successfully hedge against commodity price volatility  its results of operations and financial position may be affected either favorably or unfavorably by a shift in the future price curves 
also  the company s energy trading business enters into certain contracts for the sale of electricity produced by its midwest generating assets and its other generating facilities in excess of the power provided to its regulated utility subsidiaries to meet their provider of last resort obligations 
these contracts are recorded at their fair value and are an economic hedge for the generating facilities 
for accounting purposes  the generating facilities are recorded at historical cost less depreciation 
as a result  the company s results of operations and financial position can be favorably or unfavorably affected by a change in future market prices used to value the contracts  since there is not an offsetting adjustment to the recorded cost of the generating facilities 
of its commodity driven risks  the company is primarily exposed to risks associated with the wholesale marketing of electricity  including the generation  fuel procurement  power marketing  and trading of electricity 
the company s wholesale activities principally consist of marketing and trading over the counter forward contracts  swaps  and nymex futures contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity and natural gas 
the majority of these contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell electricity and natural gas at fixed prices in the future 
the company s forward contracts generally require physical delivery of electricity and natural gas 
the swap and nymex futures contracts generally require financial settlement 
the company also uses option contracts to buy and sell electricity and natural gas at fixed prices in the future 
these option contracts are generally entered into for energy trading and risk management purposes 
the risk management activities focus on management of volume risks supply  operational risks facility outages  and market risks energy prices 
a significant portion of the company s energy trading activities involves long term structured transactions 
during  the company entered into several long term contracts as part of its energy trading activities that may affect its market risk exposure 
uncertainty regarding market conditions and commodity prices increases further into the future 
the following contracts that extend beyond five years were added to the company s energy trading portfolio during in march  allegheny energy supply acquired an energy trading business  including the contractual right to call up to  mw of generation in california through may  in march  allegheny energy supply signed a power sales agreement with the cdwr  the electricity buyer for the state of california 
the contract is for a period through december under the terms of the agreement  the company has committed to supply california with contract volumes  varying from mw to mw  through december for the last seven years of the contract  the contract volume will be fixed at  mw 
the company s source for this electricity will be partly through its contractual right to call up to  mw of generation capacity in california  which the company acquired as part of the acquisition of an energy trading business  in may  allegheny energy supply signed a year agreement with las vegas cogeneration ii  llc  for mw of generating capacity  beginning in the third quarter of  and the company has long term agreements with el paso natural gas company for the transportation of natural gas that started on june   under tariffs approved by the ferc 
these agreements  in part  provide for firm transportation of  thousand cubic feet mcf of natural gas per day through september   from western texas and northern new mexico to the southern california border 
the remainder of the agreements provide for firm transportation of  mcf per day through september   from western texas to the southern california border 
the company s acquisition of alliance energy services  on november   also increased its exposure to market risks associated with the purchase  sale  and transportation of natural gas 
as previously discussed see derivative instruments and hedging activities starting on page m  alliance energy services is engaged in the sale and transportation of natural gas to various commercial and industrial customers across the united states 
it  on behalf of its customers  uses forwards  nymex futures  options  and swaps in order to manage price risk associated with its purchase and sales activities

credit risk credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty to a transaction will be unable to fulfill its contractual obligations 
the credit standing of counterparties is established through the evaluation of the prospective counterparty s financial condition  specified collateral requirements where deemed necessary  and the use of standardized agreements  which facilitate netting of cash flows  associated with a single counterparty 
financial conditions of existing counterparties are monitored on an ongoing basis 
the company s independent risk management group oversees credit risk 
as of december   the company has received million of cash collateral from counterparties involved in the company s energy trading activities 
the company is engaged in various trading activities in which counterparties primarily include electric and natural gas utilities  independent power producers  oil and natural gas exploration and production companies  energy marketers  and commercial and industrial customers 
in the event the counterparties do not fulfill their obligations  the company may be exposed to credit risk 
the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty or issuer of the instrument 
the company has a concentration of customers in the electric and natural gas utility and oil and natural gas exploration and production industries 
these concentrations in customers may affect the company s overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that the customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions 
the following table provides the net fair value of commodity contract asset positions by counterparty credit quality for the company at december  credit quality amount millions of dollars investment grade non investment grade no external ratings government agencies other total where a parent company provided a guarantee for a counterparty  the company used the parent company s credit rating 
the net fair value of billion  or percent of the company s total assets  for no external ratings government agencies mainly relates to allegheny energy supply s power sales agreement with the cdwr  the department within the state government of california that is responsible for buying electricity for that state 
as of december   the cdwr did not receive a credit rating from an external  independent credit rating agency 
on february   the california puc approved a rate agreement with the cdwr in order for the cdwr to issue bonds to repay the state of california s general fund and other outstanding loans 
the agreement would create two streams of revenue for the cdwr by establishing bond charges and power charges on electricity customers 
revenues from power charges will be used to pay the cdwr s operating expenses  including payment of its long term power purchase agreements 
certain  as yet unspecified  operating expenses of the cdwr will be payab le from the bond charge 
the rate agreement would require the cdwr to use its best efforts to renegotiate its long term power agreements and does not limit the ability of the california puc or the cdwr to engage in litigation regarding those contracts 
if the company s agreement were renegotiated or if the cdwr failed for any reason to meet its obligations under this agreement  the value of the agreement as an asset might need to be reduced on the company s consolidated balance sheet  with a corresponding reduction in net income 
as of december   the cdwr has met all of its obligations under this agreement 
on february   the california puc filed a complaint with the ferc seeking to abrogate various contracts to which the cdwr is a counterparty  including two contracts with the company to sell power to the cdwr 
the california puc alleges that the contracts are unjust and unreasonable due to market dysfunction and the exercise of market power by electricity suppliers during in california 
as a result  the california puc argues that the cdwr was forced to pay prices that are too high and accept onerous terms and conditions 
in the alternative  the california puc requests that the ferc reform the challenged contracts to provide just and reasonable pricing  reduce the duration of the contracts  and eliminate certain non price items 
the company believes that its contracts with the cdwr are valid and binding upon the cdwr 
the company is evaluating the complaint filed by the california puc and will respond to the complaint in the proceeding before the ferc 
at this time  the company cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding 
on december   various enron entities  including  but not limited to  enron north america corporation and enron power marketing  inc  collectively enron  filed voluntary petitions for chapter reorganization with the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york 
m allegheny energy  inc 
allegheny energy supply and enron have master trading agreements in place  which include an international swaps and dealers association isda agreement  a master power purchase and sale agreement  and a master gas purchase and sale agreement agreements 
within all of these agreements  there is netting and set off language 
this language allows allegheny energy supply and enron to net and set off all amounts owed to each other under the agreements 
pursuant to the agreements  the voluntary petition for chapter reorganization by enron constituted an event of default 
allegheny energy supply effected an early termination as of november   with respect to each of the agreements  as permitted under the terms of the agreements 
allegheny energy supply believes it has appropriately exercised its contractual rights to terminate the agreements and to net out transactions arising within each agreement 
pursuant to the bankruptcy code  allegheny energy supply believes it should be able to offset any termination values or payment amounts owed it against amounts it owes to enron as a result of the netting 
as of november   the fair value of all the company s trades with enron that were terminated was a net asset of approximately million and the company had a net payable to enron of approximately million 
after applying the netting provisions of each agreement  including any collateral posted by enron with allegheny energy supply  approximately million was expensed as uncollectible in allegheny energy supply continues to evaluate its enron transactions on a daily basis 
market risk market risk arises from the potential for changes in the value of energy related to price and volatility in the market 
the company reduces these risks by using its generating assets and contractual generation under its control to back positions on physical transactions 
aggregate and counterparty market risk exposure and credit risk limits are monitored within the guidelines of the corporate energy risk policy 
the company evaluates commodity price risk  operational risk  and credit risk in establishing the fair value of commodity contracts 
the company uses various methods to measure its exposure to market risk  including a value at risk model var 
var is a statistical model that attempts to predict risk of loss based on historical market price and volatility data over a given period of time 
the quantification of market risk using var provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products with different risk factors to set the overall corporate risks tolerance  determine risk targets  and positions 
the company calculates var using a variance covariance technique that models option positions  using a linear approximation of their value based upon the options delta equivalents 
due to inherent limitations of var  including the use of approximations to value options  subjectivity in the choice of liquidation period  and reliance on historical data to calibrate the model  the var calculation may not accurately reflect the company s market risk exposure 
as a result  the actual changes in the company s market risk s ensitive instruments could differ from the calculated var  and such changes could have a material effect on its financial results 
in addition to var  the company routinely performs stress and scenario analyses to measure extreme losses due to exceptional events 
the var and stress test results are reviewed to determine the maximum allowable reduction in the fair value of the energy trading portfolios 
the company s var calculation includes all contracts  whether financially or physically settled  associated with its wholesale marketing and trading of electricity  natural gas  and other commodities 
the company calculates the var  including its generating capacity and the power sales agreements for the regulated utility subsidiaries provider of last resort retail load obligations 
the var calculation does not include positions beyond three years because there is a limited  observable  liquid market 
the var calculation also does not include commodity price exposure related to the procurement of fuel for its generation 
the company believes that this represents the most complete calculation of its value at risk 
the var amount represents the potential loss in fair value from the market risk sensitive positions described above over a one day holding period with a percent confidence level 
as of december   the company s var was million  including its generating capacity and power sales agreements with its regulated utility subsidiaries 
for  the company s average var using the same calculation was million 
the company also calculated var using the full term of all trading positions  but excluded its generating capacity and the provider of last resort retail load obligations of its regulated utility subsidiaries 
this calculation includes positions beyond three years for which there is a limited  observable  liquid market 
as a result  this calculation is based upon management s best estimates and modeling assumptions  which could materially differ from actual results 
as of december   this calculation yielded a var of million 
at december   the company s var was million 
this calculation included contracts and positions for the next months and the company s generating assets  its provider of last resort retail load obligations of its regulated utility subsidiaries  retail  and other similar obligations 
this calculation method was used prior to the m allegheny energy  inc 
purchase of the energy trading business 
as of december   the comparable var was million 
the decrease in var for was primarily due to a reduction in the volatility of energy prices in the company has entered into long term arrangements with original terms of months or longer to purchase approximately percent of its base coal requirements for its owned generation in the company depends on short term arrangements and spot purchases for its remaining requirements

ohio deregulation on june   the company transferred  at book value  the ohio portion  approximately megawatts mw  of its generating assets to allegheny energy supply  llc allegheny energy supply  the nonutility generating subsidiary of allegheny energy 
the transfer was approved by the ohio puc as part of a settlement that implemented a restructuring plan for the company 
this restructuring plan allowed the company s ohio customers to choose their generation supplier effective january  additionally  the plan provides for the following residential customers received a five percent reduction in the generation portion of their electric bills during a five year market development period that continues through december   for commercial and industrial customers  existing generation rates were frozen at the january   rates for the market development period the market development period continues through december   for large commercial and industrial customers and through dec ember   for small commercial customers  the company will collect from shopping customers a regulatory transition charge of per kilowatt hour kwh for the market development period  and allegheny energy supply is permitted to offer competitive generation service throughout ohio 
west virginia deregulation in march  the west virginia legislature passed house resolution approving an electric deregulation plan submitted by the public service commission of west virginia west virginia psc with certain modifications 
under the resolution  the implementation of the west virginia deregulation plan cannot occur until the legislature enacts certain tax changes regarding the preservation of tax revenues for state and local governments and other changes conforming to the plan and authorizing implementation 
the plan provides for all customers to have choice of a generation supplier and allows the company to transfer  at book value  the west virginia portion approximately  mw of owned capacity and mw of capacity in generating units at which the company does not exercise control over percent of the facility of its generating assets to allegheny energy supply 
no final legislative action was taken in regarding implementation of the deregulation plan 
although the west virginia legisla ture may reconsider the deregulation plan in the january to march session  the current climate regarding restructuring makes it unlikely that the existing plan will be advanced in on june   the west virginia psc issued an order regarding the transfer of the generating assets of the company 
the june   order permits the company to submit a petition to the west virginia psc seeking approval to transfer its west virginia generating assets prior to the implementation of the deregulation plan 
a filing before implementation of the deregulation plan is required to include commitments to the consumer and other protections contained in the deregulation plan 
on august   with a supplemental filing on october   the company filed a petition seeking west virginia psc approval to transfer its west virginia jurisdictional generating assets to allegheny energy supply 
settlement discussions regarding the generating asset transfer are ongoing 
in addition to the company s deregulation efforts  the company has been expanding its customer base through the acquisitions of mountaineer gas in august and west virginia power company west virginia power in december m monongahela power company and subsidiaries other significant events in   and initial public offering of allegheny energy supply on july   allegheny energy filed a u application with the securities and exchange commission sec  seeking authorization under the public utility holding company act of puhca to effect an initial public offering ipo of up to percent of the common stock in a new holding company  which would own percent of allegheny energy supply  and then distribute the remaining common stock owned by allegheny energy to its shareholders on a tax free basis

acquisitions on august   the company completed the purchase of mountaineer gas  a regulated natural gas sales  transportation  and distribution company serving a large portion of west virginia  from energy corporation of america eca for million  which included the assumption of million of existing long term debt 
the acquisition included the assets of mountaineer gas services  inc mountaineer gas services  which operates natural gas producing properties  natural gas gathering facilities  and intrastate transmission pipelines 
the acquisition increased the company s number of natural gas customers in west virginia by approximately  see note e to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in december  the company purchased from utilicorp united  inc the assets of west virginia power  an electric and natural gas distribution company located in southern west virginia  for approximately million 
the west virginia power acquisition added approximately  electric distribution customers and  natural gas customers

allegheny power s markets for regulated electric and gas retail sales are in maryland  ohio  pennsylvania  virginia  and west virginia 
on june   the west virginia psc approved a joint stipulation and agreement for settlement  stating agreed upon rates designed to make the rates of potomac edison and the company consistent 
under the terms of the settlement  several tariff schedules  notably those available to residential and small commercial customers  will require several incremental steps to reach the agreed upon rate level 
the settlement rates resulted in a revenue reduction of approximately 
million for  increasing over eight years to an annual reduction of approximately million 
offsetting the decrease in rates  the settlement approved by the west virginia psc directs the company to amortize the existing over collected deferred fuel balance as of june  approximately million  as a reduction of expenses over a four and one half year period beginning july  also  effective july   the company ceased its expanded net energy cost fuel clause as part of the settlement 
on october   the west virginia psc approved an interim increase of the commodity rate for natural gas customers of the company  formerly west virginia power customers  for natural gas service bills rendered on and after december  on december   the west virginia psc approved additional increases for bills rendered on and after january   through november  total revenue increase for the twelve month period of million or percent for the commodity rate 
the commodity rate  or the purchased gas adjustment pga rate  is the portion of the bill that reflects the cost of gas  which increased significantly during the west virginia psc approved a tiered m monongahela power company and subsidiaries rate structure  with rates established for the winter heating season  effective january   through april   and further increased rates effective may   through november   dependent upon the level of cost recovery after the winter heating season 
this approach allowed the company full recovery of these costs  but eased the increase on the average customer 
on october   the west virginia psc approved an interim decrease in the pga rate effective with bills rendered on and after december  through november  total revenue decrease for the twelve month period of million or percent for the commodity rate 
this approval became final on december  the reduced pga rate is the result of changes in the market price that the company pays for natural gas 
with this adjustment  customers will benefit from recent decreases in natural gas market prices 
these increases and decreases in gas cost recovery revenues have no effect on earnings because they we re implemented via the pga mechanism 
under the pga procedure  differences between revenues received for energy costs and actual energy costs are deferred until the next rate proceeding  when energy rates are adjusted to return or recover previous over recoveries or under recoveries  respectively 
on january   mountaineer gas filed for a rate increase with the west virginia psc in response to significant increases in the market price for natural gas 
on july   a settlement was reached and a joint stipulation and agreement for settlement was filed with the west virginia psc 
in october  the west virginia psc approved the settlement agreement  which provides for a base revenue increase of million per year and an increase in natural gas cost recovery revenues of approximately million per year a total increase of approximately percent over existing rates effective november  also  mountaineer gas returned to the standard pga treatment of purchased natural gas costs at the conclusion of the rate moratorium on october  regional transmission organization rto on march   allegheny energy and the pennsylvania new jersey maryland interconnection  llc pjm filed documents with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to expand the pjm transmission system and energy market through the creation of pjm west 
the filing represents collaboration among allegheny energy  pjm  and numerous stakeholders 
allegheny energy and pjm have asked the ferc to confirm that pjm west satisfies the ferc s requirements for a rto as set forth in order no 
under the pjm west proposal  allegheny energy s regulated utility subsidiaries will transfer operational control over their transmission system to pjm 
allegheny energy will adopt pjm s transmission pricing methodology  including pjm s congestion management system 
in addition  pjm will expand its day ahead and real time energy markets to include pjm west 
as a result  energy suppliers will be able to reach consumers anywhere within the expanded pjm pjm west market at a single transmission rate  instead of pay ing multiple transmission rates as they do today 
allegheny energy s filing also requested authorization to recover anticipated lost transmission revenues of approximately million annually and pjm west start up expenses billed to allegheny energy by pjm of approximately million annually through by order dated july   the ferc conditionally approved pjm west  subject to a compliance filing clarifying certain terms and conditions of pjm west and providing additional support for allegheny energy s claims for lost transmission revenues and start up expenses 
pjm and allegheny energy submitted their compliance filing on september  on january   the ferc authorized allegheny energy and pjm to proceed with pjm west effective march  the ferc s order set for hearing the question whether allegheny energy had adequately supported its claim to recover anticipated lost transmission revenues and start up expenses  and created uncertainty as to whether the ferc intended to initiate a general investigation into allegheny energy s transmission rates  which could potentially lead to an overall reduction to its transmission revenues 
allegheny energy requested clarification  and on march   the ferc issued a further order explaining m monongahela power company and subsidiaries that its january  order did not initiate a general investigation of allegheny energy s transmission revenues 
accordingly  in light of the limited scope of the hearing ordered by the ferc  allegheny energy has elected to proceed with pjm west effective april  allegheny energy anticipates the formation of pjm west will enhance its ability to compete for power sales in the expanded pjm pjm west market area

through june   for west virginia and december   for ohio  changes in fuel revenues had no effect on the company s net income because increases and decreases in fuel and purchased power costs and sales of transmission services and bulk power were passed on to customers by adjustment of customers bills through a fuel clause 
wholesale and other revenues  including affiliates were as follows millions of dollars wholesale customers affiliated companies street lighting and other total wholesale and other revenues wholesale customers are cooperatives and municipalities that own their distribution systems and buy all or part of their bulk power needs from the company under the ferc regulation 
competition in the wholesale market for electricity was initiated by the national energy policy act of  which permits wholesale generators  utility owned and otherwise  and wholesale customers to request from owners of bulk power transmission facilities a commitment to supply transmission services 
all of the company s wholesale customers have signed contracts to remain as customers until november  wholesale customer revenue for and remained relatively flat as compared to and  respectively 
revenues from affiliated companies represent sales of energy and intercompany allocations of generating capacity  generation spinning reserves  and transmission services pursuant to a power supply agreement among the company and the other regulated utility subsidiaries of allegheny energy 
revenues from affiliated companies decreased by million in due to the affiliates of the company securing their power requirements from allegheny energy supply 
revenues from affiliated companies increased by million in due to the company selling power to allegheny energy supply offset  in part  by a decrease in power sold to the company s affiliates 
the company has a dispatch arrangement with allegheny energy supply 
street lighting and other revenues increased by million and million for and  respectively  due to sales of natural gas as a result of the acquisition of mountaineer gas in and west virginia power in transmission services and bulk power sales include transactions of transmission services  bulk power  and other energy services to power marketers and other utilities 
revenues from transmission services and bulk power sales remained relatively flat for when compared to revenues from bulk power sales decreased by million in when m monongahela power company and subsidiaries compared to due to decreased sales to power marketers and other utilities 
this decrease was the result of increased affiliated sales due to a dispatch agreement with the company s unregulated affiliate  allegheny energy supply 
with this agreement  regulated operations sells the amount of its bulk power that exceeds its regulated load to allegheny energy supply and conversely buys generation from unregulated operations when regulated load at times exceeds regulated generation 
such a relationship allows the company s generation to be dispatched in a more efficient manner 
revenues from transmission and other energy services remained relatively flat in revenues from transmission and other energy services in increased primarily due to increased megawatt hours mwh transmitted 
through june   and december   for the company s west virginia and ohio jurisdictions  respectively  the costs of purchased power and revenues from sales to power marketers and other utilities  including transmission services  were recovered from or credited to customers under fuel and energy cost recovery procedures 
the impact to the fuel and energy cost recovery clauses may either be positive or negative depending on whether the company is a net buyer or seller of electricity during such periods and the open commitments  which exist at such times 
the impact of such price volatility was insignificant to the company in the first six months of for west virginia and twelve months ended for ohio because increases or decreases were passed on to customers through operation of fuel clauses 
effective july   and december   once the fuel clauses were eliminated in west virginia and ohio  respectively  the company assumed the risk and benefits of changes in fuel and purchased power costs and sales of transmission services and bulk power in its west virginia and ohio jurisdiction 
when a fuel clause is in effect  changes in fuel revenues have no effect on consolidated net income because increases and decreases in fuel and purchased power costs and sales of transmission services and bulk power are passed on to the customer through fuel clauses 
operating expenses fuel expense for decreased by million as compared to due to an percent decrease in kwhs generated  partially offset by a percent increase related to average fuel prices 
the decline in kwhs generated can be attributed  in part  to the company s transfer of the ohio portion of its generation assets to allegheny energy supply on june  fuel expenses increased by million for as compared to due primarily to a percent increase related to kwhs generated  offset in part by a 
percent decrease in average fuel prices 
m monongahela power company and subsidiaries purchased power and exchanges  net  represents power purchases from and exchanges with other companies and purchases from qualified facilities under the purpa  capacity charges paid to allegheny generating company agc  an affiliate partially owned by the company  and other transactions with affiliates made pursuant to a power supply agreement whereby each company uses the most economical generation available in the system at any given time  and consists of the following items millions of dollars nonaffiliated transactions purchased power from purpa generation other power exchanges  net affiliated transactions agc capacity charges other purchased power and exchanges  net purpa cost cents per kwh power purchased from purpa generators decreased in by million due to an unscheduled shutdown of a purpa generation facility and credits recorded by the company for overpayments of purpa generation in prior years 
the increase of million in power purchased from purpa generators in was the result of an increase in the amount of kwh purchased 
other purchased power from non affiliates in remained relatively flat while increasing by million in due to purchases required to serve customers acquired through the acquisition of west virginia power 
the agc capacity charges decreased by million in due to the transfer of the company s ohio portion of its generation assets on june   which included transferring a portion of the company s ownership in agc to allegheny energy supply 
other affiliated transactions increased in and by million and million  respectively  due to an increase in power purchased from allegheny energy supply 
in early  a dispatch agreement was implemented between the company and allegheny energy supply that allows the company s generation to be dispatched in a more efficient manner 
the company purchases generation from allegheny energy supply when the company s load exceeds its generation and sells excess generation to allegheny energy supply when the company s generation exceeds its load 
natural gas purchases and production reflect the acquisition of mountaineer gas in august and west virginia power in december the increase in other operation expenses in of million was attributable to additional expenses associated with serving customers acquired through the acquisition of mountaineer gas in august the increase in of million was due to additional expenses associated with serving the customers acquired through the acquisitions of west virginia power and mountaineer gas 
the increases of million and million in maintenance expenses in and  respectively  were due primarily to increased power station maintenance and the t d maintenance expenses associated with the mountaineer gas acquisition 
the acquisition of west virginia power also contributed to the increase in maintenance expenses in maintenance expenses represent costs incurred to maintain the power stations  the t d system  and general plant and reflect routine maintenance of equipment and rights of way  m monongahela power company and subsidiaries as well as planned repairs and unplanned expenditures  primarily from forced outages at the power stations and periodic storm damage on the t d system 
variations in maintenance expense result primarily from unplanned events and planned projects  which vary in timing and magnitude depending upon the length of time equipment has been in service and the amount of work found necessary when the equipment is dismantled 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million in as a result of the acquisition of mountaineer gas in august offset  in part  by the transfer of the company s ohio portion of its generation assets to allegheny energy supply in june depreciation and amortization expense increased by million in due to increased investment  primarily associated with the acquisitions of west virginia power and mountaineer gas 
taxes other than income taxes increased by million in due in part to increased west virginia business and occupation taxes and west virginia state property taxes due to the acquisition of mountaineer gas 
taxes other than income taxes increased by million in primarily due to increased west virginia business and occupation taxes and west virginia gross receipts taxes related to the acquisitions of west virginia power and mountaineer gas 
the increase in and is also attributable to increased payroll taxes as a result of an increase in the number of employees as a result of the mountaineer gas acquisition and an increase in the fica base pay for each respective year 
the decrease in federal and state income taxes in of million was attributable to a decrease in taxable income 
the increase in federal and state income tax expense in of million was primarily due to increased operating income and depreciation differences 
note f to the consolidated financial statements provides a further analysis of income tax expense 
other income and deductions the increase in other income  net  of million in was primarily due to an increase in interest income as a result of investments within the money pool in the year offset  in part  by a decrease in the company s share of the earnings from agc 
other income  net remained relatively flat for interest charges the increases in interest charges in and of million and million  respectively  were primarily from increased average long term debt outstanding as a result of additional debt incurred during the acquisition of mountaineer gas in august the increase in average long term debt in was also the result of the acquisition of west virginia power in december interest expense is also affected by changes in the levels of short term debt maintained by the company throughout the year  as well as the associated interest rates

significant continuing issues electric energy competition the electricity supply segment of the electric industry in the united states is becoming increasingly competitive 
the national energy policy act of deregulated the wholesale exchange of power within the electric industry by permitting the ferc to compel electric utilities to allow third parties to sell electricity to wholesale customers over their transmission systems 
the company and its parent  allegheny energy  continue to be an advocate of federal legislation to remove artificial barriers to competition in electricity markets  avoid regional dislocations  and ensure a level playing field 
in addition  with the wholesale electricity market becoming more competitive  certain states have taken active steps toward allowing retail customers the right to choose their electricity supplier 
allegheny energy is at the forefront of state implemented retail competition  having negotiated settlement agreements in all of the states that allegheny power serves 
maryland  pennsylvania  ohio  and virginia have retail choice programs in place 
west virginia s legislature has approved a deregulation plan for the company pending additional legislation regarding tax revenues for state and local governments 
no final legislative action was taken in regarding implementation of the deregulation plan 
although the west virginia legislature may reconsider the deregulation plan in the january to march session  the current climate regarding restructuring makes it unlikely that the existing plan will be advanced in the regulatory environment applicable to allegheny energy s generation and t d businesses will continue to undergo substantial changes on both the federal and state level 
these changes have significantly affected the nature of the electric industry and the manner in which its participants conduct their business 
moreover  existing statutes and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted  new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to allegheny energy or its facilities  and future changes in laws and regulations may have an effect on allegheny energy in ways that cannot be predicted 
some markets  like california  have experienced interruptions of supply and price volatility  which have been the subject of a significant amount of press coverage  much of which has been critical of the restructuring initiatives 
in some markets  including california  government agencies and other interested parties have made proposals to re regulate areas of these markets that have been deregulated  and  in california  legislation has been passed placing a moratorium on the sale of generating facilities by regulated utilities 
proposals to re regulate the wholesale power market have been made at the federal level 
proposals of this sort  and legislative or other attention to the electric power restructuring process in the states in which allegheny energy currently operates  or may m monongahela power company and subsidiaries in the future operate  may cause deregulation to be delayed  discontinued  or reversed  which could have a material effect on allegheny energy s operations and strategies 
the recent bankruptcy filing by enron corporation enron may affect the regulatory and legislative process 
in response to the enron bankruptcy filing and the september terrorists attacks  financial markets have been disrupted in general  and the availability and cost of capital for allegheny energy s business and that of its competitors has been adversely affected 
following the enron bankruptcy filing  credit ratings agencies reviewed the capital structure and earnings power of energy companies  including allegheny energy 
these events have constrained the capital available to the industry and could adversely affect allegheny energy s access to funding for its operations 
activities at the federal level the terrorists attacks of september   have altered the agenda of the th congress 
in fact  some legislative initiatives have been delayed or postponed since that date because the congress and the bush administration have been focused on responding to these attacks 
however  part of that response may well be the consideration of energy security legislation currently in development 
allegheny energy is lobbying for the inclusion of important electricity restructuring provisions in this legislation  including the repeal or significant revision of puhca  as well as for critical infrastructure protection legislation 
prior to the attack  two primary bills had been introduced in the us senate s 
 by former energy and natural resources committee chairman senator frank murkowski of alaska  and s 
 by the committee s new chairman  senator jeff bingaman of new mexico 
provisions from these bills could be included in the new energy legislation 
the primary house committee of jurisdict ion  energy and commerce  initially passed the president s national energy security proposal and is only now considering accompanying electricity restructuring legislation 
among issues that are being addressed in this legislation are the repeal or significant revision of puhca and section mandatory purchase provisions of purpa 
allegheny energy continues to advocate the repeal of puhca and section of purpa on the grounds that they are obsolete and anticompetitive and that purpa results in utility customers paying above market prices for power 
separately  the senate banking committee in april approved s 
 legislation to repeal puhca 
ohio activities the ohio general assembly passed legislation in to restructure its electric utility industry 
as of january   all of the state s electricity customers were able to choose their electricity supplier  beginning a five year transition to market rates 
residential customers are guaranteed a five percent cut in the generation portion of their rate 
the company reached a stipulated agreement with major parties on a transition plan to bring electric choice to its approximately  ohio customers 
none of the company s ohio customers have switched to another supplier 
the restructuring plan allowed the company to transfer its ohio and ferc jurisdictional generating assets to allegheny energy supply at book value on or after january  that transfer was made on june  west virginia activities electric restructuring in west virginia remains unresolved and awaits further legislative action 
in january  the west virginia psc submitted a restructuring plan to the legislature for approval that would open full retail competition on january  on march   the west virginia legislature approved the west virginia psc s plan  but assigned the tax issues surrounding the plan to a legislative subcommittee for further study 
the start date of competition is contingent upon the necessary tax changes being made and approved by the legislature 
no final legislative action was taken in regarding implementation of the deregulation plan 
although the west virginia legislature may reconsider in the january to march session  the current climate regarding restructuring makes it unlikely that the existing plan will be advanced in m monongahela power company and subsidiaries as approved by the west virginia psc  potomac edison transferred its generating assets to allegheny energy supply in august in accordance with the same restructuring agreement  potomac edison and the company implemented a commercial and industrial rate reduction program on july  the status of electric energy competition in virginia  maryland  and pennsylvania in which affiliates of the company serve are as follows virginia activities the virginia electric utility restructuring act restructuring act became law on march  all state utilities were required to submit a restructuring plan by january   to be effective on january  on december   the virginia state corporation commission virginia scc approved potomac edison s phase ii of the functional separation plan 
in august  potomac edison transferred its virginia jurisdictional generating assets  excluding the hydroelectric assets located within virginia  to allegheny energy supply at book value 
customer choice was implemented for all customers in potomac edison s service territory beginning on january  the restructuring act was amended during the general assembly legislative session to direct the virginia scc to prepare for legislative approval a plan for competitive metering and billing and to authorize the virginia scc to implement a consumer education program on electric choice  funded through its regulatory tax 
on december   the virginia scc issued a report on competitive metering and billing 
its recommendations include allowing licensed electricity suppliers to provide billing services  with the customer selecting its preferred billing option 
the virginia scc also recommended that legislative action on competitive metering be deferred pending further study  due to the complexities of the issue and limited competitive metering activities nationally 
on may   the virginia scc initiated proceedings to establish rules and regulations for consolidated billing services  competitive metering  and customer minimum stay periods 
various rulemaking proceedings to implement customer choice are ongoing before the virginia scc  including an application by potomac edison to participate in a regional transmission entity pjm west 
maryland activities on june   the maryland public service commission maryland psc approved the transfer of the generating assets of potomac edison to allegheny energy supply 
the transfer was completed in august maryland customers of potomac edison have had the right to choose an alternate electric supplier since july  while few customers have switched suppliers in potomac edison s service territory  some retail competition is occurring in other portions of the state 
on july   the maryland psc issued a restrictive order imposing standards of conduct for transactions between maryland utilities and their affiliates 
among other things  the order restricts sharing of employees between utilities and affiliates  announces the maryland psc s intent to impose a royalty fee to compensate the utility for the use by an affiliate of the utility s name and or logo and for other intangible or unqualified benefits  and requires asymmetric pricing for asset transfers between utilities and their affiliates 
asymmetric pricing requires that transfers of assets from the regulated utility to an affiliate be recorded at the greater of book cost or market value while transfers of assets from the affiliate to the regulated utility be recorded at the lesser of book cost or market value 
potomac edison  along with substantially all of maryland s natural gas and electric utilities  filed a circuit court petition for judicial review and a motion for stay of the order 
on april   the circuit court issued its decision affirming much of the maryland psc s order  but remanding portions of the order to the maryland psc  including the requirement for asymmetric pricing for asset transfers between utilities and their affiliates 
m monongahela power company and subsidiaries potomac edison and other maryland natural gas and electric utilities have noted an appeal of the circuit court s decision to maryland s court of special appeals 
the court of appeals  maryland s highest court  assumed jurisdiction over the appeal 
after the filing of briefs  the court of appeals heard oral arguments on january  the maryland psc also has initiated a proceeding  case no 
 to investigate certain affiliated activities of potomac edison and has also docketed similar proceedings for maryland s other natural gas and electric companies 
case no 
is pending before a maryland psc hearing examiner 
the maryland psc has initiated a proceeding  case no 
 to investigate potomac edison s proposed revisions to its line extension charges and policies for non residential customers 
the maryland psc delegated the proceeding to the hearing examiner division 
the hearing examiner held a prehearing conference on january   and established a procedural schedule 
the parties are entering into settlement discussions 
by letter order dated december   the maryland psc directed parties to commence meetings on january   on the status of the provision of default service 
potomac edison will participate in those meetings 
pennsylvania activities as of january   all electricity customers in pennsylvania have the right to choose their electric generation supplier 
the number of customers who have switched to another supplier and the amount of electrical load transferred in pennsylvania exceed that of any other state 
however  west penn had retained more than percent of its pennsylvania customers as of december  as part of west penn s restructuring settlement in pennsylvania  west penn retains the obligation to serve all customers who choose not to select an alternate supplier provider of last resort at rates that are capped at levels 
the generation rates are capped through environmental issues the environmental protection agency s epa nitrogen oxides nox state implementation plan sip call regulation has been under litigation  and on march   the district of columbia circuit court of appeals issued a decision that upheld the regulation 
however  state and industry litigants filed an appeal of that decision in april on june   the court denied the request for the appeal 
although the court did issue an order to delay the compliance date from may   until may   both the maryland and pennsylvania state rules to implement the epa nox sip call regulation still require compliance by may  west virginia has issued a proposed rule that would require compliance by may  however  the epa section petition regulation also requires the same level of nox reductions as the epa nox sip call regulation with a may   compliance date 
the epa section petition rule is also under litigation in th e district court of columbia circuit court of appeals 
a court decision in may upheld the rule 
in august  the court issued an order that suspends the section petition rule may   compliance date pending epa review of the growth factors used to calculate the state nox budgets 
the company s compliance with such stringent regulations will require the installation of expensive post combustion control technologies on most of its power stations 
the company s construction forecast includes the expenditure of million of capital costs during the through period to comply with these regulations 
m monongahela power company and subsidiaries on august   allegheny energy received a letter from the epa requiring it to provide certain information on the following electric generating stations albright  armstrong  fort martin  harrison  hatfield s ferry  mitchell  pleasants  rivesville  r 
paul smith  and willow island 
allegheny energy supply and the company now own these electric generating stations 
the letter requested information under section of the federal clean air act to determine compliance with the act and state implementation plan requirements  including potential application of federal new source review nsr 
in general  these standards can require the installation of additional air pollution control equipment upon the major modification of an existing facility 
allegheny energy submitted these records in january the eventual outcome of the epa investigation is unknown 
similar inquiries have been made of other electric utilities and have resulted in enforcement proceedings being brought in many cases 
the company believes its generating facilities have been operating in accordance with the clean air act and the rules implementing the act 
the experience of other utilities  however  suggests that  in recent years  the epa may well have revised its interpretation of the rules regarding the determination of whether an action at a facility constitutes routine maintenance  which would not trigger the requirements of the nsr  or a major modification of the facility  which would require compliance with the nsr 
if federal nsr were to be applied to these generating stations  in addition to the possible imposition of fines  compliance would entail significant expenditures 
in connection with the deregulation of generation  the company has agreed to rate caps in each of its jurisdictions  and there are no provisions under those arrangements to increase rates to cover such expenditures 
in december  the epa issued a decision to regulate coal and oil fired electric utility mercury emissions under title iii  section of the clean air act amendments 
the epa plans to issue a proposed regulation by december and a final regulation by december the timing and level of required mercury emission reductions are unknown at this time 
in the normal course of business  the company becomes involved in various legal proceedings 
the company does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will have a material effect on its financial position

derivative instruments and hedging activities in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
was subsequently amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
an amendment of fasb statement no 
 and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
effective january   the company implemented the requirements of these accounting standards 
these standards establish accounting and reporting requirements for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
they require that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the standards require that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in earnings or other comprehensive income and requires that a company formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
is expected to increase the volatility in entities reported earnings and other comprehensive income 
m monongahela power company and subsidiaries as of december   the company had no financial instruments  commodity contracts  or other commitments that required recognition as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value under the provisions of sfas quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates 
the commodity price risk exposure results from market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity and natural gas as discussed below 
the interest rate risk exposure results from changes in interest rates related to variable and fixed rate debt 
the company is mandated by allegheny energy s board of directors to engage in a program that systematically identifies  measures  evaluates  and actively manages and reports on market driven risks 
allegheny energy has a corporate energy risk policy adopted by allegheny energy s board of directors and monitored by a risk management committee chaired by allegheny energy s chief executive officer and composed of members of senior management 
an independent risk management group within allegheny energy actively measures and monitors the risk exposures to ensure compliance with the policy and it is periodically reviewed 
as part of the company s efforts to spur deregulation in west virginia  the company agreed to terminate its expanded net energy cost fuel clause effective july  however  as described under state deregulation efforts  the west virginia deregulation process remains stalled 
as a result  the company is subject to capped rates from a revenue standpoint without the existence of a fuel clause to offset fluctuations in the market price of fuel and natural gas 
in order to manage the company s financial exposure to these price fluctuations  the company routinely enters into contracts  such as fuel and natural gas purchase commitments in order to reduce its risk exposure 
to the extent that the company purchases fuel and natural gas at significantly higher prices  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
as a result of the company s restructuring plan in ohio  the company unbundled its rates in ohio to reflect three separate charges a generation or supply charge  a competitive transition charge ctc  and t d charges 
the generation rates applied to customers not choosing an alternate generation supplier are capped through a transition period that ends december  pursuant to agreements  allegheny energy supply provides the company with the amount of electricity needed for those ohio customers not choosing an alternate generation supplier during the transition period 
the original rate schedule for these agreements  effective through december   established fixed purchase prices corresponding to the capped generation rates charged to customers not electing an alternate generation supplier 
thus  the cost of purchased electricity was recovered through the capped generation rates charged to customers 
under a revised rate schedule approved by the ferc effective january   a portion of the electricity purchased from allegheny energy supply now has a market based pricing component that could result in higher electricity prices when market prices exceed the fixed prices corresponding to the capped generation rates 
purchased electricity prices would never be set below the established fixed prices 
the amount of electricity purchased under this rate schedule that is subject to market prices escalates each year through to the extent that the company purchases electricity from allegheny energy supply at market prices that exceed the established fixed prices  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
m monongahela power company and subsidiaries new accounting standards in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these standards changed the accounting for business combinations and goodwill in two significant ways 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  use of the pooling of interests method will be prohibited 
sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on the company 
sfas no 
changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
amortization of goodwill  including goodwill recorded in past business combinations  ceased on january  goodwill will now be tested at least annually for impairment 
intangible assets other than goodwill will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment 
as of december   the company had million of goodwill 
the company had goodwill amortization in of million 
the company is in the process of evaluating the effect of adopting sfas no 
on its results of operations and financial position and plans to reflect the results of this evaluation in its first quarter financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this standard  which the company will adopt on january   requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability will be accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost will be depreciated over the useful life of the asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either will settle the obligation for its recorded amount or incur a gain or loss upon settlement 
the company will be evaluating the effect of adopting sfas no 
on its results of operations and financial position prior to its adoption of the standard 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this standard  which the company adopted on january   establishes one accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  including discontinued operations  and carries forward the general impairment provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no

on november   the maryland psc approved the power sales agreement between the company and the winning bidder covering the sale of the aes warrior run output to the wholesale market for the period january   through december  in november  the maryland psc approved a further power sales agreement between the company and allegheny energy supply  the winning bidder  covering the sale of the aes warrior run output to the wholesale market for the period january   through december  the aes warrior run cogeneration project was developed under the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa and achieved commercial operation on february  under the terms of the maryland deregulation plan approved in  the revenues from the sale of the aes warrior run output are used to offset the capacity and energy costs the company pays to the aes warrior run cogeneration project before determining amounts to be recovered from maryland customers 
effective with bills rendered on or after january   there was an increase in maryland base rates 
this increase is a result of the phase in of the rate increase approved by the maryland psc in october pursuant to a settlement agreement  which includes recognition and dollar for dollar recovery of costs to be incurred from the aes warrior run purpa project 
the maryland psc approved rates to each customer class on december  under the terms of the agreement  the company increased its rates about four percent in each of the years   and a million total revenue increase during through 
the increases were designed to recover additional costs of about million  over the period  for capacity purchases from the project net of alleged over earnings of million for the same period 
the agreement also requires that the company share with customers percent of earnings above an percent return on equity for and as a result  percen t of the amount above the threshold earnings amount  or million applicable to  was distributed to m the potomac edison company and subsidiaries customers in the form of an earnings sharing credit  effective june   through april  an earnings sharing credit of million applicable to was distributed to customers from september  through january  effective with bills rendered on or after january   there was a decrease in maryland distribution rates 
this decrease  or customer choice credit  is a result of implementing the rate reductions called for in the settlement agreement approved in december under the terms of the agreement covering stranded cost quantification mechanism  price protection mechanism  and unbundled rates  the company decreased its rates seven percent for residential customers and one half of one percent for the majority of commercial and industrial customers 
the customer choice credit will remain in effect until a total of million approximately million annually has been credited to residential customers and a total of million approximately million annually has been credited to commercial and industrial customers 
additionally  since the time the maryland psc approved the rate reductions outlined above  the environmental surcharge has increased and the electric universal surcharge has b een introduced  both of which must be recovered under the company s distribution rate cap consistent with the settlement agreement 
accordingly  distribution rates have been further reduced by million from the previously approved rates in the settlement agreement 
the distribution rate cap for all customers is effective through regional transmission organization rto on march   allegheny energy and the pennsylvania new jersey maryland interconnection  llc pjm filed documents with the ferc to expand the pjm transmission system and energy market through the creation of pjm west 
the filing represents collaboration among allegheny energy  pjm  and numerous stakeholders 
allegheny energy and pjm have asked the ferc to confirm that pjm west satisfies the ferc s requirements for a rto as set forth in order no 
under the pjm west proposal  allegheny energy s regulated utility subsidiaries will transfer operational control over their transmission system to pjm 
allegheny energy will adopt pjm s transmission pricing methodology  including pjm s congestion management system 
in addition  pjm will expand its day ahead and real time energy markets to include pjm west 
as a result  energy suppliers will be able to reach consumers anywhere within the expanded pjm pjm west market at a single transmission rate  instead of paying multiple transmission rates as they do today 
allegheny energy s filing also requested authorization to recover anticipated lost transmission revenues of approximately million annually and pjm west start up expenses billed to allegheny energy by pjm of approximately million annually through by order dated july   the ferc conditionally approved pjm west  subject to a compliance filing clarifying certain terms and conditions of pjm west and providing additional support for allegheny energy s claims for lost transmission revenues and start up expenses 
pjm and allegheny energy submitted their compliance filing on september  on january   the ferc authorized allegheny energy and pjm to proceed with pjm west effective march  the ferc s order set for hearing the question whether allegheny energy had adequately supported its claim to recover anticipated lost transmission revenues and start up expenses  and created uncertainty as to whether the ferc intended to initiate a general investigation into allegheny energy s transmission rates  which could potentially lead to an overall reduction to its transmission revenues 
allegheny energy requested clarification  and on march   the ferc issued a further order explaining that its january  order did not initiate a general investigation of allegheny energy s transmission revenues 
accordingly  in light of the limited scope of the hearing ordered by the ferc  allegheny energy has elected to proceed with pjm west effective april  allegheny energy anticipates the formation of pjm west will enhance its ability to compete for power sales in the expanded pjm pjm west market area

m the potomac edison company and subsidiaries sales and revenues percentage changes in revenues and kilowatt hour kwh sales in and by major retail customer classes were vs vs revenues kwh revenues kwh residential commercial industrial total retail the changes in residential kwh sales are more weather sensitive than the other classes 
the changes in residential kwh sales for and were due primarily to an increase in the number of customers served 
the growth in the number of residential customers was percent and percent in and  respectively 
the revenue increase for was the result of an increase in customers served coupled with an increase in the average rate cents per kwh 
the revenue increase in was slightly offset by reductions applied to certain customers revenues 
the reductions included credits to customer bills resulting from conditions within the maryland settlement agreements and adjustments to revenues related to the over recovery from the aes warrior run cogeneration project 
commercial kwh sales are also affected by weather  but to a lesser extent than residential 
the increases in commercial kwh sales for and were due primarily to the growth in the number of customers served  with increases of percent and percent in and  respectively 
the increase in was partially offset by a decrease in customer usage 
the increase in industrial kwh sales for was due to an increase in usage by a major customer in the primary metal industry and several customers in the food products industry 
the increase in industrial kwh sales for was due to an increase in usage by customers in the primary metal industry and in the stone  glass  clay  and concrete industry 
in addition to usage and customers served  revenues for the residential  commercial  and industrial classes are affected by an aes warrior run surcharge 
for these revenue classes  the aes warrior run surcharges have decreased for the changes for the aes warrior run surcharges are the result of the company selling aes warrior run output into the wholesale energy market in and part of the company did not sell the aes warrior run output into the wholesale market for the first six months of for additional information on the aes warrior run project  see rate matters beginning on page the decrease in revenues in for commercial and industrial customers was due primarily to a decrease in the fuel portion of customer bills  a decrease in surcharge revenues applicable to recovery of costs related to purchased power from the aes warrior run cogeneration project  a decrease in virginia base rates  and  to a lesser extent  maryland deregulation  which gave maryland customers of the company the ability to choose another energy supplier effective july  in october  the maryland psc approved a settlement agreement for the company 
under the terms of that agreement  the company increased its rates about four percent in  and a million total revenue increase during through 
revenues reflect not only changes in kwh sales and base rate changes  but also any changes in revenues from fuel and energy cost adjustment clauses fuel clauses 
effective july   a fuel clause ceased to exist for the company s west virginia jurisdiction and ceased to exist for the company s virginia jurisdiction effective august m the potomac edison company and subsidiaries  through june   changes in fuel revenues had no effect on the company s net income because increases and decreases in fuel and purchased power costs and sales of transmissions services and bulk power were passed on to customers by adjustment of customers bills through a fuel clause 
effective july   the company assumed the risk and benefits of changes in fuel and purchased power costs and sales of transmission services and bulk power in its maryland and west virginia jurisdictions  and on august   for its virginia jurisdiction 
wholesale and other revenues  including affiliates were as follows millions of dollars wholesale customers affiliated companies street lighting and other deferred revenues total wholesale and other revenues wholesale customers are cooperatives and municipalities that own their distribution systems and buy all or part of their bulk power needs from the company under the ferc regulation 
competition in the wholesale market for electricity was initiated by the national energy policy act of  which permits wholesale generators  utility owned and otherwise  and wholesale customers to request from owners of bulk power transmission facilities a commitment to supply transmission services 
wholesale customer revenue for and remained relatively flat as compared to and  respectively 
revenues from sales to affiliated companies represent sales of energy and intercompany allocations of generating capacity  generation spinning reserves  and transmission services pursuant to a power supply agreement among the company and the other regulated utility subsidiaries of allegheny energy 
the decrease in sales to affiliated companies for as compared to was the result of the transfer of the company s generating capacity to allegheny energy supply on august  the increase in revenues from sales to affiliated companies for as compared to was the result of power sales to allegheny energy supply 
transmission services and bulk power sales include transactions of transmission services  bulk power  and other energy services to power marketers and other utilities 
transmission services and bulk sales for   and were as follows millions of dollars bulk power transmission and other energy services to nonaffiliated companies total the costs of purchased power and revenues from sales to power marketers and other utilities  including transmission services  were recovered from or credited to customers under fuel and energy cost recovery procedures 
the impact to the fuel and energy cost recovery clauses may be either positive or negative depending on whether the company is a net buyer or seller of electricity during such periods and the open commitments that exist at such times 
the impact of such price volatility was insignificant to the company in the first six months of because changes are passed to customers through operation of fuel clauses 
effective july   the fuel clause was discontinued in the company s maryland and west virginia jurisdictions  and was discontinued for its virginia jurisdiction effective august  the discontinuation of fuel clauses will increase the risk associated with the volatility of earnings for the company 
with the discontinuation of the fuel clauses  the company assumes the risk and benefits of changes in fuel and purchased power costs and sales of transmission services and bulk power in its maryland  west virginia and virginia jurisdictions 
m the potomac edison company and subsidiaries revenue from transmission services and bulk power sales increased in and by million and million  respectively 
the increase is attributable to the company selling the aes warrior run output into the wholesale energy market beginning in the latter half of operating expenses fuel expense was eliminated for and decreased by million for  as compared to  as a result of the transfer of the company s  mw generating capacity to allegheny energy supply on august  purchased power and exchanges  net  represents power purchases from and exchanges with other companies  including affiliated companies and  purchases from qualified facilities under purpa and consists of the following items millions of dollars nonaffiliated transactions purchased power other from purpa generation power exchanges  net affiliated transactions energy and capacity charges purchased power and exchanges  net purchased power and exchanges  net increased by million and million for and  respectively 
the increase for both years is primarily the result of the company transferring its generating capacity to allegheny energy supply  thus requiring the company to purchase power in order to meet its retail load requirements in maryland and virginia 
the company s method of satisfying its west virginia load requirement is discussed below 
purchased power from purpa generation for remained relatively flat as compared to the increase in purchased power from purpa generation for as compared to was primarily due to the start of commercial operations of the aes warrior run cogeneration project on february   in the company s maryland service territory 
the maryland psc approved the company s full recovery of the aes warrior run purchased power costs as part of the september   settlement agreement 
accordingly  the company defers  as a component of other operation expenses  the difference between revenues collected related to aes warrior run and the cost of the aes warrior run purchased power 
the increases in other operation expenses for and of million and million  respectively  are primarily the result of leasing of generating assets 
the transfer of the company s generating assets to allegheny energy supply on august   included the company s assets serving west virginia customers 
a portion of these assets has been leased back by the company to serve its west virginia jurisdictional retail customers 
the original lease term was for one year 
the company and allegheny energy supply have mutually agreed to continue the lease beyond august  the ultimate treatment of the company s west virginia jurisdictional generating assets will be resolved when the west virginia legislature addresses implementation of deregulation 
for the years ended and  rental expense from this arrangement totaled million and million  respectively 
the increase in was offset by a reduction in expenses as a result of the transfer of the generation assets on au gust  the decreases in maintenance expenses in and of million and million  respectively  were due primarily to the transfer of the company s generating assets to allegheny energy supply 
until the august   transfer of generating assets  maintenance expenses represented costs incurred to maintain the power stations  the t d system  and general plant 
these costs reflected routine maintenance of equipment m the potomac edison company and subsidiaries and rights of way  as well as planned repairs and unplanned expenditures  primarily from forced outages at the power stations and periodic storm damage on the t d system 
effective with the august  transfer of generating assets  the company s maintenance costs no longer reflect power station related maintenance expenses 
variations in maintenance expense result primarily from unplanned events and planned projects  which vary in timing and magnitude depending upon the length of time equipment has been in service without an overhaul and the amount of work found necessary when the equipment is dismantled 
the decreases in depreciation and amortization expense in and of million and million  respectively  reflects the transfer of the company s generating assets to allegheny energy supply  offset  in part  by depreciation of new capital additions 
the decreases in taxes other than income taxes for and of million and million  respectively  were primarily due to lower west virginia business and occupation taxes and property taxes 
the decrease is the result of the transfer of the company s generating assets to allegheny energy supply 
the decreases in federal and state income taxes for and of million and million  respectively  resulted from a decrease in taxable income 
note e to the consolidated financial statements provides a further analysis of income tax expense 
other income and deductions the decreases in other income  net  for and were primarily due to a decrease in the company s portion of allegheny generating company s agc earnings due to the transfer of the company s ownership interest in agc to allegheny energy supply on august   coupled with a decrease in interest income and an increase in losses associated with maryland coal brokerage activities 
interest charges the decrease in interest charges for was due primarily to a reduction in long term debt outstanding related to the company s release from co obligor status with allegheny energy supply in december on million of pollution control notes 
allegheny energy supply assumed these notes in conjunction with the company s transfer of generating assets to allegheny energy supply 
interest charges also decreased as a result of the maturity of million of the company s percent series first mortgage bonds in march the decrease in interest charges for was due to a reduction in average long term debt outstanding  offset by an increase in short term debt 
extraordinary item the extraordinary charge in of million million after tax was required to recognize million million after tax for the write off of unrecoverable regulatory assets and the recognition of rate stabilization obligations due to west virginia deregulation  and an additional million million after tax due to write offs associated with deregulation in virginia 
the extraordinary charge in of million million after taxes was required to reflect a write off of certain disallowances in the maryland psc s december order

significant continuing issues electric energy competition the electricity supply segment of the electric industry in the united states is becoming increasingly competitive 
the national energy policy act of deregulated the wholesale exchange of power within the electric industry by permitting the ferc to compel electric utilities to allow third parties to sell electricity to wholesale customers over their transmission systems 
the company and its parent  allegheny energy  continue to be an advocate of federal legislation to remove artificial barriers to competition in electricity markets  avoid regional dislocations  and ensure a level playing field 
in addition  with the wholesale electricity market becoming more competitive  certain states have taken active steps toward allowing retail customers the right to choose their electricity supplier 
allegheny energy is at the forefront of state implemented retail competition  having negotiated settlement agreements in all of the states that allegheny power serves 
maryland  pennsylvania  ohio  and virginia have retail choice programs in place 
west virginia s legislature has approved a deregulation plan pending additional legislation regarding tax revenues for state and local governments and allowing implementation 
no final legislative action was taken in regarding implementation of the deregulation plan 
although the west virginia legislature may reconsider the deregulation plan in the january to march session  the current climate regarding restructuring makes it unlikely that the existing plan will be advanced in the regulatory environment applicable to allegheny energy s generation and t d businesses will continue to undergo substantial changes on both the federal and state level 
these changes have significantly affected the nature of the electric industry and the manner in which its participants conduct their business 
moreover  existing statutes and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted  new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to allegheny energy or its facilities  and future changes in laws and regulations may have an effect on allegheny energy in ways that cannot be predicted 
some markets  like california  have experienced interruptions of supply and price volatility  which have been the subject of a significant amount of press coverage  much of which has been critical of the restructuring initiatives 
in some markets  including california  government agencies and other interested parties have made proposals to re regulate areas of these markets that have been deregulated  and  in california  legislation has been passed placing a moratorium on the sale of generating facilities by regulated utilities 
proposals to re regulate the wholesale power market have been made at the federal level 
proposals of this sort  and legislative or other attention to the electric power restructuring process in the states in which allegheny energy currently operates  or may in the future operate  may cause deregulation to be delayed  discontinued  or reversed  which could have a material effect on allegheny energy s operations and strategies 
m the potomac edison company and subsidiaries the recent bankruptcy filing by enron corporation enron may affect the regulatory and legislative process 
in response to the enron bankruptcy filing and the september terrorists attacks  financial markets have been disrupted in general  and the availability and cost of capital for allegheny energy s business and that of its competitors has been adversely affected 
following the enron bankruptcy filing  credit ratings agencies reviewed the capital structure and earnings power of energy companies  including allegheny energy 
these events have constrained the capital available to the industry and could adversely affect allegheny energy s access to funding for its operations 
activities at the federal level the terrorists attacks of september   have altered the agenda of the th congress 
in fact  some legislative initiatives have been delayed or postponed since that date because the congress and the bush administration have been focused on responding to these attacks 
however  part of that response may well be the consideration of energy security legislation currently in development 
allegheny energy is lobbying for the inclusion of important electricity restructuring provisions in this legislation  including the repeal or significant revision of puhca  as well as for critical infrastructure protection legislation 
prior to the attack  two primary bills had been introduced in the us senate s 
 by former energy and natural resources committee chairman senator frank murkowski of alaska  and s 
 by the committee s new chairman  senator jeff bingaman of new mexico 
provisions from these bills could be included in the new energy legislation

 legislation to repeal puhca 
maryland activities on june   the maryland psc approved the transfer of the generating assets of the company to allegheny energy supply 
the transfer was completed in august maryland customers of the company have had the right to choose an alternate electric supplier since july  while few customers have switched suppliers in the company s service territory  some retail competition is occurring in other portions of the state 
on july   the maryland psc issued a restrictive order imposing standards of conduct for transactions between maryland utilities and their affiliates 
among other things  the order restricts sharing of employees between utilities and affiliates  announces the maryland psc s intent to impose a royalty fee to compensate the utility for the use by an affiliate of the utility s name and or logo and for other intangible or unqualified benefits  and requires asymmetric pricing for asset transfers between utilities and their affiliates 
asymmetric pricing requires that transfers of assets from the regulated utility to an affiliate be recorded at the greater of book cost or market value while transfers of assets from the affiliate to the regulated utility be recorded at the lesser of book costs or market value 
the company  along with substantially all of maryland s natural gas and electric utilities  filed a circuit court petition for judicial review and a motion for stay of the order 
on april   the circuit court issued its decision affirming much of the maryland psc s order  but remanding portions of the order to the maryland psc  including the requirement for asymmetric pricing for asset transfers between utilities and their affiliates 
m the potomac edison company and subsidiaries the company and other maryland natural gas and electric utilities have noted an appeal of the circuit court s decision to maryland s court of special appeals

virginia activities the virginia electric utility restructuring act restructuring act became law on march  all state utilities were required to submit a restructuring plan by january   to be effective on january  on december   the virginia scc approved the company s phase ii of the functional separation plan 
in august  the company transferred its virginia jurisdictional generating assets  excluding the hydroelectric assets located within virginia  to allegheny energy supply at book value 
the virginia hydroelectric assets were transferred on june  to green valley hydro 
customer choice was implemented for all customers in the company s service territory beginning on january  the restructuring act was amended during the general assembly legislative session to direct the virginia scc to prepare for legislative approval  a plan for competitive metering and billing and to authorize the virginia scc to implement a consumer education program on electric choice  funded through its regulatory tax 
on december   the virginia scc issued a report on competitive metering and billing 
its recommendations include allowing licensed electricity suppliers to provide billing services  with the customer selecting its preferred billing option 
the virginia scc also recommended that legislative action on competitive metering be deferred pending further study  due to the complexities of the issue and limited competitive metering activities nationally 
on may   the virginia scc initiated proceedings to establish rules and regulations for consolidated billing services  competitive metering  and customer minimum stay periods 
various rulemaking proceedings to implement customer choice are ongoing before the virginia scc  including an application by the company to participate in a regional transmission entity pjm west 
west virginia activities electric restructuring in west virginia remains unresolved and awaits further legislative action 
in january  the west virginia psc submitted a restructuring plan to the legislature for approval that would open full retail competition on january  on march   the west virginia legislature approved the west virginia psc s plan  but assigned the tax issues surrounding the plan to a legislative subcommittee for further study 
the start date of competition is contingent upon the necessary tax changes being made and implementation being approved by the legislature 
no final legislative action was taken in regarding implementation of the deregulation plan 
although the west virginia legislature may reconsider in the january to march session  the current climate regarding restructuring makes it unlikely that the existing plan will be advanced in m the potomac edison company and subsidiaries as approved by the west virginia psc  the company transferred its generating assets to allegheny energy supply in august in accordance with the same restructuring agreement  the company and monongahela power implemented a commercial and industrial rate reduction program on july  the status of electric energy competition in ohio and pennsylvania in which affiliates of the company serve are as follows ohio activities the ohio general assembly passed legislation in to restructure its electric utility industry 
as of january   all of the state s electricity customers were able to choose their electricity supplier  beginning a five year transition to market rates 
residential customers are guaranteed a five percent cut in the generation portion of their rate 
monongahela power reached a stipulated agreement with major parties on a transition plan to bring electric choice to its  ohio customers 
none of monongahela power s ohio customers have switched to another supplier 
the restructuring plan allowed monongahela power to transfer its ohio and ferc jurisdictional generating assets to allegheny energy supply at book value on or after january  that transfer was made on june  pennsylvania activities as of january   all electricity customers in pennsylvania have the right to choose their electric generation supplier 
the number of customers who have switched to another supplier and the amount of electrical load transferred in pennsylvania exceed that of any other state 
however  west penn had retained more than percent of its pennsylvania customers as of december  as part of west penn s restructuring settlement in pennsylvania  west penn retains the obligation to serve all customers who choose not to select an alternate supplier provider of last resort at rates that are capped at levels 
the generation rates are capped through derivative instruments and hedging activities in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
was subsequently amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
an amendment of fasb statement no 
 and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
effective january   the company implemented the requirements of these accounting standards 
these standards establish accounting and reporting requirements for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
they require that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the standards require that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in earnings or other comprehensive income and requires that a company formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
is expected to increase the volatility in entities reported earnings and other comprehensive income 
at december   the company had no financial instruments  commodity contracts  or other commitments that required recognition as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value under the provisions of sfas m the potomac edison company and subsidiaries quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates 
the commodity price risk exposure results from market fluctuations in the price of electricity as discussed below 
the interest rate risk exposure results from changes in interest rates related to variable and fixed rate debt 
the company is mandated by allegheny energy s board of directors to engage in a program that systematically identifies  measures  evaluates  and actively manages and reports on market driven risks 
allegheny energy has a corporate energy risk policy adopted by allegheny energy s board of directors and monitored by a risk management committee chaired by allegheny energy s chief executive officer and composed of members of senior management 
an independent risk management group within allegheny energy actively measures and monitors the risk exposures to ensure compliance with the policy and it is periodically reviewed 
as a result of the company s restructuring plan  the company unbundled its rates to reflect three separate charges a generation or supply charge  a competitive transition charge ctc  and t d charges 
the generation rates applied to customers not choosing an alternate generation supplier are capped through a transition period that ends december  pursuant to agreements  allegheny energy supply provides the company with the total amount of electricity needed for those customers not choosing an alternate generation supplier during the transition period 
the original rate schedule for these agreements  effective through december   established fixed purchase prices corresponding to the capped generation rates charged to customers not electing an alternate generation supplier 
thus  the cost of purchased electricity was recovered through the capped generation rates charged to customers 
under a revised rate schedule approved by the ferc effective january   a portion of the electricity purchased from allegheny energy supply now has a market based pricing component that could result in higher electricity prices when market prices exceed the fixed prices corresponding to the capped generation rates 
purchased electricity prices would never be set below the established fixed prices 
the amount of electricity purchased under this rate schedule that is subject to market prices escalates each year through june   in virginia and december   in maryland from percent of total purchases in to approximately percent in 
to the extent that the company purchases electricity from allegheny energy supply at market prices that exceed the established fixed prices  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
new accounting standards in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these standards will change the accounting for business combinations and goodwill in two significant ways 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  use of the pooling of interests method will be prohibited 
sfas no 
is not expected to a have a material effect on the company 
sfas no 
changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
amortization of goodwill  including goodwill recorded in past business combinations  ceased on january  subsequently  an entity s goodwill will be tested at least annually for impairment 
intangible assets other than goodwill will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment 
as of december   the company had no goodwill or intangible assets 
m the potomac edison company and subsidiaries in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this standard  which the company will adopt on january   requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability will be accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost will be depreciated over the useful life of the asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either will settle the obligation for its recorded amount or incur a gain or loss upon settlement 
the company will be evaluating the effect of adopting sfas no 
on its results of operations and financial position prior to its adoption of the standard 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this standard  which the company adopted on january   establishes one accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  including discontinued operations  and carries forward the general impairment provisions of sfas no

the company s long term debt due within one year at december   was million of transition bonds and million of medium term debt 
short term debt the company had no short term debt outstanding at december   and significant continuing issues electric energy competition the electricity supply segment of the energy industry in the united states is becoming increasingly competitive 
the national energy policy act of m west penn power company and subsidiaries deregulated the wholesale exchange of power within the electric industry by permitting the ferc to compel electric utilities to allow third parties to sell electricity to wholesale customers over their transmission systems 
the company and its parent  allegheny energy  continue to be an advocate of federal legislation to remove artificial barriers to competition in electricity markets  avoid regional dislocations  and ensure a level playing field 
in addition to the wholesale electricity market becoming more competitive  certain states have taken active steps toward allowing retail customers the right to choose their electricity supplier 
allegheny energy is at the forefront of state implemented retail competition  having negotiated settlement agreements in all of the states that monongahela power  potomac edison  and the company serve 
pennsylvania  maryland  virginia  and ohio have retail choice programs in place 
west virginia s legislature has approved a deregulation plan pending additional legislation regarding tax revenues for state and local governments and allowing implementation 
no final legislative action was taken in regarding implementation of the deregulation plan 
although the west virginia legislature may reconsider in the january to march session  the current climate regarding restructuring makes it unlikely that the existing plan will be advanced in the regulatory environment applicable to allegheny energy s generation and t d businesses will continue to undergo substantial changes on both the federal and state level 
these changes have significantly affected the nature of the electric industry and the manner in which its participants conduct their business 
moreover  existing statutes and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted  new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to allegheny energy or its facilities  and future changes in laws and regulations may have an effect on allegheny energy in ways that cannot be predicted 
some markets  like california  have experienced interruptions of supply and price volatility  which have been the subject of a significant amount of press coverage  much of which has been critical of the restructuring initiatives 
in some markets  including california  government agencies and other interested parties have made proposals to re regulate areas of these markets that have been deregulated  and  in california  legislation has been passed placing a moratorium on the sale of generating facilities by regulated utilities 
proposals to re regulate the wholesale power market have been made at the federal level 
proposals of this sort  and legislative or other attention to the electric power restructuring process in the states in which allegheny energy currently operates  or may in the future operate  may cause deregulation to be delayed  discontinued  or reversed  which could have a material effect on allegheny energy s operations and strategies 
the recent bankruptcy filing by enron corporation enron may affect the regulatory and legislative process 
in response to the enron bankruptcy filing and the september terrorists attacks  financial markets have been disrupted in general  and the availability and cost of capital for allegheny energy s business and that of its competitors has been adversely affected 
following the enron bankruptcy filing  credit ratings agencies reviewed the capital structure and earnings power of energy companies  including allegheny energy 
these events have constrained the capital available to the industry and could adversely affect allegheny energy s access to funding for its operations 
activities at the federal level the terrorists attacks of september   have altered the agenda of the th congress 
in fact  some legislative initiatives have been delayed or postponed since that date because the congress and the bush administration have been focused on responding to these attacks 
however  part of that response may well be the consideration of energy security legislation currently in development 
allegheny energy is lobbying for the inclusion of important electricity restructuring m west penn power company and subsidiaries provisions in this legislation  including the repeal or significant revision of puhca  as well as for critical infra structure protection legislation 
prior to the attack  two primary bills had been introduced in the us senate s 
 by former energy and natural resources committee chairman senator frank murkowski of alaska  and s 
 by the committee s new chairman  senator jeff bingaman of new mexico 
provisions from these bills could be included in the new energy legislation 
the primary house committee of jurisdiction  energy and commerce  initially passed the president s national energy security proposal and is only now considering accompanying electricity restructuring legislation 
among issues that are being addressed in this legislation are the repeal or significant revision of puhca and section mandatory purchase provisions of purpa 
allegheny energy continues to advocate the repeal of puhca and section of purpa on the grounds that they are obsolete and anticompetitive and th at purpa results in utility customers paying above market prices for power 
separately  the senate banking committee in april approved s 
 legislation to repeal puhca 
pennsylvania activities as of january   all electricity customers in pennsylvania have the right to choose their electric generation supplier 
the number of customers who have switched to another supplier and the amount of electrical load transferred in pennsylvania exceed that of any other state 
however  the company had retained more than percent of its pennsylvania customers as of december  as part of the company s restructuring settlement in pennsylvania  the company retains the obligation to serve all customers who choose not to select an alternative supplier provider of last resort at rates that are capped at levels 
the generation rates are capped through the status of electric energy competition in maryland  ohio  virginia  and west virginia in which affiliates of the company serve are as follows maryland activities on june   the maryland public service commission maryland psc approved the transfer of the generating assets of potomac edison to allegheny energy supply 
the transfer was completed in august maryland customers of potomac edison have had the right to choose an alternate electric supplier since july  while few customers have switched suppliers in potomac edison s service territory  some retail competition is occurring in other portions of the state 
on july   the maryland psc issued a restrictive order imposing standards of conduct for transactions between maryland utilities and their affiliates 
among other things  the order restricts sharing of employees between utilities and unregulated affiliates  announces the maryland psc s intent to impose a royalty fee to compensate the utility for the use by an affiliate of the utility s name and or logo and for other intangible or unqualified benefits  and requires asymmetric pricing for asset transfers between utilities and their affiliates 
asymmetric pricing requires that transfers of assets from the regulated utility to an affiliate be recorded at the greater of book cost or market value  while transfers of assets from the affiliate to the regulated utility be recorded at the lesser of book cost or market value 
potomac edison  along with substantially all of maryland s natural gas and electric utilities  filed a circuit court petition for judicial review and a motion for a stay of the order 
on april   the circuit court issued its decision affirming much of the maryland psc s order  but remanding portions of the order to the maryland psc  including the requirement for asymmetric pricing for asset transfers between utilities and their affiliates 
m west penn power company and subsidiaries potomac edison and other maryland natural gas and electric utilities have noted an appeal of the circuit court s decision to maryland s court of special appeals 
the court of appeals  maryland s highest court  assumed jurisdiction over the appeal 
after the filing of briefs  the court of appeals heard oral arguments on january  the maryland psc also has initiated a proceeding  case no 
 to investigate certain affiliated activities of potomac edison and has also docketed similar proceedings for maryland s other natural gas and electric companies 
case no 
is pending before a maryland psc hearing examiner 
the maryland psc has initiated a proceeding  case no 
 to investigate potomac edison s proposed revisions to its line extension charges and policies for non residential customers 
the maryland psc delegated the proceeding to the hearing examiner division 
the hearing examiner held a prehearing conference on january   and established a procedural schedule 
the parties are entering into settlement discussions 
by letter order dated december   the maryland psc directed parties to commence meetings on january   on the status of the provision of default service 
potomac edison will participate in those meetings 
ohio activities the ohio general assembly passed legislation in to restructure its electric utility industry 
as of january   all of the state s electricity consumers were able to choose their electricity supplier  beginning a five year transition to market rates 
residential customers are guaranteed a five percent reduction in the generation portion of their rate 
monongahela power reached a stipulated agreement with major parties on a transition plan to bring electric choice to its  ohio customers 
none of monongahela power s ohio customers have switched to another supplier 
the restructuring plan allowed monongahela power to transfer its ohio and ferc jurisdictional generating assets to allegheny energy supply at book value 
that transfer was made on june  virginia activities the virginia electric utility restructuring act restructuring act became law on march  all state utilities were required to submit a restructuring plan by january   to be effective on january  on december   the virginia state corporation commission virginia scc approved potomac edison s phase ii of the functional separation plan 
in august  potomac edison transferred its virginia jurisdictional generating assets  excluding the hydroelectric assets located within the state of virginia  to allegheny energy supply at book value 
customer choice was implemented for all customers in potomac edison s service territory beginning on january  the restructuring act was amended during the general assembly legislative session to direct the virginia scc to prepare for legislative approval a plan for competitive metering and billing and to authorize the virginia scc to implement a consumer education program on electric choice  funded through its regulatory tax 
on december   the virginia scc issued a report on competitive metering and billing 
its recommendations include allowing licensed electricity suppliers to provide billing services  with the customer selecting its preferred billing option 
the virginia scc also recommended that legislative action on competitive metering be deferred pending further study  due to the complexities of the issue and limited competitive metering activities nationally 
on may   the virginia scc initiated proceedings to establish rules and regulations for consolidated billing services  competitive metering  and customer minimum stay periods 
m west penn power company and subsidiaries various rulemaking proceedings to implement customer choice are ongoing before the virginia scc  including an application by potomac edison to participate in a regional transmission entity pjm west 
west virginia activities electric restructuring in west virginia remains unresolved and awaits further legislative action 
in january  the public service commission of west virginia west virginia psc submitted a restructuring plan to the legislature for approval that would open full retail competition on january  on march   the west virginia legislature approved the west virginia psc s plan  but assigned the tax issues surrounding the plan to a legislative subcommittee for further study 
the start date of competition is contingent upon the necessary tax changes being made and implementation being approved by the legislature 
no final legislative action was taken in regarding implementation of the deregulation plan 
although the west virginia legislature may reconsider in the january to march session  the current climate regarding restructuring makes it unlikely that the existing plan will be advanced in as approved by the west virginia psc  potomac edison transferred its generating assets to allegheny energy supply in august in accordance with the same restructuring agreement  potomac edison and monongahela power implemented a commercial and industrial rate reduction program on july  derivative instruments and hedging activities in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
was subsequently amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
an amendment of fasb statement no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
effective january   the company implemented the requirements of these accounting standards 
these standards establish accounting and reporting requirements for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
they require that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the standards require that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in earnings or other comprehensive income and requires that a company formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
is expected to increase the volatility in entities reported earnings and other comprehensive income 
as of december   the company had no financial instruments  commodity contracts  or other commitments that required recognition as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value under the provisions of sfas no 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates 
the commodity price risk exposure results from market fluctuations in the price of electricity as discussed below 
the interest rate risk exposure results from changes in interest rates related to variable and fixed rate debt 
the company is mandated by allegheny energy s board of directors to engage in a program that systematically identifies  measures  evaluates  and actively manages and reports on market driven risks 
m west penn power company and subsidiaries allegheny energy has a corporate energy risk policy adopted by allegheny energy s board of directors and monitored by a risk management committee chaired by allegheny energy s chief executive officer and composed of members of senior management 
an independent risk management group within allegheny energy actively measures and monitors the risk exposures to ensure compliance with the policy and it is periodically reviewed 
as a result of the company s restructuring plan  the company unbundled its rates to reflect three separate charges a generation or supply charge  a competitive transition charge ctc  and t d charges 
the generation rates applied to customers not choosing an alternate electricity supplier are capped through a transition period that ends december  pursuant to agreements  allegheny energy supply provides the company with the total amount of electricity needed for those customers not choosing an alternate electricity supplier during the transition period 
the original rate schedule for these agreements  effective through december   established fixed purchase prices corresponding to the capped generation rates charged to customers not electing an alternate electricity supplier 
thus  the cost of purchased electricity was recovered through the capped generation rates charged to customers 
under a revised rate schedule approved by the ferc effective january   a portion of the electricity purchased from allegheny energy supply now has a market based pricing component that could result in higher electricity prices when market prices exceed the fixed prices corresponding to the capped generation rates 
purchased electricity prices would never be set below the established fixed prices 
the amount of electricity purchased under this rate schedule that is subject to market prices escalates each year through from of total purchases in to approximately in 
to the extent that the company purchases electricity from allegheny energy supply at market prices that exceed the established fixed prices  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
in  the company incurred million of additional purchased electricity costs due to the market based pricing component of the revised rate schedule 
new accounting standards in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these standards changed the accounting for business combinations and goodwill in two significant ways 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  use of the pooling of interests method will be prohibited 
sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on the company 
sfas no 
changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
for entities with calendar year ends  amortization of goodwill  including goodwill recorded in past business combinations  ceased upon adoption of the standard on january  an entity s goodwill will now be tested at least annually for impairment 
intangible assets other than goodwill will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment 
as of december   the company had no goodwill but had intangible assets consisting primarily of software 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this standard  which the company will adopt on january   requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability will be accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost will be m west penn power company and subsidiaries depreciated over the useful life of the asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either will settle the obligation for its recorded amount or incur a gain or loss upon settlement 
the company will be evaluating the effect of adopting sfas no 
on its results of operations and financial position prior to its adoption of the standard 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this standard  which the company adopted on january   establishes one accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  including discontinued operations  and carries forward the general impairment provisions of sfas no

transfer of generating assets on june   monongahela power company monongahela power transferred its megawatts mw of ohio and the federal energy regulatory commission ferc jurisdictional generating assets to allegheny energy supply  at book value 
the transfer was approved by the public utilities commission of ohio ohio puc as part of a settlement that implemented a restructuring plan for monongahela power 
this restructuring plan allowed monongahela power s ohio customers to choose their generation supplier effective january  accordingly  monongahela power s interest in the common stock of the company decreased to from effective june  allegheny energy supply owns the remaining shares 
m allegheny generating company in march  the west virginia legislature passed house resolution approving an electric deregulation plan submitted by the public service commission of west virginia west virginia psc with certain modifications 
under the resolution  the implementation of the west virginia deregulation plan cannot occur until the legislature enacts certain tax changes regarding the preservation of tax revenues for state and local governments and other changes conforming to the plan and authorizing implementation 
the plan provides for all customers to have choice of a generation supplier and allows monongahela power to transfer  at book value  the west virginia portion of its generating assets  including its ownership share of common stock of monongahela power to allegheny energy supply 
no final legislative action was taken in regarding implementation of the deregulation plan 
although the west virginia legislature may reconsider the deregulation plan in the january to march session  the current climate regarding restructuring makes it unlikely that the existing plan will be advanced in on june   the west virginia psc issued an order regarding the transfer of the generating assets of monongahela power 
the june   order permits monongahela power to submit a petition to the west virginia psc seeking approval to transfer its west virginia generating assets prior to the implementation of the deregulation plan 
a filing before implementation of the deregulation plan is required to include commitments to the consumer and other protections contained in the deregulation plan 
on august   with a supplemental filing on october   monongahela power filed a petition seeking west virginia psc approval to transfer its west virginia jurisdictional generating assets to allegheny energy supply 
settlement discussions regarding the generating asset transfer are ongoing 
on july   allegheny energy received approval from the sec regarding the transfer of the generating assets of the potomac edison company potomac edison to allegheny energy supply 
state utility commissions in maryland  virginia  and west virginia approved the transfer of these assets as part of deregulation proceedings in those states 
the ferc also approved the transfer 
in august  allegheny energy transferred approximately  megawatts mw of its subsidiary potomac edison s maryland  virginia  and west virginia jurisdictional generating assets to allegheny energy supply at book value  including potomac edison s ownership share in the common stock of the company 
on november   the pennsylvania public utility commission pennsylvania puc approved a settlement agreement between west penn power company west penn and parties to west penn s restructuring proceedings related to legislation in pennsylvania to provide customer choice of electric suppliers and deregulate electricity generation 
the terms of the settlement agreement permitted west penn to transfer its generating assets to a separate legal entity at book value  contingent upon other regulatory approvals 
on november   west penn transferred its deregulated generating capacity  which included its ownership share in the common stock of the company  to allegheny energy supply 
during the period from november   through january   allegheny energy supply leased back to west penn one third of its generating assets  including one third of its ownership share in the company  providing west penn with the unlimited right to use those facilities to serve its r egulated load 
m allegheny generating company review of operations critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires the company to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies during the reported period 
the estimates require management s most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
the company s only operating assets are an undivided interest in the bath county virginia pumped storage hydroelectric station and its connecting transmission facilities 
the company has no plans for construction of any other major facilities 
pursuant to an agreement  monongahela power and allegheny energy supply the parents  buy all of the company s capacity in the station priced under a cost of service formula wholesale rate schedule approved by the ferc 
under this arrangement  the company recovers in revenues all of its operation and maintenance expenses  depreciation  taxes  and a return on its investment 
on december   the ferc issued an order accepting a proposed amendment to the parents power supply agreement for the company effective january  this amendment sets the generation demand for each parent proportional to its ownership in the company 
previously  demand for each parent fluctuated due to customer usage 
the company s rates are set by a formula filed with and previously accepted by the ferc 
the only component that changes is the return on equity roe 
pursuant to a settlement agreement filed with and approved by the ferc  the company s roe is set at for the purpose of calculating billing to affiliates and will continue at that rate unless any affected party seeks a change 
revenues are expected to decrease each year due to a normal continuing reduction in the company s net investment in the bath county station and its connecting transmission facilities upon which the return on investment is determined 
the net investment primarily net plant less deferred income taxes decreases to the extent that provisions for depreciation and deferred income taxes exceed net plant additions 
operating revenues for the year ended december   decreased primarily due to a reduction in net investment 
m allegheny generating company the increase in operating expense in was the net result of increases in federal income taxes and depreciation expense 
the increase was only slightly offset by decreases in operation and maintenance expense  and taxes other than income tax 
the decrease in operating expense was due to the decrease in federal income taxes directly related to the reduction in operating income before taxes 
the decrease in operation and maintenance expense in resulted from decreased licensing fees 
the increase in income taxes in resulted from an increase in income before income taxes and the change in deferred income taxes related to accelerated depreciation 
see note b to the financial statements for information regarding income tax provisions 
the decrease in other income  net  from to resulted from the recording of interest income related to an income tax settlement recorded in the interest on long term debt remained relatively flat in since no new debt was issued 
the decrease in other interest expense for resulted from a decrease in the applicable interest rate for outstanding short term obligations 
short term debt from money pool borrowings increased from million to million at december   with interest rates decreasing from at december   to at december  the average outstanding money pool borrowing in was million with an average interest rate of  compared to average outstanding borrowings of million at an average interest rate of

liquidity and capital requirements as previously reported  the company received authority from the sec to pay common dividends from time to time through december   out of capital to the extent permitted under applicable corporation law and any applicable financing agreements which restrict distributions to shareholders 
due to the nature of being a single asset company with declining capital needs  the company systematically reduces capitalization each year as its asset depreciates 
this has resulted in the payment of dividends in excess of current earnings out of other paid in capital and the reduction of retained earnings to zero 
to meet cash needs for operating expenses  the payment of interest  retirement of debt  and for its construction program  the company has used internally generated funds  external financings  and debt instruments 
the timing and amount of external financings depend primarily upon economic and financial market conditions  the company s cash needs  and capital structure objectives of the company 
the availability and cost of external financings depend upon the financial condition of the companies seeking those funds and market conditions 
m allegheny generating company the company s ability to meet its payment obligations under its indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures will depend on its future operations 
the company s future performance is subject to regulatory  economic  financial  competitive  legislative  and other factors that are beyond its control  as discussed in factors that may affect future results on page the company s future performance could affect its ability to maintain its investment grade credit rating 
to enhance liquidity  the company is a participant in bank lines of credit totaling million with allegheny energy and various affiliates for general corporate purposes and as a backstop to their commercial paper programs 
the company and its affiliates use the internal money pool as a facility to accommodate intercompany short term borrowing needs  to the extent that certain companies have funds available 
the money pool provides funds to approved allegheny energy subsidiaries at the lower of the previous day s federal funds effective interest rate  as quoted by the federal reserve  or the previous day s seven day commercial paper rate  as quoted by the same source  less four basis points

some markets  like california  have experienced interruptions of supply and price volatility  which have been the subject of a significant amount of press coverage  much of which has been critical of the restructuring initiatives 
in some markets  including california  government agencies and other interested parties have made proposals to re regulate areas of these mar kets that have been deregulated  and  in california  legislation has been passed placing a moratorium on the sale of generating facilities by regulated utilities 
proposals to re regulate the wholesale power market have been made at the federal level 
proposals of this sort  and legislative or other attention to the electric power restructuring process in the states in which allegheny energy currently operates  or may in the future operate  may cause deregulation to be delayed  discontinued  or reversed  which could have a material effect on allegheny energy s operations and strategies 
the recent bankruptcy filing by enron corporation enron may affect the regulatory and legislative process 
in response to the enron bankruptcy filing and the september terrorists attacks  financial markets have been disrupted in general  and the availability and cost of capital for allegheny energy s business and that of its competitors has been adversely affected 
following the enron bankruptcy filing  credit ratings agencies reviewed the capital structure and earnings power of energy companies  including allegheny energy 
these events have constrained the capital available to the industry and could adversely affect allegheny energy s access to funding for its operations 
activities at the federal level the terrorists attacks of september   have altered the agenda of the th congress 
in fact  some legislative initiatives have been delayed or postponed since that date because the congress and the bush administration have been focused on responding to these attacks 
however  part of that response may well be the consideration of energy security legislation currently in development 
allegheny energy is lobbying for the inclusion of important electricity restructuring provisions in this legislation  including the repeal or significant revision of puhca  as well as for critical infra structure protection legislation 
prior to the m allegheny generating company attack  two primary bills had been introduced in the us senate s 
 by former energy and natural resources committee chairman senator frank murkowski of alaska  and s 
 by the committee s new chairman  senator jeff bingaman of new mexico 
provisions from these bills could be included in the new energy legislation 
the primary house committee of jurisdiction  energy and commerce  initially passed the president s national energy security proposal and is only now considering accompanying electricity restructuring legislation 
among issues that are being addressed in this legislation are the repeal or significant revision of puhca and section mandatory purchase provisions of the public utility regulatory policies act purpa 
allegheny energy continues to advocate the repeal of puhca and section of purpa on the grounds that they are obsolete and anticompetitive and that purpa results in utility customers paying above market prices for power 
separately  the senate banking committee in april approved s 
 legislation to repeal puhca 
ohio activities the ohio general assembly passed legislation in to restructure its electric utility industry 
as of january   all of the state s electricity customers were able to choose their electricity supplier  beginning a five year transition to market rates 
residential customers are guaranteed a five percent cut in the generation portion of their rate 
monongahela power reached a stipulated agreement with major parties on a transition plan to bring electric choice to its approximately  ohio customers 
none of monongahela power s ohio customers have switched to another supplier 
the restructuring plan allowed monongahela power to transfer its ohio and the ferc jurisdictional generating assets to allegheny energy supply at book value 
that transfer was made on june  west virginia activities electric restructuring in west virginia remains unresolved and awaits further legislative action 
in january  the west virginia psc submitted a restructuring plan to the legislature for approval that would open full retail competition on january  on march   the west virginia legislature approved the west virgina psc s plan  but assigned the tax issues surrounding the plan to a legislative subcommittee for further study 
the start date of competition is contingent upon the necessary tax changes being made and implementation being approved by the legislature 
no final legislative action was taken in regarding the implementation of the deregulation plan 
although the west virginia legislature may reconsider the deregulation plan in the january to march session  the current climate regarding restructuring makes it unlikely that the existing plan will be advanced in m allegheny generating company as approved by the west virginia psc  potomac edison transferred its generating assets to allegheny energy supply in august in accordance with the same restructuring agreement  potomac edison and monongahela power implemented a commercial and industrial rate reduction program on july  the status of electric energy competition in virginia  in which affiliates of the company serve is as follows virginia activities the virginia electric utility restructuring act restructuring act became law on march  all state utilities were required to submit a restructuring plan by january   to be effective on january  on december   the virginia state corporation commission virginia scc approved potomac edison s phase ii of the functional separation plan 
in august  potomac edison transferred its virginia jurisdictional generating assets  excluding its hydroelectric assets located in the state of virginia  to allegheny energy supply at book value 
customer choice was implemented for all customers in potomac edison s service territory beginning on january  the restructuring act was amended during the general assembly legislative session to direct the virginia scc to prepare for legislative approval a plan for competitive metering and billing and to authorize the virginia scc to implement a consumer education program on electric choice  funded through its regulatory tax 
on december   the virginia scc issued a report on competitive metering and billing 
its recommendations include allowing licensed electricity suppliers to provide billing services  with the customer selecting its preferred billing option 
the virginia scc also recommended that legislative action on competitive metering be deferred pending further study  due to the complexities of the issue and limited competitive metering activities nationally 
on may   the virginia scc initiated proceedings to establish rules and regulations for consolidated billing services  competitive metering  and customer minimum stay periods 
various rulemaking proceedings to implement customer choice are ongoing before the virginia scc  including an application by potomac edison to participate in a regional transmission entity 
derivative instruments and hedging activities in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

an amendment of fasb statement no 
 and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
effective january   the company implemented the requirements of these accounting standards 
m allegheny generating company these standards establish accounting and reporting requirements for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
they require that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the standards require that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in earnings or other comprehensive income and requires that a company formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
based on the company s current activities  sfas no 
is not expected to create a significant increase in the volatility of reported earnings and other comprehensive i ncome 
as of december   the company had no financial instruments  commodity contracts  or other commitments that required recognition as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value under the provisions of sfas no 
new accounting standards in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these standards will change the accounting for business combinations and goodwill in two significant ways 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  use of the pooling of interests method will be prohibited 
sfas no 
is not expected to a have a material effect on the company 
sfas no 
changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
for entities with calendar year ends  amortization of goodwill  including goodwill recorded in past business combinations  ceased upon adoption of the standard on january  subsequently  an entity s goodwill will be tested at least annually for impairment 
intangible assets other than goodwill will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment 
as of december   the company had no goodwill 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this standard  which the company will adopt on january   requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability will be accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost will be depreciated over the useful life of the asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either will settle the obligation for its recorded amount or incur a gain or loss upon settlement 
the company will be evaluating the effect of adopting sfas no 
on its results of operations and financial position prior to its adoption of the standard 
m allegheny generating company in october  the fasb issued sfas no

we currently own or have the contractual right to  mw in california  indiana  illinois  maryland  ohio  pennsylvania  tennessee  virginia  and west virginia 
of this capacity   mw was transferred from west penn power company  or west penn  the potomac edison power company  or potomac edison  and monongahela power company  or monongahela power  at net book value 
west penn  potomac edison  and monongahela power are all regulated utility subsidiaries of our parent company  allegheny energy 
it is our goal to complete the transfer of an additional  mw of generating capacity from monongahela power 
our strategy is to expand our generating fleet of  mw by a further  mw through the announced construction and development of new facilities  acquisition of contractual rights to generating capacity  planned expansions to existing facilities  and pending transfers of generating capacity from monongahela power and other allegheny energy subsidiaries 
this additional generating capacity will be located in the states of arizona  indiana  nevada  new york  ohio  pennsylvania  virginia  and west virginia 
we manage all of our generating assets as an integrated portfolio with our risk management  wholesale marketing  fuel procurement  and energy trading activities 
in  our company  then a wholly owned subsidiary of allegheny energy  was formed in order to consolidate allegheny energy s deregulated generating assets into a single company that is not subject to state regulation of sales prices

significant events in   and corporate restructuring in november  we and our parent  allegheny energy  filed applications with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  and the federal energy regulatory commission  or ferc  seeking authorization under the public utility holding company act of  or puhca  and the federal power act to restructure our corporate organization by creating a new maryland holding company into which we will then merge 
we will thereby be changed from a delaware limited liability company into a maryland corporation 
we and our parent  allegheny energy  also sought authorization to merge allegheny energy global markets  llc  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  into us as a part of forming this new maryland holding company  which will then continue to conduct our energy marketing and trading activities as our energy marketing and trading division 
on december   we received ferc and sec approvals to effect this reorganization 
effective december   allegheny energy global markets  llc  was me rged into us  excluding its employees  an operating lease and related leasehold improvements for its new york office  certain computer software and telecommunications equipment  and other miscellaneous assets  which were transferred to allegheny energy service corporation  a subsidiary of our parent  allegheny energy 
we will be merged into the yet to be formed maryland holding company in on july   we  together with allegheny energy and other affiliates  filed a u application with the sec  seeking authorization under the puhca to effect an initial public offering of up to of the common stock of the yet to be formed maryland holding company  which would own of us  and then distribute the remaining common stock owned by allegheny energy to its shareholders on a tax free basis 
in october  allegheny energy and we announced that the proposed initial public offering would be delayed due to market and other conditions 
on january   allegheny energy and we announced that the initial public offering would not be pursued 
on february   allegheny energy and we filed an amendment to the u application of july   with the sec  withdrawing our initial public offering application 
transfer and acquisition of generating assets and generating capacity since formation transfer of generating assets in at december   we had generating capacity of  mw 
this included the negotiated transfer by west penn of  mw of its deregulated generating capacity at a net book value of million in the fourth quarter of  the transfer of west penn s entitlement to mw in the ohio valley electric corporation  and the purchase of mw of capacity at fort martin unit no 
from ayp energy  inc  a subsidiary of allegheny energy 
the  mw transferred included west penn s ownership interest in allegheny generating company  or agc 
agc s only asset is a interest  representing mw  in the bath county pumped storage hydroelectric station and its connecting transmission facilities 
during the period from november   through january   we leased back to west penn one third  or  mw  of the generating assets it had transferred to us 
the generating capacity of  mw is not included in the  mw at december  m allegheny energy supply company  llc and subsidiaries transfer of generating assets in during  we increased our generating capacity by  mw to  mw 
the increase in generating capacity included  among other things  the negotiated transfer by potomac edison of approximately  mw of its maryland  virginia  and west virginia jurisdictional generating assets at a net book value of million in august and the transfer of potomac edison s entitlement to mw in the ohio valley electric corporation 
the  mw transferred included potomac edison s ownership interest in agc 
the increase of  mw during also includes  mw that was released to us as a result of the expiration of the lease with west penn on january  transfer and acquisition of generating assets and generating capacity in during  we increased our ownership and contractual right to control generating capacity by  mw to  mw 
the increase in generating capacity in included in december  we completed construction of and placed into service two mw simple cycle natural gas combustion turbines near chambersburg  pennsylvania  in june  the negotiated transfer by monongahela power of approximately mw of its ohio and ferc jurisdictional generating assets at a net book value of million 
the mw transferred included the ohio part of monongahela power s ownership interest in agc  in june  the transfer by allegheny energy of mw of generating capacity in the conemaugh generating station 
allegheny energy purchased this capacity from potomac electric power company in january at a cost of approximately million 
the mw represents approximately a ownership interest in the  mw conemaugh generating station located in west central pennsylvania  in june  the transfer by allegheny energy of two mw simple cycle natural gas combustion turbines in springdale  pennsylvania by merging its subsidiary  allegheny energy units no 
 llc  with us  in may  the acquisition of three natural gas fired generating facilities totaling  mw of peaking capacity from enron north america corporation 
we refer to these assets as the midwest assets 
all three facilities had been in service with their former owner since june they include the mw lincoln energy center plant in manhattan  illinois  the mw wheatland plant in wheatland  indiana  and the mw gleason plant in gleason  tennessee 
the billion purchase price was financed with short term debt of million from a group of credit providers  a million parent loan  a million parent equity contribution  and other short term debt  in february and june  the expansion through improvements of generating capacity of two plants by mw  and in march  the acquisition of the contractual right to call up to  mw in connection with the acquisition from merrill lynch capital services  inc  or merrill lynch  described below 
acquisition of the energy marketing and trading business in march  we acquired global energy markets  the energy marketing and trading business of merrill lynch  which now operates as our energy marketing and trading division 
this division helps us optimize our portfolio of generating assets by significantly enhancing our risk management  wholesale marketing  fuel procurement  and energy trading activities on a nationwide basis 
it has also expanded our expertise in risk management  market analysis  fuel procurement  and nationwide trading 
this division therefore provides us with valuable market intelligence to help us better identify opportunities to expand our acquisition and development activities and to compete outside our traditional regions 
the acquisition included a long term contractual right through may to call up to  mw of generating capacity in southern california  which represents of the total available capacity of three generating facilities 
as part of the energy trading portfolio we acquired  the  m allegheny energy supply company  llc and subsidiaries mw contract was recorded at its fair value in our accounting for the purchase of this business 
see note d to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this acquisition 
announced construction and development plans and asset transfers since january  we have announced construction and development plans  pending transfers  and contractual rights to control an additional  mw of generating capacity 
this additional capacity will be phased in as it becomes available 
construction and development plans additional generating capacity through announced construction and development plans includes construction of a  mw base load natural gas fired generating facility in la paz county  arizona  approximately miles west of phoenix 
we expect construction to begin on the combined cycle facility in and be completed by  construction of a mw intermediate load and peaking natural gas fired facility in st 
joseph county  indiana 
a combined cycle facility with mw of capacity will be completed in two mw simple cycle combustion turbines will be constructed as market conditions warrant  construction of a mw combined cycle generating plant in springdale  pennsylvania 
the new facility will include two natural gas fired combustion turbines and a steam turbine 
we expect this facility to be operational in a joint project with consol energy  inc to construct an mw natural gas fired generating facility in buchanan county in southwest virginia of which we will own mw of generating capacity 
the facility is expected to be in operation by mid  and an additional mw of generating capacity from expansion of existing plants 
contractual control of capacity in may  we signed a year agreement with las vegas cogeneration ii  llc 
this agreement gives us the contractual right to control mw of generating capacity in a natural gas fired  combined cycle generating facility  currently under construction by a third party  in las vegas  nevada  beginning in the third quarter of we record this agreement at its fair value on the consolidated balance sheet  with changes in fair value recorded as a component of wholesale revenues on the consolidated statement of operations 
in november  we announced plans to develop a mw barge mounted  natural gas fired combustion turbine generating facility to be located in the brooklyn navy yard  new york 
additional asset transfers additional generating capacity through further asset transfers includes transfer of the remaining  mw from monongahela power if tax changes related to the deregulation of the retail power market in west virginia are passed by the west virginia legislature or the west virginia public service commission takes regulatory action 
for a discussion of developments in west virginia relating to this transfer  see developments in west virginia relating to the generating asset transfer from monongahela power  and transfer of an additional mw of generating capacity  including mw from the hunlock creek generating station near wilkes barre  pennsylvania 
we have sought approval from the sec to transfer this generating capacity 
we anticipate that the transfer will be completed during m allegheny energy supply company  llc and subsidiaries power sales agreements for the provider of last resort obligations of allegheny energy s utility subsidiaries under the terms of the deregulation plans approved in pennsylvania for west penn  in maryland for potomac edison  and in ohio for monongahela power  west penn  potomac edison  and monongahela power are obligated to provide electricity during a transition period to all customers who do not choose an alternate supplier of electricity and to customers that switch back from alternate suppliers 
for west penn  the pennsylvania transition period continues through december   for all customers with escalating capped rates 
for residential customers of potomac edison in maryland  the transition period continues through december  for commercial and industrial customers of potomac edison in maryland  the transition period continues through december  for monongahela power  the transition period for ohio residential and small commercial customers continues through december   and for all other ohio customers through december  pursuant to long term power sales agreements that are approved by the ferc  we provide west penn  potomac edison  and monongahela power with the amount of electricity  up to their provider of last resort retail load  that they may demand during the pennsylvania  maryland  and ohio transition periods 
we expect to provide power pursuant to similar obligations to potomac edison and monongahela power in west virginia if this state implements customer choice 
we recently renegotiated a power sales agreement with potomac edison with respect to its virginia customers under which we have agreed to provide it with the amount of electricity up to its provider of last resort retail load that it may demand 
the default service obligation for potomac edison in virginia may be eliminated after july   if the virginia state corporation commission determines there is sufficient competition 
in any event  after termination of capped rates  the rates for default service will be based upon competitive market pric es for generation services 
a significant portion of the normal operating capacity of our fleet of transferred generating assets is currently required to fulfill our obligations under these power sales agreements  but we expect that this will decrease over time 
as a result  these power sales agreements will provide us with a steady revenue stream during the transition periods discussed above 
these agreements do not  however  provide us with any guaranteed level of customer sales and also mean that we are limited in our ability to pass on to the regulated utility subsidiaries of allegheny energy the risk of fuel price increases and increased costs of environmental compliance 
our power sales agreements with west penn  monongahela power with respect to its ohio customers  and potomac edison with respect to its maryland and virginia customers  to provide them with an amount of electricity up to their provider of last resort retail load  have a fixed price as well as a market based pricing component 
as the amount of generating capacity we must deliver under these agreements decreases during the transition periods described above  the amount of electricity that is subject to market prices escalates each year 
we expect that when the transition periods end  west penn  potomac edison  and monongahela power with respect to its ohio customers will pay us market rates for the entire amount of electricity provided to them 
we cannot terminate the power sales agreements with west penn  monongahela power  and potomac edison unless there is a completed hostile takeover of allegheny energy 
until customer choice is implemented in west virginia and a power sales agreement is entered into  the assets transferred to us by potomac edison will continue to serve the retail load for west virginia customers of potomac edison 
we lease back to potomac edison the west virginia jurisdictional portion of its generating assets that were transferred to us based on operating costs of those facilities  including a return on investment 
other related party transactions under the deregulation plan approved by the pennsylvania public utility commission for west penn  west penn is authorized to collect from its customers competitive transition charge  or ctc  revenue to recover transition costs  including certain costs of generating assets 
since west penn s generating assets were transferred to us in november  the related ctc revenue has also been transferred to us since november during   and  we recorded million  million  and million  respectively  of ctc revenue transferred to us by west penn 
in november  we entered into an agreement with potomac edison to purchase mw of unit contingent capacity  energy  and ancillary services from january   through december  the cost of the energy to be acquired from potomac edison will depend upon the megawatt hours actually delivered under the agreement 
we were awarded this contract as a result of a competitive bidding process 
on november   the maryland m allegheny energy supply company  llc and subsidiaries public service commission approved the power sales agreement and the ferc has accepted the agreement for filing 
other than officers and employees of allegheny energy supply lincoln generating facility  llc  allegheny energy services corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of allegheny energy  employs all of our personnel 
allegheny energy services corporation performs services at cost for us and our affiliates  in accordance with the puhca 
through allegheny energy service corporation  we are responsible for our share of the cost of services provided by them 
the cost of services billed to us during   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
on december   allegheny energy global markets  llc  was merged into us  excluding its employees  an operating lease and related leasehold improvements for its new york office  certain computer software and telecommunications equipment  and other miscellaneous assets  which were transferred to allegheny energy service corporation 
the net book value of the assets and liabilities transferred to allegheny energy service corporation was million 
the sec  under puhca  and the ferc  under the federal power act  approved this restructuring 
in conjunction with the transfer of monongahela power s ohio and ferc jurisdictional generating assets  we assumed million of pollution control debt 
monongahela power continues to be a co obligor with respect to the million of pollution control debt 
we jointly own certain generating assets with monongahela power as tenants in common 
we operate these jointly owned generating facilities with each owner being entitled to the available energy output and capacity in proportion to its ownership in the assets 
each owner pays its proportionate share of the operating costs 
power sales agreements our acquisition of merrill lynch s energy marketing and trading business included the long term contractual right to call up to  mw of natural gas fired generating capacity in southern california and related hedges 
in connection with this business acquisition  we evaluated the long term and short term risks associated with this portfolio in order to construct a prudent risk mitigation strategy 
we concluded that the most significant risk was the changing relationship between the electricity and natural gas prices over time and the resulting effects on the value of our contractual right to call up to  mw of generating capacity 
in the short term  unusually high prices and volatility in the electricity and natural gas markets were expected to continue 
given the prevailing levels of volatility in the electricity and natural gas markets and our contractual right to call up to  mw of generating capacity  we implemented a hedging strategy 
accordingly  in march  we closed a substantial p art of our long position by entering into a power sales agreement with the california department of water resources  or cdwr  the electricity buyer for the state of california 
the agreement is for a period through december under this agreement  we have committed to supply california with contract volumes varying from mw to mw through december for the last seven years of the contract  the contract volume will be fixed at  mw 
the contract contains a fixed price of per megawatt hour 
we remained concerned about the forward cost of natural gas and spot prices for electricity in california and the net position of the contractual right to call up to  mw of generating capacity 
consequently  we entered into a series of forward purchases of electricity through designed to hedge these risks 
while these forward purchases were made at then market prices  the prices paid for these forward purchases exceeded the contractual price of the cdwr agreement 
as a result  the cdwr agreement and related forward purchase hedges have negatively affected our cash flows since march while this hedging strategy will result in short term cash outflows through  the total projected cash flows remain significantly positive 
this hedging strategy is performing as designed 
in august  we were the successful bidder to supply baltimore gas electric company with electricity from july through june we are committed to supply baltimore gas electric company with an amount needed to fulfill of its provider of last resort obligations 
this amount is estimated to range from mw to mw 
m allegheny energy supply company  llc and subsidiaries in july  we were named the electric generation supplier for eight boroughs in new jersey that own and operate electric utilities as departments of municipal governments 
the multi year contracts will begin in june the contracts  which will supply a total of mw of electricity to the boroughs  will run through we record all of the above contracts at their fair value on the consolidated balance sheet  with changes in fair value recorded as a component of wholesale revenues on the consolidated statement of operations 
for additional information regarding these agreements see review of operations critical accounting policies and estimates  and operating revenues  and note e to the consolidated financial statements 
developments in west virginia relating to the generating asset transfer from monongahela power in march  the west virginia legislature passed house resolution approving  with some modifications  an electric deregulation plan submitted by the west virginia public service commission 
the plan provides for all customers to have choice of an electric generation supplier and allows monongahela power to transfer the west virginia portion  approximately  mw  of its generating assets to us 
under house resolution  the west virginia deregulation plan cannot occur until the west virginia legislature enacts certain tax changes regarding the preservation of tax revenues for state and local governments 
no final legislative action was taken in regarding implementation of the deregulation plan 
although the west virginia legislature may reconsider the deregulation plan in the january to march session  the current climate regarding restructuring makes it unlikely that the existing plan will be advanced in as a result  monongahela power has to date not been able to transfer its west virginia jurisdictional generating assets to us 
we are exploring other ways to complete the transfer to us of monongahela power s west virginia jurisdictional generating assets 
the june order by the west virginia public service commission permits monongahela power to submit a petition to the west virginia public service commission seeking approval to transfer its west virginia generating assets prior to the implementation of the deregulation plan 
in august  with a supplemental filing in october  monongahela power filed a petition seeking west virginia public service commission approval of that transfer 
the west virginia public service commission has not yet acted on the request 
settlement discussions regarding the generating asset transfer are ongoing 
proposed natural gas storage and pipeline project on january   we announced our participation in an open season process for a proposed natural gas storage and pipeline project the desert crossing gas storage and transportation system which would be located in nevada and arizona 
sponsored by the salt river project  sempra energy resources  and us  the proposed project would include the development of a billion cubic foot salt cavern storage complex  north of kingman  arizona  and an associated north south pipeline  extending approximately miles from near las vegas  nevada  to wenden  in southwest arizona 
if constructed  the natural gas storage and pipeline could provide a high deliverability natural gas storage facility and interconnections with major natural gas pipelines in the southwest region of the united states 
it could be a stable source of natural gas supply for our proposed  mw la paz generating facility and could provide supplies and more options for existing tolling agreements we have in las vegas and in parts of cali fornia 
the open season when prospective natural gas shippers may bid for capacity on the project was held from january   through february  in response to the open season  a number of bids were received from potential shippers  reflecting support for the project by the market 
however  many of the bid submissions were not binding due to the inclusion of contingency clauses 
in addition  the recent announcement of the cancellation or delay of several development projects for new generating facilities has caused many shippers to express concern over the commitment to a binding bid 
discussions are ongoing with interested parties to determine their level of commitment 
a final decision regarding whether to move forward with the project will be made at the conclusion of those discussions 
utility workers union of america contract negotiations on april   allegheny energy s collective bargaining agreement with the utility workers union of america system local  or uwua  expired 
the parties entered into a contract extension through may  allegheny energy was unable to reach agreement with the uwua on a new labor pact by this deadline 
the parties continue to work under the terms and conditions of the prior labor agreement on a day to day basis 
the uwua and m allegheny energy supply company  llc and subsidiaries allegheny energy have continued to meet from time to time in pursuit of a long term agreement 
the prior agreement covers approximately of allegheny energy s employees that directly support our operations 
review of operations critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies during the reporting period 
the estimates that require management s most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments involve the fair value of commodity contracts and goodwill 
commodity contracts 
commodity contracts related to our energy trading activities are recorded at their fair value in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for energy trading and risk management activities 
at december   the fair value of our commodity contracts was a net asset position of million 
the fair value of exchange traded instruments  primarily futures and certain options  was based on actively quoted market prices 
in establishing the fair value of commodity contracts that do not have quoted prices  such as physical forward contracts  over the counter options  and swaps management uses available market data and pricing models to estimate fair values 
estimating fair values of instruments which do not have quoted market prices requires management judgment in determining amounts which could reasonably be expected to be received from  or paid  to  a third party in settlement of the contracts 
the amounts could be materially diff erent from the amounts that might be realized in an actual sale transaction 
fair values are subject to change in the near term and reflect management s best estimate based on various factors 
in establishing the fair value of commodity contracts  we make estimates using available market data and pricing models 
factors such as uncertainty in prices  operational risks related to generating facilities  and risks related to the performance by counterparties are evaluated in establishing the fair value of these contracts 
our accounting for commodity contracts is discussed under operating revenues starting on page xx and note e to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the above  the fair value of our commodity contracts can be affected by regulatory challenges involving deregulation of energy prices and markets 
the california public utilities commission  or california puc  has filed a complaint with the ferc to abrogate or substantially modify the contracts between the cdwr and us  which could have a material effect on the fair value of our commodity contracts

a new accounting standard  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets required that the amortization of goodwill cease beginning in instead  goodwill is required to be tested at least annually for impairment using the fair value of the business 
for us  the estimation of the fair value of the business will involve use of present value measurements and cash flow models 
we are in the process of determining the affects of sfas no 
on our financial position and results of operations 
earnings summary because of the high levels of acquisition and transfer activity described above since our formation  it may be difficult to evaluate the probable impact of these acquisitions and generating asset transfers on our financial performance or make meaningful comparisons between reporting periods until we have operating results for a number of reporting periods from these facilities and assets 
it may  therefore  not be possible to draw meaningful comparisons and conclusions from the year to year comparisons discussed in review of operations and financial condition  requirements  and resources  because of the significant impact on our consolidated financial statements of added generating capacity  especially the acquisition of the midwest assets in the second quarter of  the acquisition of merrill lynch s energy marketing and trading business in the first quarter of  and the transfer of generating assets from potomac edison in the third quarter of for the year ended december   we increased our ownership of and contractual right to generating capacity to  mw from  mw owned or under contractual control as of december  similarly  for the year ended december   we had increased our ownership of and contractual right to control generating capacity to  mw from  mw owned or under contractual control as of december  m allegheny energy supply company  llc and subsidiaries consolidated net income for   and for the period  or from our inception on november   to december   was as follows year ended december  year ended december  from november  inception date to december  thousands of dollars consolidated income before income taxes  minority interest  and cumulative effect of accounting change federal and state income taxes minority interest consolidated income before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change  net note f to the consolidated financial statements consolidated net income the increase in consolidated net income for reflects the growth in generating capacity through transfers from the regulated utility subsidiaries and other subsidiaries of allegheny energy  acquisition and construction of additional generating assets  and the results of the energy trading activities 
on march   we acquired merrill lynch s energy marketing and trading business 
this acquisition helps us optimize our portfolio of generating assets by significantly enhancing our risk management  wholesale marketing  fuel procurement  and energy trading activities 
we consider this business to be an integral part of our energy supply business and key to our strategy of becoming a national energy company 
this business markets and trades electricity  natural gas  oil  and other energy commodities using primarily over the counter contracts and exchange traded contracts  such as those traded on the new york mercantile exchange  or nymex 
the unrealized and realized gains from energy trading activities are discussed below under operating revenues wholesale 
see note d to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this acquisition 
we had certain option contracts that met the derivative criteria in sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which did not qualify for hedge accounting 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recorded a charge of million against earnings net of the related tax effect million before tax for these contracts as a change in accounting principle on january  see note f to our consolidated financial statements for additional details

we continue to be active in the retail markets as an alternative generation supplier in states where retail competition has been implemented 
the reduction in retail revenues for was primarily due to our shift in focus away from retail customers toward wholesale markets and energy commodity trading 
wholesale 
the increase in wholesale revenues for and was primarily due to the results of energy trading activities 
we have significantly increased the volume and scope of our energy commodity marketing and trading activities 
we record contracts entered into in connection with energy trading at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet  with all changes in fair value recorded as gains and losses on the consolidated statement of operations in wholesale revenues  consistent with our accounting policy described in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
the realized revenues from energy trading activities  with the exception of certain financial instruments  including swaps and certain options  are recorded on a gross basis as individual discrete transactions as either revenues or expenses because the contracts require physical delivery of the underlying asset 
fair values for exchanged traded instruments  principally futures and certain options  are based on active ly quoted market prices 
in establishing the fair value of commodity contracts that do not have quoted market prices  such as physical contracts  over the counter options and swaps  management makes estimates using available market data and pricing models 
we have certain contracts that are unique  which extend to and beyond  and are valued using proprietary pricing models 
inputs to the models include estimated forward natural gas and power prices  interest rates  estimates of market volatility for natural gas and power prices  the correlation of natural gas and power prices  and other factors such as generating unit availability and location  as appropriate 
these inputs require management judgments and assumptions 
our models also adjust the fair value of commodity contracts to reflect uncertainty in prices  operational risks related to generating facilities  and risks related to the performance of counterparties 
these inputs become more challenging and the models become less precise the furt her into the future these estimates are made 
actual effects on our financial position and results of operations may vary significantly from expected results  if the judgments and assumptions underlying those models prove to be wrong or the models prove to be unreliable 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk for additional information regarding our exposure to market risks associated with commodity prices 
the fair value of energy trading commodity contracts  which represent the net unrealized gain and loss positions  are recorded as assets and liabilities as stated above  after applying the appropriate counterparty netting agreements in accordance with the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no

the following table disaggregates the net fair value of commodity contract assets and liabilities  excluding our generating assets and power sales agreements for allegheny energy s regulated utility subsidiaries for their provider of last resort obligations  as of december   based on the underlying market price source and contract delivery periods m allegheny energy supply company  llc and subsidiaries fair value of contracts at december  delivery less than year delivery years delivery years delivery in excess of years total fair value millions of dollars prices actively quoted prices provided by other external sources prices based on models total in the table above  each commodity contract is classified by source of fair value based on the entire contract being assigned to a single classification even though a portion of a contract may be able to be valued based on one of the other classifications and the fair values are shown for the scheduled delivery or settlement dates 
we determine prices actively quoted from various industry services  broker quotes  and the nymex 
electricity markets are generally liquid for approximately three years and natural gas markets are generally liquid for approximately five years 
afterwards  some market prices can be observed  but market liquidity is less robust 
approximately billion of our commodity contracts are classified as prices based on models even though a portion of these contracts are valued based on observable market prices 
the most significant variable to our models used to value these contracts is the forward prices for both electricity and natural gas 
these forward prices are based on observable market prices to the extent prices are available in the market 
generally  electricity forward prices are actively quoted for about three years and some observable market prices are available for five years 
after five years  the forward prices for electricity are based on the forward price for natural gas and a marginal heat rate for generation based on more efficient natural gas fired generation to convert natural gas into electricity 
for natural gas  forward prices are generally actively quoted for about five years and some observable market prices are available for about ten years 
beyond ten years  natural gas prices are escalated base d on trends in prior years 
for deliveries less than one year  the fair value of our commodity contracts was a net liability of million  primarily related to commodity contracts to hedge the cdwr agreement 
as discussed below  we expect to incur realized losses related to the contract with the cdwr and related hedges through net unrealized gains  before tax  of million in and million in were recorded to the consolidated statement of operations in wholesale revenues to reflect the change in fair value of energy commodity contracts 
the following table provides a roll forward of the net fair value  or commodity contract assets less commodity contract liabilities  of our commodity contracts from december   to december  amount millions of dollars net fair value of commodity contract assets and liabilities at december  net fair value of commodity contracts acquired from merrill lynch s energy marketing and trading business subtotal adoption of sfas no 
fair value of structured transactions when entered during net options paid and received unrealized gains on commodity contracts  net net fair value of commodity contract assets and liabilities at december  the sum of these items are the components of the net unrealized gains of million 
during  we did not have any changes in the fair value of commodity contracts attributed to changes in valuation techniques 
with regard to the assumptions  we frequently evaluate availability  correlation  volatility  heat rate  and other factors against market observations and market adjustments 
the effects of these changes cannot be readily separated from the impacts of changes in forward prices for electricity and natural gas 
m allegheny energy supply company  llc and subsidiaries as shown in the table above  the fair value of our commodity contracts increased by million as a result of unrealized gains recorded during of the unrealized gains  million related to our contracts in the western systems coordinating council  or the wscc  including the fixed price contract with the cdwr and the contract to call up to  mw of generating capacity in southern california 
this increase in the fair value of the wscc portfolio was driven by the fixed price contract to sell power for approximately years to the cdwr  which increased in fair value as prices dropped in the wscc during the increase in fair value of the cdwr contract was partly offset by decreases in the fair value of the contract to call up to  mw of generating capacity in southern california and other contracts primarily used to hedge the wscc portfolio 
during  our energy trading activities resulted in million of net realized losses 
these losses were mainly related to our contract with the cdwr and the related hedges  which were partially offset by realized gains from the sale of generation from the generating assets acquired in the midwest and from generation in excess of the power provided to allegheny energy s regulated utility subsidiaries to meet their provider of last resort obligations 
due to the existing hedges of the cdwr contract  we are currently paying for power at prices above the fixed price contract to sell power to the cdwr for the reasons discussed under power sales agreements 
we expect to continue to incur realized losses related to the cdwr contract due to the hedges through  but at a reduced level as the hedges mature 
starting with  we expect to realize gains related to the cdwr contract for the remainder of the term of the contract 
there has been and may continue to be significant volatility in the market prices for electricity and natural gas at the wholesale level  which will affect our operating results 
similarly  volatility in interest rates will affect our operating results 
the effects may be either positive or negative  depending on whether we are a net buyer or seller of electricity and natural gas 
the increase in wholesale revenues for and also reflects increased transactions in the unregulated marketplace to sell electricity to wholesale customers and is also due to having increased generation available for sale 
during the fourth quarter of  west penn transferred its deregulated generating capacity  which totaled  mw  to us at net book value 
in august  potomac edison transferred  mw of its generating assets to us 
in june  monongahela power transferred mw of its ohio and ferc jurisdictional generating assets to us 
on may   we also completed the acquisition of three natural gas fired power plants with a total generating capacity of  mw in illinois  indiana  and tennessee 
as a result  we had more generation available for sale into the deregulated marketplace in and and had concluded more commitments to sell generation in that marketplace 
affiliated 
affiliated revenues are revenues that we obtained from allegheny energy s regulated utility subsidiaries under power sales agreements and a generating asset lease 
in maryland  ohio  pennsylvania  and virginia  we are obligated under power sales agreements to supply the regulated utility subsidiaries of allegheny energy west penn  monongahela power  and potomac edison with power 
under these agreements  we are obligated to provide these companies with the amount of electricity  up to their provider of last resort retail load  that they may demand 
we expect to provide power pursuant to similar obligations to potomac edison and monongahela power in west virginia if this state implements customer choice

we are limited in our ability to pass on to customers the risk of fuel price increases and increased costs of environmental compliance under our power sales agreements with allegheny energy s regulated utility subsidiaries 
m allegheny energy supply company  llc and subsidiaries the increase in fuel expenses for and was primarily associated with the transfer of  mw of potomac edison s generating assets to us in august and  mw that was released to us as a result of the expiration of the lease with west penn on january  the increase in fuel expenses for also reflects the transfer to us in june of mw of monongahela power s ohio and ferc jurisdictional generating assets and the purchase on may   of the midwest assets 
purchased energy and transmission 
purchased energy and transmission increased billion for primarily related to the wholesale marketing and energy commodity trading activities and power purchased to fulfill our power sales agreement obligations to west penn  potomac edison  and monongahela power 
purchased energy and transmission costs increased billion for primarily due to increased buy sell transactions in the fourth quarter of  power purchased to fulfill our power sales agreement obligations to west penn and potomac edison  and unplanned first quarter generating plant outages which caused us to make purchases of higher priced power on the wholesale market 
the increases in purchased energy and transmission costs for were also due to increased purchasing of transmission of electricity for delivery of energy to customers 
other operating expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased by million for primarily due to salary and benefit expenses related to the acquired energy trading business  expenses related to the issuance of short term debt  and rent expense for our offices in new york city and monroeville  pennsylvania

maintenance expenses increased by million and million for and  respectively 
maintenance expenses represent costs incurred to maintain the power stations and general plant and reflect routine maintenance of equipment as well as planned repairs and unplanned expenditures primarily from forced outages at the power stations 
variations in maintenance expense result primarily from unplanned events and planned projects  which vary in timing and magnitude depending upon the length of time equipment has been in service without an overhaul and the amount of work found necessary when the equipment is inspected 
our increase in maintenance expenses for and was primarily due to increased power station maintenance expenses related to the generating assets transferred to us by allegheny energy s regulated utility subsidiaries

at december   we recorded million and million as short term and long term debt  respectively  based on the project cost funding requirements  which are subject to change 
the loan is required to be repaid if the lease balance or maximum recourse amount becomes payable under the lease 
in november  we entered into an operating lease transaction relating to the construction of a mw combined cycle generating facility located in springdale  pennsylvania 
this transaction was structured to finance the construction of the facility with a maximum commitment amount of million 
upon completion of the facility  a special purpose entity will lease the facility to us 
lease payments  to be recorded as rent expense  are estimated at million per month  commencing during the second half of through november subsequently  we have the right to negotiate a renewal of the lease 
if we are unable to renew the lease in november  we must either purchase the facility for the lessor s investment  or sell the facility and pay the difference between the proceeds and the lessor s investment up to a maximum recourse amount of approximately million 
based on costs incurred on the project through december   our maximum recourse obligation was approximately mil lion  reflecting a lessor investment of million 
these operating lease transactions contain covenants  including maximum debt to capitalization ratios  which require compliance in order to avoid defaults and acceleration of payments 
an event of default could require us to pay of the lessor s investment 
the lease transactions for the st 
joseph and springdale facilities are classified as operating leases  which are off balance sheet  as of december   in accordance with gaap 
however  a change in the accounting standards applicable to leases could result in the consolidation of the related special purpose entities  with debt issued by the special purpose entities included in our debt 
as of december   the effect of consolidating these special purpose entities would be to increase our debt by million 
energy marketing and trading business acquisition the purchase agreement for merrill lynch s energy marketing and trading business provides that allegheny energy shall use its best efforts to contribute to us the generating capacity from monongahela power s west virginia jurisdictional generating assets by september  if  after using its best efforts to comply with this provision of the purchase agreement  allegheny energy is prohibited by law from contributing to us those generating assets or substantially all of the economic benefits associated with such assets  then merrill lynch shall have the right to require allegheny energy to repurchase all  but not less than all  of merrill lynch s equity interest in us for million plus interest calculated from march  the purchase agreement also provides that  if allegheny energy has not completed an initial public offering involving us within two years of march   merrill lynch has the right to sell its equity membership interest in us to allegheny energy for million plus interest from march  significant continuing issues electric energy competition the electricity supply segment of the energy industry in the united states is becoming increasingly competitive 
the national energy policy act of led to market based regulation of the wholesale exchange of power within the electric industry by permitting the ferc to compel electric utilities to allow third parties to sell electricity to wholesale customers over their transmission systems 
we continue to be an advocate of federal legislation to remove artificial barriers to competition in electricity markets  avoid regional dislocations  and ensure level playing fields 
m allegheny energy supply company  llc and subsidiaries in addition to the wholesale electricity market becoming more competitive  the majority of states have taken active steps towards allowing retail customers the right to choose their electricity supplier 
our parent  allegheny energy  is at the forefront of state implemented retail competition  having negotiated settlement agreements in all of the states monongahela power  potomac edison  and west penn serve 
pennsylvania  maryland  virginia  and ohio have retail choice programs in place 
west virginia s legislature has approved a deregulation plan  pending additional legislation regarding tax revenues for state and local governments 
no final legislative action was taken in regarding implementation of the deregulation plan 
although the west virginia legislature may reconsider the deregulation plan in the january to march sessions  the current climate regarding restructuring makes it unlikely that the existing plan will be advanced in the regulatory environment applicable to our generation business will continue to undergo substantial changes  on both the federal and state level 
these changes have significantly affected the nature of the electric industry and the manner in which its participants conduct their business 
moreover  existing statutes and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted  new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities  and future changes in laws and regulations may have an effect on us in ways that we cannot predict 
some markets  such as in california  have recently experienced interruptions of supply and price volatility  which have been the subject of a significant amount of press coverage  much of which has been critical of the restructuring initiatives 
in some of these markets  including california  government agencies and other interested parties have made proposals to re regulate areas of these markets that have previously been deregulated  and  in california  le gislation has been passed placing a moratorium on the sale of generating facilities by regulated utilities 
proposals to re regulate the wholesale power market also have been made at the federal level 
proposals of this sort  and legislative or other attention to the electric power restructuring process in the states in which we currently  or may in the future  operate  may cause this process to be delayed  discontinued  or reversed  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or our strategies 
in response to the occurrence of several recent events  including the bankruptcy of enron corporation  the september   terrorists attacks on the united states  and the ongoing war against terrorism by the united states  the financial markets have been disrupted in general  and the availability and cost of capital for our business and that of our competitors has been adversely affected 
in addition  following the bankruptcy of enron corporation  the credit rating agencies initiated a thorough review of the capital structure and earnings power of energy companies  including us 
these events could constrain the capital available to our industry and could adversely affect our access to funding for our operations  the demand for and pricing of our products  and the financial stability of our customers and counterparties in transactions 
activities at the federal level the terrorists attacks of september   have altered the agenda of the th congress 
in fact  some legislative initiatives have been delayed or postponed since that date because the congress and the bush administration have been focused on responding to these attacks 
however  part of that response may well be the consideration of energy security legislation currently in development 
allegheny energy and we are lobbying for the inclusion of important electricity restructuring provisions in this legislation  including the repeal or significant revision of puhca  as well as for critical infrastructure protection legislation 
prior to the attack  two primary bills had been introduced in the us senate s 
 by former energy and natural resources committee chairman senator frank murkowski of alaska  and s 
 by the committee s new chairman  senator jeff bingaman of new mexico 
provisions from these bills could be included in the new energy legislation 
the primary house committee of jurisdiction  energy and commerce  initially passed the president s national energy security proposal and is only now considering accompanying electricity restructuring legislation 
among issues that are being addressed in this legislation are the repeal or significant revision of puhca and section mandatory purchase provisions of the public utility regulatory policies act of  or purpa 
we continue to advocate the repeal of puhca and section of purpa on the grounds that they are obsolete and anticompetitive and that purpa results in utility customers paying above market prices for power 
separately  the senate banking committee in april approved s 
 legislation to repeal puhca 
m allegheny energy supply company  llc and subsidiaries ohio activities the ohio general assembly passed legislation in to restructure its electric utility industry 
as of january   all of the state s electricity consumers were able to choose their electricity supplier  beginning a five year transition to market rates 
residential customers are guaranteed a cut in the generation portion of their rate 
monongahela power reached a stipulated agreement with major parties on a transition plan to bring electric choice to its  ohio customers 
the restructuring plan allowed monongahela power to transfer its ohio and ferc jurisdictional generating assets to us at net book value 
that transfer was made effective june  virginia activities the virginia electric utility restructuring act became effective in july the virginia state corporation commission allowed potomac edison to transfer certain utility securities  certain contractual entitlements  and generating assets  excluding certain hydroelectric facilities located in virginia  to a non regulated affiliate at net book value 
in july  the virginia state corporation commission granted approval for the transfer 
in august  potomac edison transferred these virginia generating assets to us at net book value 
west virginia activities electric restructuring in west virginia remains unresolved and awaits further legislative action  largely due to uneasiness among state leaders due to the turmoil experienced in california in and in january  the west virginia public service commission submitted a restructuring plan to the legislature for approval that would open full retail competition on january  on march   the west virginia legislature approved the west virginia public service commission s plan  but assigned the tax issues surrounding the plan to a legislative subcommittee for further study 
the start date of competition is contingent upon the necessary tax changes being made and implementation being approved by the legislature 
no final legislative action was taken in regarding implementation of the deregulation plan 
although the west virginia legislature may reconsider the deregulation plan in the january to march session  the current climate regarding restructuring makes it unlike ly that the existing plan will be advanced in environmental issues the environmental protection agency s  or epa  nitrogen oxides  or no

state implementation plan  or sip  call regulation has been under litigation  and  on march   the district of columbia circuit court of appeals issued a decision that upheld the regulation 
however  state and industry litigants filed an appeal of that decision in april on june   the court denied the request for the appeal 
although the court did issue an order to delay the compliance date from may   until may   both the maryland and pennsylvania state rules to implement the epa nox sip call regulation still require compliance by may  west virginia has issued a proposed rule that would require compliance by may  however  the epa section petition regulation also requires the same level of nox reductions as the epa nox sip call regulation with a may   compliance date 
the epa section petition rule is also under litigati on in the district of columbia circuit court of appeals 
a court decision in may upheld the rule 
in august  the court issued an order that suspends the section petition rule may   compliance date pending epa review of growth factors used to calculate the state nox budgets 
our compliance with such stringent regulations will require the installation of expensive post combustion control technologies on most of our power stations 
our construction forecast includes the expenditure of million of capital costs during and to comply with these regulations 
this amount does not include expenditures relating to the remaining generating assets that we hope to have transferred to us from monongahela power 
on august   allegheny energy received a letter from the epa requiring it to provide certain information on the following electric generating stations albright  armstrong  fort martin  harrison  hatfield s ferry  mitchell  pleasants  rivesville  r 
paul smith  and willow island 
allegheny energy supply and monongahela power now own these electric generating stations 
the letter requested information under section of the federal clean air act to determine compliance with the act and state implementation plan requirements  including potential application of the federal new source review  or nsr 
in general  these standards can require the installation of significant additional air pollution control equipment upon the major modification of an existing facility 
allegheny energy submitted these records in january the eventual outcome of the epa investigation cannot be predicted 
m allegheny energy supply company  llc and subsidiaries similar inquiries have been made of other electric utilities and have resulted in enforcement proceedings being brought in many cases 
we believe our generating facilities have been operating in accordance with the clean air act and the rules implementing the act 
the experience of other utilities  however  suggests that  in recent years  the epa may well have revised its interpretation of the rules regarding the determination of whether an action at a facility constitutes routine maintenance  which would not trigger the requirements of nsr  or a major modification of the facility  which would require compliance with nsr 
if federal nsr were to be applied to these generating stations  in addition to the possible imposition of fines  compliance would entail significant expenditures 
in december  the epa issued a decision to regulate coal and oil fired electric utility mercury emissions under title iii  section of the clean air act amendments 
the epa plans to issue a proposed regulation by december and a final regulation by december the timing and level of required mercury emission reductions are unknown at this time  but could require significant capital expenditures 
other litigation in the normal course of business  we become involved in various legal proceedings 
we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will have a material effect on our financial position

sfas no 
was subsequently amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
an amendment of fasb statement no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
effective january   we implemented the requirements of these accounting standards 
these standards establish accounting and reporting requirements for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
they require that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the statements require that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in earnings or other comprehensive income and requires that a company formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
is expected to increase the volatility in reported earnings and other comprehensive income 
on january   we recorded an asset of million on our consolidated balance sheet based on the fair value of the two cash flow hedge contracts 
an offsetting amount was recorded in other comprehensive income as a change in accounting principle as provided by sfas no 
we had two principal risk management objectives regarding these cash flow hedge contracts 
first  we have a contractual obligation to serve the instantaneous demands of our customers 
when this instantaneous demand exceeds our electric generating capability  we must enter into contracts providing for the purchase of electricity to meet this shortage 
second  the price of electricity is subject to price volatility 
this volatility is the result of many forces  including the weather  and tends to be the highest during the summer months 
to ensure that energy market movements do not cause a significant degradation in earnings  we enter into fixed price electricity purchase contracts 
the amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income related to these contracts were reclassified to earnings during july and august of  when the hedged transactions were executed 
as a result  a loss of million  before tax million net of tax  was reclassified to purchased energy and transmission from other comprehensive income during the third quarter of we also had certain option contracts that met the derivative criteria in sfas no 
 which did not qualify for hedge accounting 
on january   we recorded an asset of 
million and a liability of million on our consolidated balance sheet based on the fair value of these contracts 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recorded a charge of million against earnings net of the related tax effect million before tax for these contracts as a change in accounting principle on january  as of december   these contracts had m allegheny energy supply company  llc and subsidiaries expired  thus reducing their fair value to zero 
the total change in fair value of million for these contracts during was recorded as a gain in wholesale revenues on the consolidated statement of operations 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates 
the commodity price risk exposure results from market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity  natural gas  and other energy related commodities 
the interest rate risk exposure results from changes in interest rates related to interest rate swaps  commercial paper  and variable and fixed rate debt 
we are mandated by allegheny energy s board of directors to engage in a program that systematically identifies  measures  evaluates  and actively manages and reports on market driven risks 
allegheny energy has a corporate energy risk policy adopted by its board of directors and monitored by a risk management committee chaired by its chief executive officer and composed of its senior management 
an allegheny energy risk management group actively measures and monitors the risk exposures to ensure compliance with the policy and it is periodically reviewed 
to manage our financial exposure to commodity price fluctuations in our risk management  wholesale marketing  fuel procurement  and energy trading activities  we routinely enter into contracts  such as electricity and natural gas purchase and sale commitments  to hedge our risk exposure 
however  we do not hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility for a variety of reasons 
to the extent we do not successfully hedge against commodity price volatility  our results of operations and financial position may be affected either favorably or unfavorably by a shift in the future price curves 
also  our energy trading business enters into certain contracts for the sale of electricity produced by our midwest generating assets and our other generating facilities in excess of the power provided to allegheny energy s regulated utility subsidiaries to meet their provider of last resort obligations 
these contracts are recorded at their fair value and are economic hedges for the generating facilities 
for accounting purposes  the generating facilities are recorded at historical cost less depreciation 
as a result  our results of operations and financial position can be favorably or unfavorably affected by a change in future market prices used to value the contracts since there is not an offsetting adjustment to the recorded cost of the generating facilities 
of our commodity driven risks  we are primarily exposed to risks associated with the wholesale marketing of electricity  including the generation  fuel procurement  wholesale marketing  and trading of electricity 
our wholesale activities principally consist of marketing and trading over the counter forward contracts  swaps  and nymex futures contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity and natural gas 
the majority of these contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell electricity and natural gas at fixed prices in the future 
our forward contracts generally require physical delivery of electricity and natural gas 
the swap and nymex futures contracts generally require financial settlement 
we also use option contracts to buy and sell electricity and natural gas at fixed prices in the future 
these option contracts are generally entered into for energy trading and risk management purposes 
the risk management activities focus on management of volume risks supply  operational risks plant outages  and market risks energy prices 
a significant portion of our energy trading activities involves long term structured transactions 
during  we entered into several long term contracts as part of our energy trading activities that may affect our market risk exposure 
uncertainty regarding market conditions and commodity prices increases further into the future 
the following contracts that extend beyond five years were added to our energy trading portfolio during in march  we acquired merrill lynch s energy trading business  including the contractual right to call up to  mw of generation in california through may  in march  we signed a power sales agreement with the cdwr  the electricity buyer for the state of california 
the contract is for a period through december under the terms of the agreement  we have committed to supply california with contract volumes  varying from mw to mw  through december for the last seven years of the contract  the contract volume will be fixed at  mw 
our source for this electricity will be partly through our contractual right to call up to  mw of generation capacity in california  which we acquired as part of the acquisition of merrill lynch s energy trading business  m allegheny energy supply company  llc and subsidiaries in may  we signed a year agreement with las vegas cogeneration ii  llc  for mw of generating capacity  beginning in the third quarter of  and we have long term agreements with el paso natural gas company for the transportation of natural gas starting june   under tariffs approved by the ferc 
these agreements  in part  provide for firm transportation of  thousand cubic feet of natural gas per day through september   from western texas and northern new mexico to the southern california border 
the remainder of the agreements provide for firm transportation of  thousand cubic feet per day through september   from western texas to the southern california border 
credit risk 
credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty to a transaction will be unable to fulfill its contractual obligations 
the credit standing of counterparties is established through the evaluation of the prospective counterparty s financial condition  specified collateral requirements where deemed necessary  and the use of standardized agreements  which facilitate netting of cash flows  associated with a single counterparty 
financial conditions of existing counterparties are monitored on an ongoing basis 
allegheny energy s independent risk management group described above oversees credit risk 
as of december   we had received million of cash collateral from counterparties involved in our energy trading activities 
we are engaged in various trading activities in which counterparties primarily include electric and natural gas utilities  independent power producers  oil and natural gas exploration and production companies  energy marketers  and commercial and industrial end users 
in the event the counterparties do not fulfill their obligations  we may be exposed to credit risk 
the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty or issuer of the instrument 
we have a concentration of customers in the electric and natural gas utility and oil and natural gas exploration and production industries 
these concentrations in customers may affect our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that the customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions 
the following table provides the net fair value of commodity contract asset positions by counterparty credit quality for us at december  credit quality amount millions of dollars investment grade non investment grade no external ratings government agencies other total where a parent company provided a guarantee for a counterparty  we used the parent company s credit rating 
the net fair value of billion  or of our total assets  for no external ratings government agencies mainly relates to our power sales agreement with the cdwr  the department within the state government of california that is responsible for buying electricity for that state 
as of december   the cdwr did not receive a credit rating from an external  independent credit rating agency 
on february   the california public utilities commission issued a rate agreement with the cdwr  in order for the cdwr to issue bonds to repay the state of california s general fund and other outstanding loans 
the agreement would create two streams of revenue for the cdwr by establishing bond charges and power charges on electricity customers 
revenues from power charges will be used to pay the cdwr s operating expenses  including payment of its long term power purchase agreements 
certain  as yet unspecified  operating expenses of the cdwr will be payable from the bo nd charge 
the rate agreement would require the cdwr to use its best efforts to renegotiate our long term power agreements and it does not limit the ability of the california public utility commission or the cdwr to engage in litigation regarding those contracts 
if our agreement was renegotiated or if the cdwr failed for any reason to meet its obligations under this agreement  the value of the agreement as an asset might need to be reduced on our consolidated balance sheet  with a corresponding reduction in net income 
as of december   the cdwr has met all its obligations under this agreement 
on february   the california public utilities commission and the california electricity oversight board filed a complaint with the ferc seeking to abrogate various contracts to which the cdwr is a counterparty  including two m allegheny energy supply company  llc and subsidiaries contracts with us to sell power to the cdwr 
the california public utilities commission alleges that the contracts are unjust and unreasonable due to market dysfunction and the exercise of market power by electricity suppliers during in california 
as a result  the california public utilities commission argues that the cdwr was forced to pay prices that are too high and accept onerous terms and conditions 
in the alternative  the california public utilities commission requests that the ferc reform the challenged contracts to provide just and reasonable pricing  reduce the duration of the contracts  and eliminate certain non price terms 
we believe that our contracts with the cdwr are valid and binding upon the cdwr 
we have responded to the proceeding before the ferc 
at this time  we cannot predict the outcome of the proceedings 
on december   various enron corporation entities  including but not limited to  enron north america corporation and enron power marketing  inc  collectively enron  filed voluntary petitions for chapter reorganization with the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york 
enron and we have master trading agreements in place  which include an international swaps and dealers association agreement  a master power purchase and sale agreement  and a master gas purchase and sale agreement  or agreements 
within all of these agreements there is netting and set off language 
this language allows enron and us to net and set off all amounts owed to each other under the agreements 
we believe that we have appropriately exercised our contractual rights to terminate the agreements and to net out transactions arising within each agreement 
pursuant to the bankruptcy code  we believe that we should be able to offset any termination values or payment amounts owed us against amounts we owe to enron as a result of the netting 
as of november   the fair value of all our trades with enron that were terminated was a net amount of approximately million and we had a net payable to enron of approximately million 
after applying the netting provisions of each agreement  including any collateral posted by enron with us  approximately million was expensed as uncollectible in we continue to evaluate our enron transactions on a daily basis 
market risk 
market risk arises from the potential for changes in the value of energy related to price and volatility in the market 
we reduce these risks by using our generating assets and contractual generation under our control to back positions on physical transactions 
aggregate and counterparty market risk exposure and credit risk limits are monitored within the guidelines of the corporate energy risk control policy 
we evaluate commodity price risk  operational risk  and credit risk in establishing the fair value of commodity contracts 
we use various methods to measure our exposure to market risk  including a value at risk model  or var 
var is a statistical model that attempts to predict risk of loss based on historical market price and volatility data over a given period of time 
the quantification of market risk using var provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products with different risk factors to set the overall corporate risks tolerance  determine risk targets  and position limits 
we calculate var using a variance covariance technique that models option positions using a linear approximation of their value based upon the options delta equivalents 
due to inherent limitations to var  including the use of approximations to value options  subjectivity in the choice of liquidation period  and reliance on historical data to calibrate the model  the var calculation may not accurately reflect our market risk exposure 
as a result  the actual changes in our market risk sensitive instruments could diffe r from the calculated var  and such changes could have a material effect on our financial results 
in addition to var  we routinely perform stress and scenario analyses to measure extreme losses due to exceptional events 
the var and stress test results are reviewed to determine the maximum allowable reduction in the fair value of the energy trading portfolios 
our var calculation includes all contracts  whether financially or physically settled  associated with our wholesale marketing and trading of electricity  natural gas  and other commodities 
we calculate the var  including our generating capacity and the power sales agreements for allegheny energy s regulated utility subsidiaries provider of last resort retail load obligations 
the var calculation does not include positions beyond three years for which there is a limited observable  liquid market 
the var calculation also does not include commodity price exposure related to the procurement of fuel for our generation 
we believe that this represents the most complete calculation of our value at risk 
the var amount represents the potential loss in fair value from the market risk sensitive positions described above over a one day holding period with a confidence level 
as of december  our var was million  including our generating capacity and power sales agreements with allegheny energy s regulated utility subsidiaries 
m allegheny energy supply company  llc and subsidiaries for  our average var using the same calculation was million 
we also calculated var using the full term of all trading positions  but excluded our generating capacity and the provider of last resort retail load obligations of allegheny energy s regulated utility subsidiaries 
this calculation includes positions beyond three years for which there is a limited  observable  liquid market 
as a result  this calculation is based upon management s best estimates and modeling assumptions  which could materially differ from actual results 
as of december   this calculation yielded a var of million 
at december   our var was million 
this calculation included contracts and positions for the next months and our generating assets  the provider of last resort retail load obligations of allegheny energy s regulated utility subsidiaries  retail  and other similar obligations 
this calculation method was used prior to the purchase of merrill lynch s energy marketing and trading business 
as of december   the comparable var was million 
the decrease in var for was primarily due to a reduction in the volatility of energy prices in we have entered into long term arrangements with initial terms of months or longer to purchase approximately of base fuel requirements for our owned generation in we depend on short term arrangements and spot purchases for our remaining requirements 
new accounting standards in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these standards significantly changed the accounting for business combinations and goodwill in two significant ways 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  use of the pooling of interests method will be prohibited 
we do not expect sfas no 
to have a material effect on us 
sfas no 
changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
amortization of goodwill  including goodwill recorded in past business combinations  will cease upon adoption of the standard  which for us was january  our goodwill will now be tested at least annually for impairment 
intangible assets other than goodwill will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment 
as of december   we had million of goodwill 
our goodwill amortization was million in we are in the process of evaluating the effect of adopting sfas no 
on our results of operations and financial position and plan to reflect the results of this evaluation in our first quarter financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability will be accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost will be depreciated over the useful life of the asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either will settle the obligation for its recorded amount or incur a gain or loss upon settlement 
we will be evaluating the effect of adopting sfas no 
on our results of operations and financial position prior to our adoption of the standard on january  in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this standard  which we adopted on january   establishes one accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  including discontinued operations  and carries forward the general impairment provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on us

credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty to a transaction will be unable to fulfill its contractual obligations 
the credit standing of counterparties is established through the evaluation of the prospective counterparty s financial condition  specified collateral requirements where deemed necessary  and the use of standardized agreements  which facilitate netting of cash flows  associated with a single counterparty 
financial conditions of existing counterparties are monitored on an ongoing basis 
ae supply s independent risk management group oversees credit risk 
as of december   ae supply has received million of cash collateral from counterparties involved in ae supply s energy trading activities 
ae supply is engaged in various trading activities in which counterparties primarily include electric and gas utilities  independent power producers  oil and gas exploration and production companies  energy marketers  and commercial and industrial customers 
in the event the counterparties do not fulfill their obligations  ae supply may be exposed to credit risk 
the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty or issuer of the instrument 
ae supply has a concentration of customers in the electric and natural gas utility and oil and gas exploration and production industries 
these concentrations in customers may affect ae supply s overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that the customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions 
the following table provides the net fair value of commodity contract asset positions by counterparty credit quality for ae supply at december  credit quality amount millions of dollars investment grade non investment grade no external ratings governmental agencies other total where a parent company provided a guarantee for a counterparty  ae supply used the parent company s credit rating 
the net fair value of billion  or of ae supply s total assets  for no external ratings government agencies mainly relates to ae supply s power sales agreement with the cdwr  the department within the state government of california that is responsible for buying electricity for that state 
as of december   the cdwr did not receive a credit rating from an external  independent credit rating agency 
on february   the california puc approved a rate agreement with the cdwr in order for the cdwr to issue bonds to repay the state of california s general fund and other outstanding loans 
the agreement would create two streams of revenue for the cdwr by establishing bond charges and power charges on electricity customers 
revenues from power charges will be used to pay the cdwr s operating expenses  including payment of its long term power purchase agreements 
certain  as yet unspecified  operating expenses of the cdwr will be payable from the bond charge 
the rate agreement would require the cdwr to use its best efforts to renegotiate its long term power agreements and does not limit the ability of the california puc or the cdwr to engage in litigation regarding those contracts 
if ae supply s agreement were renegotiated or if the cdwr failed for any reason to meet its obligations under this agreement  the value of the agreement as an asset might need to be reduced on ae supply s consolidated balance sheet  with a corresponding reduction in net income 
as of december   the cdwr has met all of its obligations under this agreement 
on february   the california puc and the california caeob filed a complaint with the ferc seeking to abrogate various contracts to which the cdwr is a counterparty  including two contracts with ae supply to sell power to the cdwr 
the california puc alleges that the contracts are unjust and unreasonable due to market dysfunction and the exercise of market power by electricity suppliers during in california 
as a result  the california puc argues that the cdwr was forced to pay prices that are too high and accept onerous terms and conditions 
in the alternative  the california puc requests that the ferc reform the challenged contracts to provide just and reasonable pricing  reduce the duration of the contracts  and eliminate certain non price items 
ae supply believes that its contracts with the cdwr are valid and binding upon the cdwr 
ae supply has evaluated the complaint filed by the california puc and responded 
at this time  ae supply cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding 
on december   various enron corporation entities  including but not limited to  enron north america corporation and enron power marketing  inc  collectively enron  filed voluntary petitions for chapter reorganization with the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york 
ae supply and enron have master trading agreements in place  which include an international swaps and dealers association isda agreement  master power purchase and sale agreement  and a master gas purchase and sale agreement agreements 
within all of these agreements  there is netting and set off language 
this language allows ae supply and enron to net and set off all amounts owed to each other under the agreements 
pursuant to the agreements  the voluntary petition for chapter reorganization by enron constituted an event of default 
ae supply effected an early termination as of november   with respect to each of the agreements  as permitted under the terms of the agreements 
based upon ae supply s analysis of the agreements and the bankruptcy code  ae supply believes that its netting and set off procedure is enforceable 
ae supply understands that there can be no guarantee of this analysis until the bankruptcy court has made a decision 
both ae supply and enron are in the business in whole or in part of entering into forward contracts with merchants in a commodity or goods or interests or rights therein 
the bankruptcy code provides protections to entities  like ae supply  that enter into such forward contracts 
the automatic stay that arose under section of the bankruptcy code upon the commencement of enron s bankruptcy case should not preclude the termination by ae supply of each transaction under the agreements 
generally  within the industry  power and commodity purchase transactions effected between ae supply and enron calling for physical delivery of power or commodities as opposed to swap transactions would be viewed as forward contracts within the meaning of the bankruptcy code  and ae supply and enron would be forward contract merchants 
the bankruptcy code expressly permits the non debtor party to certain types of contracts  such as forward contracts and swaps  to terminate and liquidate the contracts after the commencement of a bankruptcy case as the result of a bankruptcy default 
section provides  among other things  that the contractual right of a forward contract merchant to cause the liquidation of a forward contract pursuant to a bankruptcy termination clause will not be stayed  avoided  or otherwise limited by operation of any provision of the bankruptcy code or by the order of any court in any proceeding under the bankruptcy code 
similarly  section provides  among other things  that the contractual right of any swap participant to cause the termination of a swap agreement pursuant to a bankruptcy termination clause or to offset or net out any termination values or payment amounts under or in connection with a swap agreement shall not be stayed  avoided  or otherwise limited by operation of any provision of the bankruptcy code or by order of a court or administrative agency in any proceeding under the bankruptcy code 
finally  section of the bankruptcy code  among other things  authorizes the set off of any mutual deb ts and claims arising from forward contracts and swaps between a debtor and a non debtor 
thus  pursuant to sections and of the bankruptcy code  ae supply believes it has appropriately exercised its contractual rights to terminate the agreements and to net out transactions arising within each agreement 
pursuant to section of the bankruptcy code  ae supply believes it should be able to offset any termination values or payment amounts owed it against amounts it owes to enron as a result of the netting 
after applying the netting provisions of the agreements  including any collateral posted by enron with ae supply  approximately million was expensed as uncollectible in ae supply continues to evaluate its enron transactions on a daily basis 
market risk 
market risk arises from the potential for changes in the value of energy related to price and volatility in the market 
ae supply reduces these risks by using its generating assets and contractual generation under its control to back positions on physical transactions 
aggregate and counterparty market risk exposure and credit risk limits are monitored within the guidelines of the corporate energy risk policy 
ae supply evaluates commodity price risk  operational risk  and credit risk in establishing the fair value of commodity contracts 
ae supply uses various methods to measure its exposure to market risk  including a value at risk model var 
var is a statistical model that attempts to predict risk of loss based on historical market price and volatility data over a given period of time 
the quantification of market risk using var provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products with different risk factors to set the overall corporate risks tolerance  determine risk targets  and positions 
ae supply calculates var using a variance covariance technique that models option positions  using a linear approximation of their value based upon the options delta equivalents 
due to inherent limitations of var  including the use of approximations to value options  subjectivity in the choice of liquidation period  and reliance on historical data to calibrate the model  the var calculation may not accurately reflect ae supply s market risk exposure 
as a result  the actual changes in ae supply s market risk sensitive instruments could differ from the calculated var  and such changes could have a material effect on its financial results 
in addition to var  ae supply routinely performs stress and scenario analyses to measure extreme losses due to exceptional events 
the var and stress test results are reviewed to determine the maximum allowable reduction in the fair value of the energy trading portfolios 
ae supply s var calculation includes all contracts  whether financially or physically settled  associated with its wholesale marketing and trading of electricity  natural gas  and other commodities 
ae supply calculates the var  including its generating capacity and the power sales agreements for the regulated utility subsidiaries provider of last resort retail load obligations 
the var calculation does not include positions beyond three years because there is a limited observable  liquid market 
the var calculation also does not include commodity price exposure related to the procurement of fuel for its generation 
ae supply believes that this represents the most complete calculation of its value at risk 
the var amount represents the potential loss in fair value from the market risk sensitive positions described above over a one day holding period with a percent confidence level 
as of december   ae supply s var was million  including its generating capacity and power sales agreements with the distribution companies 
for  ae supply s average var  using the same calculation  was million 
ae supply also calculated var using the full term of all trading positions  but excluded its generating capacity and the provider of last resort retail load obligations of the distribution companies 
this calculation includes positions beyond three years for which there is a limited  observable  liquid market 
as a result  this calculation is based upon management s best estimates and modeling assumptions  which could materially differ from actual results 
as of december   this calculation yielded a var of million 
at december   ae supply s var was million 
this calculation included contracts and positions for the next months and ae supply s generating assets  its provider of last resort retail load obligations of the distribution companies  retail  and other similar obligations 
this calculation method was used prior to the purchase of an energy trading business 
as of december   the comparable var was million 
the decrease in var for was primarily due to a reduction in the volatility of energy prices in ae supply and monongahela have entered into long term arrangements with original terms of months or longer to purchase approximately of its base coal requirements for its owned generation in ae supply and monongahela depend on short term arrangements and spot purchases for their remaining requirements
