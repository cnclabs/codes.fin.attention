on july   we renamed the business and consumer division from its prior name  the personal web video division  but did not change the structure or operations of this division 
we will refer to this division as the business and consumer division  although as of june  it was still named the personal web video division 
industry background the development of a video program involves three distinct processes pre production  which involves planning and preparation for the recording of the video program  production  which involves the acquisition of video material shooting  and post production  which involves the organization of raw video segments acquired in the production phase into a cohesive and appealing program editing 
during the post production phase  elements such as titles  graphics  and transitions between video segments are incorporated to enhance the overall quality and impact of a video program 
historically  the video production industry has focused on providing program material for broadcast television and advertising 
to create high quality video programs  producers have traditionally used expensive  dedicated video production equipment linked together in a complex interconnected system to form a video editing suite 
typical video editing suites incorporate video recorders  switchers  digital video effects systems  still image management systems  character generators  electronic paint systems and other products  often provided by multiple manufacturers 
these video editing suites require highly skilled personnel to operate and maintain 
recently  new and expanding channels of video content distribution  including cable television  direct satellite broadcast  video rentals  cd rom  dvd  video on demand  and the internet  have led to a rapid increase in demand for video content for a wide variety of applications 
this demand has driven the market for editing approaches that are less expensive and easier to use 
new commercial and industrial applications for this market include multimedia entertainment  video games  music videos  special event videos  education and training and corporate communications 
in addition  the popularity of camcorders  vcrs  dvd players  and personal computers has fueled the growth of an emerging consumer market for low cost video production technology that enables consumers to create and edit home videos 
these expanding channels of video content distribution and new applications are increasing the demand for video content production and distribution tools 
computer based video solutions combining personal computers with specialized video processing technology can now provide video quality comparable to that of traditional tape based editing suites at significantly lower cost 
as a result  these computer based video solutions are replacing the traditional tape based editing suites 
in addition  such solutions are often easier to use since they incorporate common applications and are based on open it platforms 
coupled with innovative and technology leading software  the lower cost and ease of use of computer based video tools enable large numbers of creative individuals  previously untrained in video production  to produce professional quality video programming 
this programming can be used in traditional ways  such as broadcasting over the air  via satellite  used in homes and businesses 
in addition  the growing popularity of dvd  vcd and the internet provides entirely new channels of communicating through the use of video 
strategy our goal is to take advantage of the growing traditional and internet video opportunities to become the global leader of video for the home  the studio and on the air 
as broadband capability continues to increase  the need to create  edit  store  stream and view high quality video becomes more urgent 
we have a proven ability to successfully migrate technology developed for broadcasters down to the professional and even the consumer markets  and we are now moving aggressively toward web based solutions in each of our business divisions

the national academy of television arts and sciences outstanding technical achievement emmy award has been awarded to us on five occasions 
in  we received an emmy for pioneering the concept of the video workstation 
in  we received an emmy for developing technology  which allows real time mapping of live video onto animated d surfaces and  in  we received an emmy for utilization of real time video manipulation technology in non linear editing applications 
in  we received an emmy for pioneering development in full motion broadcast quality pc video and compression plug in cards utilized in the manufacture of non linear editing systems and video servers 
in  we received an emmy for the pioneering development in shared video data storage for use in television video servers 
in addition  the technology that we acquired from digital graphix was awarded two emmy s prior to its acquisition by us 
montage was also awarded one emmy  prior to its acquisition by us  for enabling technology and for non linear editing systems using digital imaging and sound 
many of our products share a common internal architecture 
this design approach allows us to leverage our research and development expenditures by utilizing similar hardware and software modules in multiple products 
our video manipulation architecture is fundamental to the performance and capabilities of our products 
as a result of the acquisition of the video division of miro computer products ag in august  we acquired video capture technology that allows high quality live video and audio to be captured and played back from a standard personal computer 
we further developed and augmented this technology with the acquisition of truevision  inc in march and with the acquisition of fast multimedia in october all of our products use or work with a standard personal computer for control of video manipulation functions 
in all products targeting the broadcast market  the control microprocessor is embedded within the product 
the professional and consumer products are inserted into or connect externally to a personal computer 
the use of industry standard microprocessors offers three main advantages over traditional video products lower software development costs due to the availability of powerful off the shelf software development tools  lower product manufacturing costs due to the low costs of standard microprocessors  and the ability to integrate third party software such as networking or d rendering software to provide additional functionality 
essentially all real time video manipulation must be performed on uncompressed video data 
since uncompressed digital video rates are too high to be processed by a microprocessor in real time  video signals are internally distributed over a separate high speed digital video bus  or dvb  and processed using our proprietary real time video manipulation hardware 
the video data on the dvb is processed in the standard digital component format that fully complies with the highest digital component video standards of the international radio consultation committee  an organization that develops and publishes standards for international telecommunication systems 
the software in our video capture and video manipulation products is divided into two layers the user interface application and the applied programming interface 
the user interface application is different and has been optimized for each product family 
the applied programming interface is  for the most part  common to most of our products and incorporates all the proprietary low level routines that allow our products to perform high quality  real time video manipulations 
this software architecture has three main advantages real time video manipulation algorithms that are complex and difficult to develop can be used in multiple products  the user interface can be tailored to meet specific user requirements  and applications can be quickly ported to our products using the applied programming interface 
our core technical expertise is in real time digital video processing  video capture technology  real time software algorithms  video input output  advanced user interfaces and software control of commercially available camcorders and vcrs 
real time digital video processing 
we have devoted significant resources to the development of proprietary technology for real time video processing  including high speed digital filters  image transformation buffers  plane and perspective addressing  and non linear image manipulation 
we have patented technology related to real time mapping of live video onto multiple  complex  animated d shapes and surfaces 
this technology includes a proprietary data compression algorithm that compresses the address information and allows decompression of this data in real time 
codec technology 
we have devoted significant resources to developing and acquiring hardware and software for real time video capture  or codec 
this technology includes audio video effect synchronization methodologies  compression algorithms  drivers and software for real time playback from disks 
real time software algorithms 
the digital video manipulation functions of our products use common core software that performs complex computations in real time under user control 
we have developed certain algorithms that enable the high speed computation of multiple complex equations that are required for real time video effects 
video input output 
we have developed technology for video input and output of composite analog  component analog and component digital video data streams 
all of our products work with the national television standards committee  or ntsc  and phase alternating line  or pal  which are the two primary television standards in north america and europe  respectively 
in addition  we have developed interfaces to support input output of video streams stored on computer disks 
user interface design 
we have extensive experience in the design of graphical user interfaces for video control and manipulation 
we use interactive  menu driven user interfaces to control video manipulation functions 
we have historically devoted a significant portion of our resources to engineering and product development programs and expect to continue to allocate significant resources to these efforts 
in addition  we have acquired certain products and technologies that have aided our ability to more rapidly develop and market new products 
our future operating results will depend to a considerable extent on our ability to continually develop  acquire  introduce and deliver new hardware and software products that offer our customers additional features and enhanced performance at competitive prices 
delays in the introduction or shipment of new or enhanced products  our inability to timely develop and introduce such new products  the failure of such products to gain market acceptance or problems associated with product transitions could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  particularly on a quarterly basis 
as of june   we had people engaged in engineering and product development 
our engineering and product development expenses excluding purchased in process research and development in fiscal  and were million  million and million respectively  and represented  and  respectively  of net sales 
employees as of june   we employed people worldwide 
customers end users of our products range from individuals to major corporate and government entities  and to video production and broadcast facilities worldwide 
broadcast customers include domestic and international television and cable networks  local broadcasters and program creators

consumer customers include consumer and prosumer users who edit video and create professional looking home movies  corporate presentations  and other special events and productions using a standard personal computer and camcorder 
marketing  sales and service marketing our marketing efforts are targeted at users of broadcast and professional production suites  and home video editing enthusiasts 
in order to increase awareness of our products  we attend a number of trade shows  the major ones being the national association of broadcasters  or nab  show in the united states  and the international broadcasters convention  or ibc  show and the center for office and information technology  or cebit  show in europe 
we also use targeted direct mail campaigns and advertisements in trade and computer publications for most of our product lines and also participate in joint marketing activities with our oem partners and other professional video companies 
sales we maintain a sales organization consisting of regional sales managers in the united states  europe  asia and latin america 
we currently have sales offices in twelve countries worldwide that support sales into those countries and a number of other countries 
the regional sales managers are primarily responsible for supporting independent dealers and vars and making direct sales in geographic regions without dealer coverage 
they also service customers who prefer to transact directly with us 
our sales organization focuses on a variety of distribution channels  including oems  value added resellers  or vars  distributors  retail stores and other resellers 
we believe that our development of a worldwide sales and distribution organization gives us a strategic advantage in the rapidly changing broadcast  professional  and consumer video industry 
we intend to persist in strengthening and developing this organization and to continue to develop strong strategic relationships with key oems and resellers 
we sell our broadcast and professional products to end users through an established domestic and international network of independent video product dealers and vars in addition to direct sales 
the independent dealers and vars are selected for their ability to provide effective field sales and technical support to our customers 
dealers and vars carry our broadcast and professional products as demonstration units  advise customers on system configuration and installation and perform ongoing post sales customer support 
we believe that many end users depend on the technical support offered by these dealers in making product purchase decisions 
we continue to invest resources in developing and supporting our network of independent dealers and vars 
these groups promote our products and expand our market coverage 
we also sell and distribute our professional products to oems that incorporate our products into their video editing products and resell these products to other resellers and end users 
these oems generally purchase our products and are responsible for conducting their own marketing  sales and support activities 
we attempt to identify  and align with  oems that are market share and technology leaders in our target markets 
our consumer products are sold primarily through the consumer retail channel via large distributors  vars  oems  and large computer and electronic retailers  in addition to direct telemarketing  mail order and over the internet 
there can be no assurance that any particular computer retailers will continue to stock and sell our consumer products 
if a significant number of computer retailers were to discontinue selling those products or if sales returns are higher than anticipated  our results of operations would be adversely affected 
sales into the consumer retail channel entail a number of risks including inventory obsolescence  product returns and potential price protection obligations 
sales outside of north america represent a significant portion of our business  and we expect that sales outside of the united states will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales 
we make foreign currency denominated sales in many countries  especially in europe  exposing us to risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
this risk is partially hedged since all local selling and marketing expenses are also denominated in those same currencies 
international sales and operations may also be subject to risks such as the imposition of governmental controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  political instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  potential insolvency of international dealers and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have an adverse effect on our future international sales and  consequently  on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
service and support we believe that our ability to provide customer service and support is an important element in the marketing of our products 
our customer service and support operation also provides us with a means of understanding customer requirements for future product enhancements 
we maintain an in house repair facility  supplemented by authorized third party service providers and also provide telephone access to our technical support staff 
our technical support engineers not only provide assistance in diagnosing problems  but also work closely with customers to address system integration issues and to assist customers in increasing the efficiency and productivity of their systems 
our customers may choose from a variety of support offerings  including internet access  telephone support  hardware replacement  software updates and factory repairs 
for selected products  we offer hour day emergency phone support and advance parts exchange with same business day shipment 
we support our customers in europe and asia primarily through our international sales offices  worldwide parts distribution network  and local dealers 
we typically warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship for varying periods depending on the product and the sales region 
we believe our warranties are similar to those offered by other video production equipment suppliers 
to date  we have not encountered any significant product maintenance problems 
competition the video production equipment market is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  new product development and obsolescence  evolving industry standards and significant price erosion over the life of a product 
competition is fragmented with several hundred manufacturers supplying a variety of products to this market 
we anticipate increased competition in the video production equipment market from both existing manufacturers and new market entrants 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
competition for our broadcast products is generally based on product performance  breadth of product line  service and support  market presence and price 
our principal competitors in this market include chyron corporation  leitch technology corporation  matsushita electric industrial co 
ltd  or matsushita  quantel ltd 
a division of carlton communications plc  seachange corporation  sony corporation  or sony  and thomson multimedia  some of which have greater financial  technical  marketing  sales and customer support resources  greater name recognition and larger installed customer bases than us 
in addition  some of these companies have established relationships with current and potential customers of ours 
some of our competitors also offer a wide variety of video equipment  including professional video tape recorders  video cameras and other related equipment 
in some cases  these competitors may have a competitive advantage based upon their ability to bundle their equipment in certain large system sales 
our competition in the professional and consumer markets comes from a number of groups of video companies such as traditional video equipment suppliers  providers of desktop editing solutions  video software application companies and others 
suppliers of traditional video equipment such as matsushita and sony have the financial resources and technical know how to develop high quality  real time video manipulation products for the desktop video market 
suppliers of professional media products such as adobe systems inc  avid  matrox electronics systems  ltd  media  inc  have established video distribution channels and experience in marketing video products and significant financial resources 
we believe that the consumer video editing market is still emerging and as well the sources of competition 
there are several established video companies that are currently offering products or solutions that compete directly or indirectly with our consumer products by providing some or all of the same features and video editing capabilities  such as dazzle multimedia  roxio  and ulead 
in addition  we expect that existing manufacturers and new market entrants will develop new  higher performance  lower cost consumer video products that may compete directly with our consumer products 
we may also face competition from other computer companies that lack experience in the video production industry but that have substantial resources to acquire or develop technology and products for the video production market 
there can be no assurance that any of these companies will not enter into the video production market or that we could successfully compete against them if they did 
manufacturing and suppliers our manufacturing and logistics operations  located in the us and germany  consist primarily of testing printed circuit assemblies  final product assembly  configuration and testing  quality assurance and shipping for our broadcast and professional products 
manufacturing of our business and consumer products is performed by independent subcontractors located in the us  germany and china 
each of our products undergoes quality inspection and testing at the board level and final assembly stage 
we manage our materials with a software system that integrates purchasing  inventory control and cost accounting 
we rely on independent subcontractors who manufacture to our specifications our consumer and certain professional products and major subassemblies used in our broadcast and professional products 
this approach allows us to concentrate our manufacturing resources on areas where we believe we can add the most value  such as product testing and final assembly  and reduces the fixed costs of owning and operating a full scale manufacturing facility 
we have manufacturing agreements with a number of us based subcontractors  which include flash electronics and benchmark electronics  for the manufacture of our broadcast and professional products 
we have a manufacturing agreement with streiff helmold gmbh  which is located in braunschweig  germany  for the manufacture of our business and consumer products 
our reliance on subcontractors to manufacture products and major subassemblies involves a number of significant risks including the loss of control over the manufacturing process  the potential absence of adequate capacity  the unavailability of or interruptions in access to certain process technologies and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  quality and costs 
in the event that any significant subcontractor was to become unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture these products or subassemblies in required volumes  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
to the extent possible  we and our manufacturing subcontractors use standard parts and components available from multiple vendors 
however  we and our subcontractors are dependent upon single or limited source suppliers for a number of key components and parts used in our products  including integrated circuits manufactured by altera corporation  auravision corporation  lsi logic corp  maxim integrated products  inc  national semiconductor corporation  philips electronics  inc  raytheon corporation and zoran corporation  field programmable gate arrays manufactured by altera corporation and xilinx  inc and software applications from adobe 
our manufacturing subcontractors generally purchase these single or limited source components pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time in the ordinary course of business  do not carry significant inventories of these components and have no guaranteed supply arrangements with such suppliers 
in addition  the availability of many of these components to our manufacturing subcontractors is dependent in part on our ability to provide our manufacturers  and their ability to provide suppliers  with accurate forecasts of our future requirements 
we and our manufacturing subcontractors endeavor to maintain ongoing communication with their suppliers to guard against interruptions in supply 
we and our subcontractors have in the past experienced delays in receiving adequate supplies of single source components 
also  because of the reliance on these single or limited source components  we may be subject to increases in component costs that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
any extended interruption or reduction in the future supply of any key components currently obtained from a single or limited source could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations in any given period 
our broadcast and professional customers generally order on an as needed basis 
we generally ship our products within days of receipt of an order  depending on customer requirements  although certain customers  including oems  may place substantial orders with the expectation that shipments will be staged over several months 
a substantial majority of product shipments in a period relate to orders received in that period  and accordingly  we generally operate with a limited backlog of orders 
the absence of a significant historical backlog means that quarterly results are difficult to predict and delays in product delivery and in the closing of sales near the end of a quarter can cause quarterly revenues to fall below anticipated levels 
in addition  our customers may cancel or reschedule orders without significant penalty and the prices of products may be adjusted between the time the purchase order is booked into backlog and the time the product is shipped to the customer 
as a result of these factors  we believe that the backlog of orders as of any particular date is not necessarily indicative of our actual sales for any future period 
proprietary rights and licenses our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue and profit growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our proprietary technology 
in addition  we generally enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our employees and oem customers and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary technology 
we currently hold a number of united states patents covering certain aspects of our technologies 
although we intend to pursue a policy of obtaining patents for appropriate inventions  we believe that the success of our business will depend primarily on the innovative skills  technical expertise and marketing abilities of our personnel  rather than upon the ownership of patents 
certain technology used in our products is licensed from third parties on a royalty bearing basis 
such royalties to date have not been  and are not expected to be  material 
generally  such agreements grant us nonexclusive  worldwide rights with respect to the subject technology and terminate only upon a material breach by us 
in the course of our business  we may receive and in the past have received communications asserting that our products infringe patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
our policy is to investigate the factual basis of such communications and to negotiate licenses where appropriate 
while it may be necessary or desirable in the future to obtain licenses relating to one or more of our products  or relating to current or future technologies  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
there can be no assurance that such communications can be settled on commercially reasonable terms or that they will not result in protracted and costly litigation 
there has been substantial industry litigation regarding patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights involving technology companies 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce any patents issued to us  to protect our trade secrets  trademarks and other intellectual property rights owned by us  or to defend us against claimed infringement 
any such litigation could be costly and a diversion of management s attention  either of which could have material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
adverse determinations in such litigation could result in the loss of our proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from manufacturing or selling its products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item properties our principal administrative  marketing  manufacturing and product development facility is located in mountain view  california 
this facility occupies approximately  square feet pursuant to a lease which commenced august  and which will terminate december  we lease space in braunschweig  germany which houses engineering  administrative  logistics and marketing operations for our consumer products

montage group  ltd 
and digital editing services  inc des  wholly owned subsidiaries of pinnacle systems  no 
c was filed in the sixth judicial circuit court for pinellas county  florida referred to as athle tech claim 
the athle tech claim alleges that montage breached a purported software development agreement between athle tech computer systems  incorporated  or athle tech  and montage 
the athle tech claim also alleges that des intentionally interfered with athle tech s claimed rights with respect to the purported athle tech agreement and was unjustly enriched as a result 
finally  athle tech seeks a declaratory judgment against des and montage 
we deny any liability relating to the athle tech claim and are vigorously defending the case 
the parties are currently engaged in the discovery process

the court denied both motions 
a trial date is currently set for february we have not accrued any liability related to this contingency since a liability cannot be reasonably estimated 
in march  we acquired des 
pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger dated as of march  between des  acquisition corporation  the former des shareholders and the company  the former des shareholders were entitled to an earnout payable in shares of our common stock if the des operating profits exceeded at least of the des revenues during the period from march  until march  in october  we entered into an amendment to the des agreement and plan of merger with the former des shareholders to provide for an earnout based on the combined revenues  expenses and operating profits of des and avid sports  inc due to the combination of the des and avid sports  inc divisions in july in april  we determined that no earnout payment was payable 
in may  the former des shareholders asserted that an earnout payment was payable 
in accordance with the des agreement and plan of merger  in october the parties submitted this matter to an independent arbitrator 
currently  the des earnout arbitration is ongoing 
we have not accrued any liability related to this contingency since a liability cannot be reasonably estimated 
we are engaged in certain additional legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we believe that we have adequate legal defenses and that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations or liquidity  although there can be no assurance as to the outcome of such litigation

this overall net sales decrease was partially offset by an increase in our north america sales  which was primarily due to new product introductions in our business and consumer division  new retail customers  and increases in sales of solutions used by broadcasters in live to air applications 
for the fiscal year ended june   the broadcast and professional division represented of our total sales  while the business and consumer division represented of our total sales 
for the fiscal year ended june   the broadcast and professional division represented of our total sales  while the business and consumer division represented of our total sales 
broadcast and professional sales decreased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  broadcast and professional sales decreased because of decreases in sales of our content creation products and team sports systems  which were partially offset by increases in sales of solutions used by broadcasters in live to air applications 
business and consumer sales increased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  the business and consumer sales increase was due to some of our new business products  which include pro one  that was introduced to the market in august  and our new consumer software products  including studio version editing software  that shipped in june  and pinnacle express dvd authoring software  that was introduced to the market in september we also added new retail customers during the fiscal year ended june  these sales increases were mostly offset by decreased sales of products aimed at the business market  which include the dv  dcplus  dc  and dc products 
since a majority of our business and consumer sales are directed toward the consumer  we usually experience an increase in sales during the second quarter of our fiscal year due to the holiday buying season 
our business and consumer sales have  in the past  increased from the first quarter to the second quarter of our fiscal year and  subsequently  decreased from the second quarter to the third quarter of our fiscal year 
during fiscal  our business and consumer sales increased from the first quarter to the second quarter  and subsequently  decreased from the second quarter to the third quarter 
although sales only decreased from the second quarter to the third quarter of fiscal  the level of sales for the third quarter of fiscal was at approximately the same level as the third quarter of fiscal during fiscal  our business and consumer sales increased from the first quarter to the second quarter and  subsequently  decreased from the second quarter to the third quarter 
during fiscal  our business and consumer sales increased from the first quarter to the second quarter and  subsequently  decreased from the second quarter to the third quarter 
in an effort to reduce costs during the quarter ended december   we effectively shut down our operations for one week during the thanksgiving holiday and for the holiday week during the last week of december this shut down resulted in the majority of our employees taking vacation during the shut down periods  which reduced our operating expenses during the quarter ended december  we did not have similar savings during the quarters ended march  and june  deferred revenue increased to million as of june  from million as of june  this increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to an increase in large system sales in our broadcast and professional division 
as of june  and  we billed certain customers for several installments but did not recognize associated revenue as the recognition criteria were not yet met with these large system sales 
we will recognize the revenue for these large system sales upon the completion of installation and customer acceptance 
the following is a summary of revenues by region fiscal year ended june increase decrease in thousands region north america international total revenues for the fiscal years ended june  and june   international sales sales outside of north america represented and of our net sales  respectively  while north america sales represented and of our net sales  respectively 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our total net sales 
international sales decreased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  international sales decreased primarily due to decreased sales in europe and the asia pacific region resulting from the economic downturn 
north america sales increased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  north america sales increased primarily due to new product introductions in our business and consumer division  as described above  and new retail and oem customers  which was partially offset by the economic downturn 
gross margins we distribute and sell our products to end users through a combination of independent domestic and international dealers  vars  retailers  distributors  oems and  to a lesser extent  a direct sales force 
sales to dealers  vars  retailers  distributors and oems are generally at a discount to the published list prices 
the amount of discount  and consequently  our gross margins  varies depending on the product  the channel of distribution  the volume of product purchased and other factors 
in addition to direct material costs  cost of sales includes costs related to the procurement of components and subassemblies  labor and overhead associated with procurement  assembly and testing of finished products  inventory management  warehousing  shipping  warranty costs  royalties and provisions for excess or obsolescence and shrinkage 
in the fiscal year ended june   our total gross margins as a percentage of net sales increased to from in the fiscal year ended june  included in the cost of sales for the fiscal year ended june  was a million inventory charge related to the write down of products used in our vortex news systems  which are included in our broadcast and professional division 
this million inventory charge was recorded in the quarter ended september   and resulted from upgrading our targa product with our targa product a component of our vortex news systems  which is included in our broadcast and professional division 
as a result  we recorded a million inventory charge to write down inventory related to the targa as of june   this million of written down inventory was not yet scrapped or sold 
we intend to disclose any material impact of subsequent disposition on gross margin 
included in the cost of sales for the fiscal year ended june  was a million inventory charge  consisting of a million charge and a million charge in the first and fourth quarters  respectively  of the charges related to discontinued products and accessories of which million related to the broadcast and professional division and million related to the business and consumer division 
these inventory charges were part of reorganizations we implemented in each of the first and fourth quarters of fiscal  as described in more detail below and in the section entitled general and administrative 
during the quarter ended september   we reorganized our internal reporting structure to facilitate better and more efficient reporting and to increase internal accountability 
in conjunction with this reorganization  we streamlined our product line offerings by discontinuing certain products  including primarily alladin and the g and g versions of the media stream servers  and by writing down excess targa and dvd inventory to its net realizable value 
this resulted in an inventory charge of million to reduce the inventory carrying value to its estimated net realizable value on the secondary parts market 
this inventory was subsequently sold on the secondary parts market for approximately its revised carrying amount 
as a result of this reorganization  we increased the effectiveness of our internal processes and streamlined our product offerings  which we expect will indirectly improve our operating results over time 
we do not expect the reorganization to have a significant direct effect on future earnings 
during the quarter ended june   we reorganized further and streamlined our operations into three distinct divisions the broadcast solutions division  the professional media division and the business and consumer division 
each of these divisions was given full profit and loss responsibility 
as part of this reorganization  which was implemented to reduce operating losses in response to decreased sales  we reevaluated our product offerings and better aligned them within our distribution channels 
this reevaluation led to the discontinuance of certain products in an effort to simplify our manufacturing  sales and marketing processes and to more rapidly transition to newer product designs 
as a result  we recorded a million inventory charge to write down inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
the discontinued products primarily consisted of certain versions of our pctv  thunder  dc  dc  dv  dv and mp products 
the simplified product lines resulted in improved efficiencies in marketing  sales  and manufacturing 
as of june   most of this inventory was scrapped or sold on the secondary parts market with no material impact on gross margins 
we intend to disclose any material impact of subsequent disposition on gross margin 
excluding the million inventory charge  which was recorded in the quarter ended september   gross margins would have been in the fiscal year ended june  excluding the million inventory charge  consisting of a million charge and a million charge in the first and fourth quarters  respectively  of  gross margins would have been in the fiscal year ended june  the increase in our overall gross margins for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  was due to increased gross margins in both the business and consumer and the broadcast and professional divisions 
business and consumer gross margins increased to in the fiscal year ended june  from in the fiscal year ended june  excluding the million inventory charge  which was recorded in the quarter ended june   business and consumer gross margins would have been in the fiscal year ended june  the increase in business and consumer gross margins was primarily due to a more favorable mix of higher margin product sales  as well as higher oem sales 
broadcast and professional gross margins increased to in the fiscal year ended june  from in the fiscal year ended june  excluding the million inventory charge  which was recorded in the quarter ended september   broadcast and professional gross margins would have been in the fiscal year ended june  excluding the million inventory charge  consisting of a million charge and a million charge in the first and fourth quarters  respectively  of  broadcast and professional gross margins would have been in the fiscal year ended june  the increase in broadcast and professional gross margins was primarily due to a decrease in manufacturing overhead costs  as a percentage of sales  because of more efficient operations and reduced manufacturing spending 
the increase was also attributable to higher support sales  which generated higher margins  lower material costs  and a more favorable product mix towards live to air products 
engineering and product development engineering and product development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products and enhancements of existing products and consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  prototype and development expenses  depreciation and facility costs 
engineering and product development expenses decreased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  this decrease was primarily due to our efforts to reduce engineering expenses commensurate with our lower revenue for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  as a percentage of sales  engineering and product development expenses were relatively consistent at in the fiscal year ended june  compared to in the fiscal year ended june  we believe that investment in research and development is crucial to our future growth and position in the industry and expect to continue to allocate significant resources to all of our engineering and product development locations throughout the world 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses include compensation and benefits for sales and marketing personnel  commissions  travel  advertising and promotional expenses including channel marketing funds and trade shows  and professional fees for marketing services 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  as a percentage of net sales  sales and marketing expenditures increased to in the fiscal year ended june  from in the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily due to the broader sales organization that we established in our business and consumer division in an effort to better serve the various local markets 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for administrative  executive  finance and management information systems personnel  legal and accounting fees  it infrastructure costs  bad debt expense  and other corporate administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses were and in the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
this increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in personnel  which was partially offset by lower reorganizations costs incurred during the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  as discussed in the gross margins section  above  we completed reorganizations in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal during the quarter ended september   we reorganized our internal reporting structure by changing the organizational structure in order to facilitate better and more efficient internal reporting of the results of its business units 
this reorganization required a modest reduction in headcount due to the more efficient organizational structure  resulting in involuntary termination expenses of million  consisting primarily of severance for employees that were terminated during the quarter ended september  we believe this reorganization improved internal accountability 
during the quarter ended june   we reorganized further and streamlined our operations into three distinct divisions the broadcast solutions division  the professional media division and the business and consumer division 
each of these divisions was given full profit and loss responsibility 
as part of this reorganization  which was implemented to reduce operating losses in response to decreased sales  we eliminated certain redundant positions  resulting in involuntary termination expenses of approximately million related to severance and associated costs related to employees that were terminated during the quarter 
as a result of this reorganization and a reduction in discretionary spending  we significantly decreased total operating expenses by approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal however  operating expenses increased during the fiscal year ended compared to the fiscal year ended  net of the acquisition settlement in  as our business stabilized and returned to growth 
during the quarter ended september   we reorganized and merged operations of the broadcast and professional media divisions into one division named the broadcast and professional division 
the new divisions equate to two reportable segments broadcast and professional  and business and consumer 
the reorganization was performed to provide a structure that would allow better focus on our business and reduction of costs 
as part of this reorganization  we consolidated our worldwide accounting function and eliminated certain redundant positions  resulting in involuntary termination expenses of approximately million related to severance and associated costs related to employees that were terminated during the quarter ended september  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets acquisition related intangible assets result from our acquisitions of businesses accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and consist of the values of identifiable intangible assets including core developed technology  assembled work force  trade names  customer related intangibles  trademarks  favorable contracts as well as goodwill 
goodwill is the amount by which the cost of acquired identifiable net assets exceeded the fair values of those identifiable net assets on the date of purchase 
as of june   our goodwill and other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were million  compared to million as of june  acquisition related intangibles are being amortized using the straight line method over periods ranging from three to nine years 
the amortization increased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  this increase is primarily related to the amortization of approximately million of additional goodwill  which we recorded in april in connection with our buyout of the earnout payments otherwise payable to the former montage shareholders  the amortization resulting from the technology and products that we acquired from fast in october and the dvd authoring technology that we acquired from minerva networks  inc in december in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which we fully adopted on july  upon adoption  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized 
in addition  sfas no 
is effective with respect to business combinations in fiscal  and as a result  we no longer amortize goodwill for any acquisitions completed since the beginning of the fiscal year 
sfas no 
will require that we evaluate our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment 
we are currently evaluating whether or not the adoption of sfas no 
will require us to take an impairment charge upon adoption  and if so  the amount of the charge 
this evaluation is sensitive to a number of assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of each of our reporting units  and will reflect management s best estimates 
as of june   we had approximately million of net goodwill and other intangible assets 
although our impairment analysis is not yet complete  we believe we will likely report a goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of fiscal that may range up to million 
subsequent to our adoption of sfas no 
on july   we will evaluate  on an annual basis or whenever significant changes occur in our business  whether our goodwill and other intangible assets have been impaired 
if we determine that our goodwill and other intangible assets have been impaired  we will recognize an impairment charge 
acquisition settlement on september   we agreed to compensate certain former shareholders and option holders of avid sports  inc because of the drop in the market price of our common stock immediately after the acquisition 
if the closing price of our common stock did not equal or exceed per share for four consecutive trading days prior to may   the value of the compensation to be paid was to equal to the number of shares issued and options assumed in the acquisition  and  respectively multiplied by the difference between our average closing stock price during the month of may  and per share 
the former shareholders of avid sports  inc were to be compensated in shares of our common stock while the former option holders were to be compensated in cash 
on september   we recorded a charge of million  which represented the fair value of the arrangement on september   including million in transaction fees 
this charge included a liability of million which represented the estimated cash payout to the option holders with the remaining million  determined using the black scholes method  recorded as an increase in common stock 
our share price did not reach the target level and therefore  in june  we issued  additional shares of our common stock to the former shareholders of avid sports  inc  and paid an aggregate of million in cash to the former option holders of avid sports  inc the difference between the estimated cash payout to the former option holders of avid sports  inc at september  of million and the actual payment in june  was recorded as a reduction to lower the initial charge to the final expense of million 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net consists primarily of interest income generated from our investments in money market funds  government securities and high grade commercial paper 
interest income increased approximately to million in the fiscal year ended june   from million in the fiscal year ended june  this increase was primarily due to a higher invested balance  which was partially offset by a one time interest payment that we made in august to a certain customer in connection with the cancellation of a sales contract 
in addition  positive cash flows generated from our operations for the fiscal year ended june  obtained lower interest yields than investments made during the fiscal year ended june  income tax expense income taxes are comprised of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million and million for the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
we incurred a tax expense in the fiscal year ended june  primarily because of income from our international subsidiaries 
we incurred a tax expense in fiscal primarily because of the increase in our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
as of june   we have provided a valuation allowance for our net us deferred tax assets  as we are presently unable to conclude that all of the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized 
the total valuation allowance was million and million as of june  and  respectively 
as of june   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
our federal net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years through  if not utilized 
our state net operating loss expires in the years through  if not utilized 
in addition  we had federal research and experimentation credit carryforwards of million  which expire in the years through  and state research and experimentation credit carryforwards of million  which have no expiration provision 
comparison of the years ended june  and net sales net sales increased in all three divisions in the fiscal year ended june   compared to fiscal in the broadcast solutions division  sales increased during the year ended june  as compared to the prior year 
the increase in broadcast solutions sales was primarily due to the sale of sports products obtained through the acquisition of avid sports  inc and des  and increases in sales of the deko line  which more than offset declines in sales of existing products including a decline in sales of media stream servers 
in the professional media division  sales increased in the fiscal year ended june   compared to the fiscal year ended june  this increase was due mostly to sales of media s recent product releases that include the targa line  streamgenie  and streamfactory 
in the personal web video division  sales increased in the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  sales in the personal web video division increased due to the introduction and sale of studio dv  dv and dvplus  which more than offset declines in older products such as dc  dc and dc pro 
international sales sales outside of north america increased in the fiscal year ended june  and accounted for approximately and of our net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
as a percentage of our total net sales  international sales increased primarily due to increased sales in the asia pacific region 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our total net sales 
gross margins we distribute and sell our products to end users through the combination of independent domestic and international dealers  vars  retailers  distributors  oems and  to a lesser extent  a direct sales force 
sales to dealers  vars  retailers  distributors and oems are generally at a discount to the published list prices 
the amount of discount  and consequently  our gross margins  varies depending on the product  the channel of distribution  the volume of product purchased and other factors 
in addition to direct material costs  cost of sales consists primarily of costs related to the procurement of components and subassemblies  labor and overhead associated with procurement  assembly and testing of finished products  inventory management  warehousing  shipping  warranty costs  royalties and provisions for excess or obsolescence and shrinkage 
in the fiscal year ended june   total gross margins decreased to from in the fiscal year ended june  included in the cost of sales for the fiscal year ended june  was a million inventory charge  consisting of a million charge and a million charge in the first and fourth quarters  respectively  of the charges related to discontinued products and accessories primarily in the broadcast solutions and professional media divisions 
these inventory charges were part of reorganizations we implemented in each of the first and fourth quarters of fiscal  as described in more detail below and in general and administrative 
during the quarter ended september   we reorganized our internal reporting structure to facilitate better and more efficient reporting and to increase internal accountability 
in conjunction with this reorganization  we streamlined our product line offerings by discontinuing certain products  including primarily alladin and the g and g versions of the media stream servers  and by writing down excess targa and dvd inventory to its net realizable value 
this resulted in an inventory charge of million to reduce the inventory carrying value to its estimated net realizable value on the secondary parts market 
this inventory was subsequently sold on the secondary parts market for its approximate revised carrying amount 
as a result of this reorganization  we increased the effectiveness of our internal processes and streamlined our product offerings  which we expect will indirectly improve our operating results over time 
we do not expect the reorganization to have a significant direct effect on future earnings 
during the quarter ended june   we reorganized further and streamlined our operations into three distinct divisions the broadcast solutions division  the professional media division and the personal web video division 
each of these divisions was given full profit and loss responsibility 
as part of this reorganization  which was implemented to reduce operating losses in response to decreased sales  we reevaluated our product offerings and better aligned them within our distribution channels 
this reevaluation led to the discontinuance of certain products in an effort to simplify our manufacturing  sales and marketing processes and to more rapidly transition to newer product designs 
as a result  we recorded a million inventory charge to write down inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
the discontinued products primarily consisted of certain versions of our pctv  thunder  dc  dc  dv  dv and mp products 
to the extent any of this inventory that has been written down or written off is not scrapped or sold on the secondary parts market  we intend to disclose any material impact on gross margin 
it is difficult to assess how the discontinuation of these products will impact future sales and profitability 
however  we believe that the resulting simplified product lines will result in improved efficiencies in marketing  sales  and manufacturing 
excluding these inventory charges  gross margins would have been in the fiscal year ended june  this decrease in our margin was primarily due to a decrease in margins in the broadcast solutions and personal web video divisions 
excluding the million portion of the inventory charge that related to broadcast solutions products  broadcast solutions margins dropped to from in the fiscal year ended june  and  respectively 
the decrease in broadcast solutions margins was primarily due to lower selling prices in the media stream product family 
excluding the million portion of the inventory charge that related to professional media products  professional media margins were relatively unchanged in the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior year 
excluding the million portion of the inventory charge that related to personal web video products  personal web video margins dropped to from in the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
this decrease in personal web video margins was primarily due to reduced pricing on products aimed at the consumer market 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  pricing pressures on all of our products as the industry matures and competition increases 
engineering and product development engineering and product development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products and enhancements of existing products and consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  prototype and development expenses  depreciation and facility costs 
engineering and product development expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  this increase was due primarily to higher engineering and product development expenses as a result of acquiring puffin  des  montage  and avid sports  inc as a percentage of sales  engineering and product development expenses were in the fiscal year ended june  compared to in the fiscal year ended june   as a result of our efforts to focus more resources on developing new products 
we believe that investment in research and development is crucial to our future growth and position in the industry and expect to continue to allocate significant resources to all of our engineering and product development locations throughout the world 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses include compensation and benefits for sales and marketing personnel  commissions  travel  advertising and promotional expenses including channel marketing funds and trade shows  and professional fees for marketing services 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  this increase was due to the addition of sales and marketing expenses as a result of the acquisitions of puffin  des  montage  and avid sports  inc  along with increases in europe and the us these increases reflect expenditures to achieve our goal of increased sales and market share and expanded product awareness in new and existing markets throughout the world 
as a percentage of net sales  sales and marketing expenditures increased to in the fiscal year ended june  from in the fiscal year ended june  general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for administrative  executive  finance and management information systems personnel  legal and accounting costs  it infrastructure costs  bad debt expense  and other corporate administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  this increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the increased investment necessary to manage and support our increased scale of operations and the infrastructure related to our new business units 
other contributing factors were an increase in the bad debt provision and higher legal fees associated with the class action lawsuit filed against us in july see item legal proceedings 
this increase also includes reorganization costs of approximately million 
as discussed in gross margins  we completed reorganizations in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal during the quarter ended september   we reorganized our internal reporting structure by changing the organizational structure in order to facilitate better and more efficient internal reporting of the results of its business units 
this reorganization required a modest reduction in headcount due to the more efficient organizational structure  resulting in involuntary termination expenses of million  consisting primarily of severance for employees that were terminated during the quarter ended september  we believe this reorganization improved internal accountability

each of these divisions was given full profit and loss responsibility 
as part of this reorganization  which was implemented to reduce operating losses in response to decreased sales  we eliminated certain redundant positions  resulting in involuntary termination expenses of approximately million related to severance and associated costs related to employees that were terminated during the quarter 
as a result of this reorganization and a reduction in discretionary spending  we significantly decreased total operating expenses by approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  however  operating expenses increased during the fiscal year ended compared to the fiscal year ended as our business stabilized and returned to growth 
as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses were and in the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
amortization of acquisition related intangible assets amortization of acquisition related intangibles consists of amortization of goodwill and identifiable intangibles including  among others  core developed technology  customer related intangibles  trademarks  favorable contracts and assembled workforce 
these assets are being amortized using the straight line method over periods ranging from three to nine years 
the amortization increased from million in the fiscal year ended june  to million in the year ended june  the increase was primarily related to amortization of additional goodwill and other intangibles resulting from the six acquisitions we made during fiscal and the acquisition of dvd authoring technology from minerva during fiscal legal settlement during the third quarter of  we recorded a million charge for a legal settlement related to a lawsuit filed against us by hot key pty ltd  one of our former distributors  located in australia 
the complaint entitled hot key pty ltd 
vs 
pinnacle systems  inc  no 
c rmw was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california on may   and alleged causes of action for breach of contract  fraud and deceit  breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing  and breach of express warranty 
both parties agreed to use non binding mediation in an attempt to resolve the issue and reached an out of court settlement in march prior to the settlement  we did not believe any potential loss was estimable and therefore did not accrue or record any loss in our financial statements prior to that time 
acquisition settlement on september   we agreed to compensate the former shareholders and option holders of avid sports  inc because of the drop in the market price of our common stock immediately after the acquisition 
if the closing price of our common stock did not equal or exceed per share for four consecutive trading days prior to may   the value of the compensation to be paid was to equal to the number of shares issued and options assumed in the acquisition  and  respectively multiplied by the difference between our average closing stock price during the month of may  and per share 
the former shareholders of avid sports  inc were to be compensated in shares of our common stock while the former option holders were to be compensated in cash 
on september   we recorded a charge of million  which represented the fair value of the arrangement on september   including million in transaction fees 
this charge included a liability of million which represented the estimated cash payout to the option holders with the remaining million  determined using the black scholes method  recorded as an increase in common stock 
our share price did not reach the target level and therefore  in june  we issued  additional shares of our common stock to the former shareholders of avid sports  inc  and paid an aggregate of million in cash to the former option holders of avid sports  inc the difference between the estimated cash payout to the former option holders of avid sports  inc at september  of million and the actual payment in june  was recorded as a reduction to lower the initial charge to the final expense of million 
in process research and development during the fiscal year ended june   we did not incur in process research and development charges 
during the year ended june   we recorded in process research and development costs of approximately million  mostly related to the acquisitions of the video communications division from hp  and of puffin  des and montage 
the value assigned to purchased in process research and development was determined by estimating the cost to develop the purchased in process research and development into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects  discounting the net cash flows back to the time of acquisition using a risk adjusted discount rate and then applying an attribution rate based on the estimated percent complete considering the approximate stage of completion of the in process technology at the date of acquisition 
impairment of equity investments we recorded impairment losses on two equity investments of million during the fiscal year ended june  impairment losses are recognized on equity investments when we determine that there has been a decline in the carrying amount of the investment that is other than temporary 
the impairment charge relates to non marketable equity securities 
interest and other income  net net interest and other income consists primarily of interest income generated from our investments in money market funds  government securities and high grade commercial paper 
in the fiscal year ended june   interest income decreased approximately to million from million in the fiscal year ended june  this decrease reflects both a reduction in interest rates and a reduction in our cash and marketable securities balances 
income tax expense income taxes are comprised of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
we recorded provisions for income taxes of million and million for the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
we incurred a tax expense in the fiscal year ended primarily because of the increase in our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
the tax expense incurred in the fiscal year ended june  was offset by nondeductible in process research and development and goodwill amortization as a result of various acquisitions during the fiscal year ended june  the total valuation allowance was million and million as of june  and  respectively 
as of june   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
our federal net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years through  if not utilized 
our state net operating loss expires in the years through  if not utilized 
in addition  we had federal research and experimentation credit carryforwards of million  which expire in the years through  and state research and experimentation credit carryforwards of million  which have no expiration provision 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased million during the fiscal year ended june   compared to a decrease of million during the fiscal year ended june  cash and cash equivalents were million as of june   compared to million as of june  we have funded our operations to date through sales of equity securities as well as through cash flows from operations 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalent balances as well as anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to support our current operations and growth for the foreseeable future 
operating activities our operating activities generated cash of million during the fiscal year ended june   compared to consuming cash of million during the fiscal year ended june  cash generated from operations of million during the fiscal year ended june  was attributable to a significant decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in deferred revenues and accrued income taxes  which were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
as a result  we maintained positive cash flows from operations  despite incurring a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended june  the significant decrease in our accounts receivable was the result of more linear sales and more effective cash management and collections 
the increase in our deferred revenues was the result of receiving some advance payments on several large system sales  which we recorded as deferred revenue 
we cannot reasonably expect accounts receivable to continue to decrease at this rate and we expect that our accounts receivable may increase in the future 
cash used in operations of million during the fiscal year ended june  resulted from the net loss we incurred  in addition to an increase in inventory and a decrease of accounts payable 
investing activities our investing activities consumed cash of million during the fiscal year ended june   compared to generating cash of million during the fiscal year ended june  cash consumed from investing activities of million during the fiscal year ended june  was due to the purchase of marketable securities  a cash payment for the acquired technology and products from fast multimedia  and the purchase of property and equipment 
cash generated from investing activities of million during the year ended june  was primarily due to the maturity and sale of our investments in marketable securities  which was partially offset by cash payments for the acquisition of propel ahead  inc  the acquired dvd authoring technology from minerva networks  inc  and the purchase of property and equipment 
financing activities our financing activities generated cash of million during the fiscal year ended june   compared to generating cash of million during the fiscal year ended june  cash generated from financing activities of million during the fiscal year ended june  was due to the proceeds from the purchase of our common stock through the employee stock purchase plan  or espp  and the exercise of employee stock options 
cash generated from financing activities of million during the fiscal year ended june  was primarily due to the proceeds from the purchase of our common stock through the employee stock purchase plan  or espp  and the exercise of employee stock options  which was mostly offset by the repurchase of our stock on the open market 
stock option exchange program in november  we offered a voluntary stock option exchange program to certain eligible employees  which provided these employees with the opportunity to tender their existing stock options in exchange for an equal number of replacement options to be granted in june  with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date that the new options were granted 
these elections were required to be made by december   and were required to include all options granted to the electing employee during the prior six month period 
a total of employees elected to participate in the stock option exchange program 
of the  stock options that were eligible to be tendered   options  or  were tendered in december  on june   we granted an aggregate of  million replacement options to those employees who had been continuously employed by us from the date they tendered their options through the grant date 
only our employees who lived and worked in the united states  germany  japan or the united kingdom  and who were employed by us as of  or prior to  the commencement of the offer  were eligible to participate 
directors  executive officers and certain other officers were not eligible to participate in the stock option exchange program 
lease obligations we lease facilities and vehicles under non cancelable operating leases 
future minimum lease payments are as follows for the fiscal years ending june  in thousands thereafter total operating lease obligations the lease obligation disclosure  above  represents a five year period from july  through june  and any lease obligations thereafter 
rent expense for the years ended june   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
other contractual obligations our contractual obligations  other than operating leases  include purchase orders related to the procurement of materials that are required to produce our products for sale 
currently  we do not have any capital leases  long term debt  other long term obligations  or contractual cash obligations 
the most significant contractual financial obligations we have  other than specific balance sheet liabilities and facility leases  are the purchase order po s commitments we place with vendors and subcontractors to procure and guarantee a supply of the electronic components required to manufacture our products for sale 
we place po s with our vendors on an ongoing basis based on our internal sales forecasts 
the amount of outstanding po s can range from the value of material required to supply one half of the sales in a quarter to as much as the full amount needed for a quarter 
as of june   the amount of outstanding po s was approximately million 
the total amount of these commitments can vary from quarter to quarter based on a variety of factors  including but not limited to  the total amount of expected future sales  lead times in the electronic components markets  the mix of projected sales and the mix of components required for those sales 
most of these po s are firm commitments that cannot be cancelled  though some po s can be rescheduled without penalty and some can be completely canceled with little or no penalty 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we also have other key accounting policies that may not require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or subjective  such as our policies for revenue recognition and the deferral of revenues for large system sales and sales to distributors 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition  product returns  accounts receivable and bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the financial impact of these estimates and judgments is reviewed by management on an ongoing basis  and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to public release of our financial results 
management believes that these estimates are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies below as the policies most critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition sales returns and allowance for doubtful accounts valuation of intangible assets and goodwill valuation of inventory revenue recognition we derive our revenue primarily from the sale of products  including both hardware and software licenses and  to a lesser extent  from services and support revenue including software and hardware maintenance and training 
for many of our transactions  we apply the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition 
however  revenues from sales of software are recognized in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended and interpreted 
for systems sales that require significant customization and modification during installation to meet customer specifications  we apply the provisions of aicpa statement of position sop  contract accounting 
we define revenue recognition criteria as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
for all sales  we use either a binding purchase order or another form of documented agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales to most of our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
shipping terms generally are fob shipping point 
the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
at the time of a transaction  we assess whether the sale amount is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and its creditworthiness 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
except for large systems sales  our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  revenue is recognized upon acceptance  which occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or a certain event  such as on air that contractually constitutes acceptance 
for sales to distributors who have only limited return rights  revenue is generally recognized at the time of shipment and a sales return reserve is recorded to provide for estimated product returns 
for sales to distributors who have unlimited return rights  revenue is recognized when the product is sold through to their customer 
for products with telephone support and bug fixes bundled in as part of the original sale  revenue is recognized at the time of product shipment and the costs to provide telephone support and bug fixes are accrued as these costs are deemed insignificant 
our systems sales frequently involve multiple elements such as hardware product  installation  training  and maintenance 
for arrangements with multiple elements representing separate earnings processes  revenue is allocated to the various elements based upon the residual value method 
fair value of services such as installation or training is established based upon separate sales by us of these services to other customers  in accordance with sop  for software products or the quoted rates for such services by us or our competitors for non software products 
the amounts allocated to installation and training are recognized when the services are delivered 
fair values for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations are based upon separate sales of support contract renewals sold to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts 
the amounts allocated to maintenance and support are recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
for systems with complex installation processes that are considered essential to the functionality of the product for example  when the services can only be performed by us  product and installation revenue is deferred until completion of the installation 
revenue from extended support and maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
management is required to make and apply significant judgments and estimates in connection with the recognition of revenue 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management were to make different judgments or apply different estimates 
sales returns and allowance for doubtful accounts we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales return allowance 
we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  international situations such as currency devaluations  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make significant judgments and estimates in connection with establishing the sales returns in any accounting period and the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilized different estimates 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill we review our long lived assets  including goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important and which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business significant negative industry or economic trends significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period our market capitalization relative to net book value in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which we fully adopted on july  upon adoption  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized 
in addition  sfas no 
is effective with respect to business combinations in fiscal  and as a result  we no longer amortize goodwill for any acquisitions completed since the beginning of the fiscal year 
sfas no 
will require that we evaluate our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment 
we are currently evaluating whether or not the adoption of sfas no 
will require us to take an impairment charge upon adoption  and if so  the amount of the charge 
this evaluation is sensitive to a number of assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of each of our reporting units  and will reflect management s best estimates 
although our impairment analysis is not yet complete  we believe we will likely report a goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of fiscal that may range up to million 
subsequent to our adoption of sfas no 
on july   we will evaluate  on an annual basis or whenever significant changes occur in our business  whether our goodwill and other intangible assets have been impaired 
if we determine that our goodwill and other intangible assets have been impaired  we will recognize an impairment charge 
valuation of inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value 
inventory is purchased as a result of the monthly internal demand forecast that we produce  which drives the issuance of purchase orders with our suppliers 
we capitalize all labor and overhead costs associated with the manufacture of our products 
inventory is reviewed quarterly and written down to adjust for excess or obsolete material 
we identify excess material by comparing the internal demand forecasts  based on product sales forecasts  to current inventory levels 
inventory that is deemed to be excess is written down to its estimated resale value in the secondary material resale market or to zero if there is no resale value 
inventory is identified as obsolete if we discontinue the use of a specific inventory item 
inventory that is deemed to be obsolete is written down to its estimated resale value or to zero if it has no resale value 
active inventory is written down to its net realizable value if the sales price falls below our carrying value 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  therefore  the pooling of interests method of accounting is prohibited 
sfas no 
also requires that an intangible asset acquired in a business combination be recognized apart from goodwill if i the intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights or ii the acquired intangible asset is capable of being separated from the acquired enterprise  as defined in sfas no 
sfas no 
is effective for all business combinations completed after june  and accounted for as a purchase and for all business combinations initiated after june   as defined by accounting principles board opinion no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill not be amortized but be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level reporting unit at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as defined by sfas no 
a reporting unit is the same level as or one level below an operating segment  as defined by sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
identifiable intangible assets with an indefinite life  as defined in sfas no 
 will not be amortized until their life is determined to be finite 
all other identifiable intangible assets are required to be amortized over their useful life and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
goodwill is not tested for impairment under sfas no 
 but instead is tested for impairment as prescribed in sfas no 
for goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed prior to july   sfas no 
is effective for our fiscal year beginning on july   the date we are required to adopt sfas no 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination completed after june  are required to be accounted for in accordance with the amortization and nonamortization provisions of sfas no 
as of the date of adoption  july   we have unamortized goodwill in the amount of million  and unamortized identifiable intangible assets  all with definite lives  in the amount of million  both of which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas no 
and no 
amortization expense related to goodwill and identifiable intangible assets was million for the fiscal year ended june  we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas no 
may have on our financial position and results of operations 
although the impairment analysis as of the date of adoption is not yet complete  we believe we will likely report a goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of fiscal that may range up to million 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the asset 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  we will recognize a gain or loss on settlement 
the provisions of sfas no 
will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june   which will be our fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas no 
may have on our financial position and results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes both sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions in sfas no 
for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas no 
for example  sfas no 
provides guidance on how a long lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
sfas no 
retains the basic provisions of apb opinion no 
on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike sfas no 
 an impairment assessment under sfas no 
will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under sfas no 
the provisions of sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   which will be our fiscal year we do not expect the impact of adopting sfas no 
to be significant 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
this statement requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect the impact of adopting sfas to be significant 
factors that could affect future results there are various factors that may cause our future net revenues and operating results to fluctuate 
as a result  quarter to quarter variations could result in a substantial decrease in our stock price if our net revenues and operating results are below analysts expectations 
our net revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate because of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
these factors include adverse changes in general economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business  including the recent slow down affecting north america  europe  asia pacific and potentially other geographic areas the continuing adverse economic impact of the recent national tragedy on september  increased competition and pricing pressure the timing of significant orders from and shipments to major customers  including oem s and our large broadcast accounts the timing and market acceptance of new products and upgrade the timing of customer acceptance on large system sales our success in developing  marketing and shipping new products our dependence on the distribution channels through which our products are sold the accuracy of our and our resellers forecasts of end user demand the accuracy of inventory forecasts our ability to obtain sufficient supplies from our subcontractors on a timely basis the timing and level of consumer product returns foreign currency fluctuations delays and costs associated with the integration of acquired operations the introduction of new products by major competitors intellectual property infringement claims by or against us we also experience significant fluctuations in orders and sales due to seasonal fluctuations  the timing of major trade shows and the sale of consumer products in anticipation of the holiday season 
sales usually slow down during the summer months of july and august  especially in europe 
also  we attend a number of annual trade shows  which can influence the order pattern of products  including cebit in march  the nab convention in april and the ibc convention in september 
our operating expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations of future revenue 
such future revenue levels are difficult to forecast 
any shortfall in our quarterly net sales would have a disproportionate  negative impact on our quarterly net income 
the resulting quarter to quarter variations in our revenues and operating results could create uncertainty about the direction or progress of our business  which could cause our stock price to decline 
due to these factors  our future net revenues and operating results are not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
deteriorating market conditions and continued economic uncertainty could materially adversely impact our revenues and growth rate 
as a result of recent unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending  individuals and companies have delayed or reduced expenditures  as we experienced during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal although our sales increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal from the first  second and third quarters of fiscal  our revenue growth and profitability depend primarily on the overall demand for our products 
softening demand for these products resulting from ongoing economic uncertainty may result in decreased revenues  earnings levels or growth rates 
if united states or international economic conditions worsen  demand for our products may weaken  and our business  operating results  financial condition and stock price may be materially adversely affected as a result 
our revenues  particularly in the broadcast and professional division  are becoming increasingly dependent on large broadcast system sales to a few significant customers 
our business and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if sales are delayed or not completed within a given quarter or if any of our significant broadcast customers terminate their relationship or contracts with us  modify their requirements  which may delay installation and revenue recognition  or significantly reduce the amount of business they do with us 
we expect sales of large broadcast systems to a few significant customers to continue to constitute a material portion of our net revenues 
our quarterly and annual revenues could fluctuate significantly if sales to one or more of our significant customers are delayed or are not completed within a given quarter the contract terms preclude us from recognizing revenue during that quarter we are unable to provide any of our major customers with products in a timely manner and on competitive pricing terms any of our major customers experience competitive  operational or financial difficulties any of our major customers terminate their relationship with us or significantly reduce the amount of business they do with us any of our major customers reduce their capital investments in our products in response to slowing economic growth if we are unable to complete anticipated transactions within a given quarter  our revenues may fall below the expectations of market analysts  and our stock price could decline 
we incurred losses in fiscal and in fiscal and could generate losses in fiscal if the economy slows 
in fiscal and fiscal  we recorded net losses of approximately million and million  respectively 
although we do not currently envision incurring net losses  excluding the amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and any potential goodwill impairment charge  in fiscal  we could generate net losses in fiscal if the economy slows or if sales in our industry slow 
if we do continue to incur losses in fiscal  if our revenues decline or grow at a slower rate  or if our expenses increase without commensurate increases in revenues  our operating results will suffer and the price of our common stock may decline 
if we experience difficulty in the ongoing development and installation of our vortex news systems  our financial position and results of operations could be harmed 
in april  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of montage 
the montage product line includes vortex news  a networked news solution for broadcasters 
since the montage acquisition  we have invested significant resources and capital to further develop the vortex news products  and to integrate those products into our existing products 
we have received orders for our vortex news products from key customers and have proceeded with the initial installations 
we have successfully completed installation of the first few of those systems  but the systems are complex and are configured for each customer s needs 
if we experience difficulty in installing future vortex news systems or in adapting these systems to our customers needs  or if our customers are dissatisfied with the functionality or performance of our vortex news systems once they are installed  these systems may not obtain broad market acceptance or contribute meaningfully to our revenues or profitability 
in addition  if we do not successfully install  market and sell these systems  we will consume significant resources without obtaining commensurate revenues  and our financial position and results of operations will be harmed 
our goodwill and other intangible assets may become impaired  rendering their carrying amounts unrecoverable  and  as a result  we may be required to record a substantial impairment charge that would adversely affect our financial position 
as of june   we had approximately million of net goodwill and other intangible assets 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which we fully adopted on july  we are currently evaluating whether or not the adoption of sfas no 
will require us to take an impairment charge upon adoption  and if so  the amount of the charge 
this evaluation is sensitive to a number of assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of each of our reporting units  and will reflect management s best estimates 
as of june   we had approximately million of net goodwill and other intangible assets 
although our impairment analysis is not yet complete  we believe we will likely report a goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of fiscal that may range up to million 
subsequent to our adoption of sfas no 
on july   we will annually evaluate whether our goodwill and other intangible assets have been impaired 
the recent general economic slowdown has adversely affected demand for our products  increasing the likelihood that our goodwill and other intangible assets will become impaired 
if we determine that our goodwill and other intangible assets have been impaired  we will recognize an impairment charge that could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our stock price may be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has in the past  and could in the future  fluctuate significantly 
these fluctuations have been  or could be  in response to numerous factors  including quarterly variations in our results of operations announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our customers or competitors changes in securities analysts recommendations announcements of acquisitions changes in earnings estimates made by independent analysts general stock market fluctuations our revenues and results of operations may be below the expectations of public market securities analysts or investors 
this could result in a sharp decline in the market price of our common stock 
in july  we announced that financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal  which ended june   would be lower than the then current analyst consensus estimates regarding our quarterly results 
in the day following this announcement  our share price lost more than of its value 
our shares continue to trade in a price range significantly lower than the range held by our shares before this announcement 
with the advent of the internet  new avenues have been created for the dissemination of information 
we do not have control over the information that is distributed and discussed on electronic bulletin boards and investment chat rooms 
the motives of the people or organizations that distribute such information may not be in our best interest or in the interest of our shareholders 
this  in addition to other forms of investment information  including newsletters and research publications  could result in a sharp decline in the market price of our common stock 
in addition  stock markets have from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices for high technology companies have been particularly affected by these market fluctuations and such effects have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may cause a decline in the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s stock  securities class action litigation has been brought against the issuing company 
in july  a lawsuit entitled jiminez v 
pinnacle systems  inc et al  no 
cv was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california against us and certain of its officers and directors 
additional actions based on the same allegations were filed in the same court 
in october  all of the actions were consolidated under the name in re pinnacle systems  inc securities litigation  master file no 
c mmc  and lead plaintiffs and lead counsel were appointed 
the consolidated action is a putative class action alleging that defendants violated the federal securities laws by making false and misleading statements concerning our business during a putative class period of april  through july  plaintiffs seek unspecified damages 
plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint in december  and defendants thereafter moved to dismiss that complaint 
in a written order dated may   the court dismissed the consolidated amended complaint and permitted plaintiffs to file an amended complaint 
plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in june defendants thereafter moved to dismiss that complaint 
in a written order dated january   the court dismissed the second amended complaint and granted plaintiffs leave to amend 
on march   plaintiffs filed a third consolidated amended complaint  which defendants have moved to dismiss 
we are defending the case vigorously 
it is possible that additional similar litigation could be brought against us in the future 
the securities class action lawsuit described above and any similar litigation which may be brought against us could result in substantial costs and would likely divert management s attention and resources from the day to day operations of our business 
any adverse determination in such litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities 
if we do not compete effectively against other companies in our target markets  our business and results of operations will be harmed 
we compete in the broadcast  professional  business  and consumer video production markets 
each of these markets is highly competitive and diverse  and the technologies for our products can change rapidly 
the competitive nature of these markets results in pricing pressure and drives the need to incorporate product upgrades and accelerate the release of new products 
new products are introduced frequently and existing products are continually enhanced 
we anticipate increased competition in each of the broadcast  professional  business  and consumer video production markets  particularly since the industry continues to undergo a period of rapid technological change and consolidation 
competition for our broadcast  professional  business  and consumer video products is generally based on product performance breadth of product line quality of service and support market presence and brand awareness price ability of competitors to develop new  higher performance  lower cost consumer video products certain competitors in the broadcast  professional  business  and consumer video markets have larger financial  technical  marketing  sales and customer support resources  greater name recognition and larger installed customer bases than we do 
in addition  some competitors have established relationships with current and potential customers of ours  and offer a wide variety of video equipment that can be bundled in certain large system sales 
our principal competitors in the broadcast and professional markets include accom  inc avid technology chyron corporation leitch technology corporation matsushita electric industrial co 
ltd 
quantel ltd 
a division of carlton communications plc seachange corporation sony corporation thomson multimedia our principal competitors in the business and consumer markets are adobe systems  inc apple computer avid technology  inc dazzle multimedia a division of scm microsystems  inc hauppauge digital  inc matrox electronics systems  ltd 
media  inc roxio  inc sony corporation these lists are not all inclusive 
the consumer market in which certain of our products compete is highly competitive 
there are several established video companies that currently offer products or solutions that compete directly or indirectly with our consumer products by providing some or all of the same features and video editing capabilities 
we expect that existing manufacturers and new market entrants will develop new  higher performance  lower cost consumer video products that may compete directly with our consumer products 
in addition  existing and potential competitors may be able to adapt more readily to evolving technologies and customer demands 
we expect that potential competition in this market is likely to come from existing video editing companies  software application companies or new entrants into the market  many of which have the financial resources  marketing and technical ability to develop products for the consumer video market 
increased competition in the broadcast  professional  business  or consumer markets could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share 
if we cannot compete effectively in these markets by offering products that are comparable in functionality  ease of use and price to those of our competitors  our revenues will decrease and our operating results will be adversely affected 
because we sell products internationally  we are subject to additional risks 
sales of our products outside of north america represented approximately of net sales in the quarter ended june  and approximately of net sales in the quarter ended june  sales of our products outside of north america represented approximately of net sales in the year ended june  and approximately of net sales in the year ended june  we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales 
we make foreign currency denominated sales in many  primarily european  countries 
this exposes us to risks associated with currency exchange fluctuations 
we expect that in fiscal and beyond  a majority of our european sales will continue to be denominated in local foreign currency  including the euro 
we have developed natural hedges for some of this risk since most of the european operating expenses are also denominated in local currency 
however  where we sell our products in local currencies  we may be competitively unable to change our prices to reflect exchange rate fluctuations 
as of june   our cash and cash equivalents balance was approximately million  with approximately million located in the us and approximately million located at international locations 
our cash balance from international operations included various foreign currencies  primarily the euro  but also included the british pound and japanese yen 
our operational structure is such that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can impact and cause fluctuations in our cash balances 
in addition to foreign currency risks  our international sales and operations may also be subject to the following risks unexpected changes in regulatory requirements export license requirements restrictions on the export of critical technology political instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs difficulties in staffing and managing international operations potential insolvency of international dealers and difficulty in collecting accounts we are also subject to the risks of changing economic conditions in other countries around the world 
these risks may harm our future international sales and  consequently  our business 
if our products do not keep pace with the technological developments in the rapidly changing video production industry  our business may be materially adversely affected 
the video production industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies or the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable 
our future growth will depend  in part  upon our ability to introduce new features and increased functionality for our existing products  improve the performance of existing products  respond to our competitors new product offerings and adapt to new industry standards and requirements 
delays in the introduction or shipment of new or enhanced products  our inability to timely develop and introduce such new products  the failure of such products to gain significant market acceptance or problems associated with new product transitions could materially harm our business  particularly on a quarterly basis 
we are critically dependent on the successful introduction  market acceptance  manufacture and sale of new products that offer our customers additional features and enhanced performance at competitive prices 
once a new product is developed  we must rapidly commence volume production 
this process requires accurate forecasting of customer requirements and attainment of acceptable manufacturing costs 
the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires us to manage the transition from older  displaced products to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demand 
in addition  as is typical with any new product introduction  quality and reliability problems may arise 
any such problems could result in reduced bookings  manufacturing rework costs  delays in collecting accounts receivable  additional service warranty costs and limited market acceptance of the product 
quarter end discounting  resulting from customers delaying negotiations until quarter end in an effort to improve their ability to obtain more favorable pricing terms  may delay sales transactions and cause our quarterly revenues to fall below analysts expectations 
our sales have been relatively linear throughout the quarters in fiscal however  the increase in large systems sales and the expansion of our distribution channels could result in us recognizing a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month or weeks of a given quarter 
if certain sales cannot be closed during those last weeks  sales may be deferred until the following quarter 
this may cause our quarterly revenues to fall below analysts expectations 
we are dependent on contract manufacturers and single or limited source suppliers for our components 
if these manufacturers and suppliers do not meet our demand  either in volume or quality  our business and financial condition could be materially harmed 
we rely on subcontractors to manufacture our professional and consumer products and the major subassemblies of our broadcast products 
we and our manufacturing subcontractors are dependent upon single or limited source suppliers for a number of components and parts used in our products  including certain key integrated circuits 
our strategy to rely on subcontractors and single or limited source suppliers involves a number of significant risks  including loss of control over the manufacturing process potential absence of adequate manufacturing capacity potential delays in lead times unavailability of certain process technologies reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  quality and cost unexpected increases in component costs as a result of these risks  the financial stability of  and our continuing relationships with  our subcontractors and single or limited source suppliers are important to our success 
if any significant subcontractor or single or limited source supplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture these subassemblies or provide critical components in required volumes  we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign our products with different components 
additional sources may not be available and product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis 
this could materially harm our business 
any extended interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the products  subassemblies or components manufactured by third party subcontractors or suppliers could materially harm our business 
we must retain key employees to remain competitive 
if certain of our key employees leave or are no longer able to perform services for us  this could materially and adversely affect our business 
we believe that the efforts and abilities of our senior management and key technical personnel are very important to our continued success 
as a result  our success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified technical and managerial personnel 
we may not be able to retain our key technical and managerial employees or attract  assimilate and retain such other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel as are required in the future 
also  employees may leave our employ and subsequently compete against us  or contractors may perform services for competitors of ours 
if we are unable to retain key personnel  our business could be materially harmed 
any failure to successfully integrate the businesses we have acquired or which we acquire in the future could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
over the past three years  we have acquired a number of businesses and technologies and expect to continue to make acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 
in october  we acquired the business and substantially all of the assets  and assumed certain liabilities  of fast multimedia holdings inc and fast multimedia ag  based in munich  germany 
in december  we acquired dvd authoring technology from minerva 
in june  we acquired avid sports  inc and propel 
in april  we acquired montage 
in march  we acquired des and puffin 
in august  we acquired the video communications division of hp  and truevision  inc we may in the near or long term pursue additional acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies 
integrating acquired operations is a complex  time consuming and potentially expensive process 
all acquisitions involve risks that could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
these risks include distracting management from the day to day operations of our business costs  delays and inefficiencies associated with integrating acquired operations  products and personnel difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction difficulty in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies possible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of the integration of new businesses and management personnel potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities incurring debt and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets we may be adversely affected if we are subject to  or initiate  intellectual property litigation 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights involving technology companies 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce any patents issued to us  to protect our trade secrets  trademarks and other intellectual property rights owned by us  or to defend us against claimed infringement 
we are also exposed to litigation arising from disputes in the ordinary course of business 
this litigation may divert management s attention away from the operation of our business result in the loss of our proprietary rights subject us to significant liabilities force us to seek licenses from third parties prevent us from manufacturing or selling products any of these results could materially harm our business 
in the course of business  we have in the past received communications asserting that our products infringe patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
we investigated the factual basis of such communications and negotiated licenses where appropriate 
it is likely that  in the course of our business  we will receive similar communications in the future 
while it may be necessary or desirable in the future to obtain licenses relating to one or more of our products  or relating to current or future technologies  we may not be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
these disputes may not be settled on commercially reasonable terms and may result in long and costly litigation 
we may be unable to protect our proprietary information and procedures effectively 
we must protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our proprietary technology 
in addition  we generally enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our employees and oem customers and limit access to  and distribution of  our proprietary technology 
these steps may not adequately protect our proprietary information nor give us any competitive advantage 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property  or disclose such intellectual property or trade secrets 
additionally  policing the unauthorized use of our proprietary technology is costly and time consuming  and software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  our business could be materially harmed 
we rely on dealers  vars and oems to market  sell and distribute many of our products 
in turn  we depend heavily on the success of these resellers 
if these resellers are not successful in selling our products or if we are unsuccessful in opening up new distribution channels  our financial performance will be negatively affected 
a significant portion of our sales are sourced  developed and closed through dealers  vars and oems 
we believe that these resellers have a substantial influence on customer purchase decisions  especially purchase decisions by large enterprise customers 
these resellers may not effectively promote or market our products or may experience financial difficulties and even close operations 
in addition  our dealers and retailers are not contractually obligated to sell our products 
therefore  they may  at any time  refuse to promote or distribute our products 
also  since many of our distribution arrangements are non exclusive  our resellers may carry our competitors products and could discontinue our products in favor of our competitors products 
also  since these distribution channels exist between us and the actual market  we may not be able to accurately gauge current demand for products and anticipate demand for newly introduced products 
for example  dealers may place large initial orders for a new product based on their forecasted demand which may or may not materialize 
with respect to consumer products offerings  we have expanded our distribution network to include several consumer channels  including large distributors of products to computer software and hardware retailers  which in turn sell products to end users 
we also sell our consumer products directly to certain retailers 
our consumer product distribution network has exposed us to the following risks  some of which are out of our control we are obligated to provide price protection to such retailers and distributors and  while the agreements limit the conditions under which product can be returned to us  we may be faced with product returns or price protection obligations the distributors or retailers may not continue to stock and sell our consumer products retailers and distributors often carry competing products as a result of these risks  we could experience unforeseen variability in our revenues and operating results 
excess or obsolete inventory  and overdue or uncollectible accounts receivables  could weaken our cash flow  harm our financial condition and results of operations and cause our stock price to fall 
the downturn in the global economy contributed to a reduced demand for some of our products earlier in fiscal if the economy experiences a double dip recession or if our industry experiences a decline during fiscal or beyond  we may experience increased exposure to excess and obsolete inventories and higher overdue and uncollectible accounts receivables 
if we fail to properly manage these inventory and accounts receivables risks  our cash flow may be weakened  and our financial position and results of operations could be harmed as a result 
this  in turn  may cause our stock price to fall

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currencies we transact business in various foreign currencies  primarily the euro  but also the british pound and japanese yen 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we use a natural hedge approach  since local currency revenues substantially offset the local currency denominated operating expenses 
we continually assess the need to use financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exposure 
fixed income investments our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio of marketable securities 
we generally do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we invest primarily in united states treasury notes and high grade commercial paper and generally hold them to maturity 
consequently  we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk 
we do  however  limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and strictly monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios 
at the present time  the maximum duration of all portfolios is one year 
our guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one issue as well as the type of instruments 
due to the limited duration and credit risk criteria established in our guidelines  we do not expect that our exposure to market and credit risk will be material
