overview we are a leading provider of thin film deposition equipment to the flat panel display  the architectural  automotive and solar glass  and the consumer products packaging and electronics industries 
we have also developed a barrier coating solution technology for the plastic beverage bottle industry 
our deposition systems deposit thin films that enhance the characteristics of a base substrate  such as glass  plastic  paper or foil 
these thin films provide conductive  electronic  reflective  filter  barrier and other properties that are critical elements of our customers products 
our thin film deposition systems provide our customers with high yield and throughput  flexible modular configurations  and innovative coating and process technologies 
we also process and sell thin film coated glass to the flat panel display  or fpd  industry 
our operations and financial position have been significantly affected by two corporate transactions that were implemented to advance our strategic transition from lower gross profit margin sales of coated glass to higher gross profit margin sales of thin film deposition equipment 
in  we entered into a joint venture the joint venture or china jv  with nippon sheet glass co  ltd 
to supply the low and high resolution coated glass market from a production base in suzhou  china 
the china jv began operations in april of in december  we completed the acquisition of the large area coatings  or lac  division of unaxis holding ag  or unaxis  which reported revenues of approximately million for the twelve months ended december  the lac acquisition expanded our product offering for the fpd industry 
the lac acquisition also enabled our entry into three new product markets architectural  automotive and solar glass  consumer products packaging and electronics and polyethylene terephthalate  or pet  plastic bottles 
we formed the china jv in order to produce coated glass at lower cost and in closer proximity to our source of raw glass and to our largely asian customer base 
we buy coated glass manufactured by the china jv and resell it to our customers in asia 
while our sales of coated glass products appear as revenues on our consolidated financial statements  because of the ownership structure of the china jv  the revenues and expenses of the china jv itself are not consolidated and do not appear as revenues and expenses in our financial statements 
the benefit of the lower cost structure of the china jv is captured in the net income of the china jv  of which appears as equity earnings of joint venture in our consolidated statements of operations 
the following table sets forth our net revenues net of returns and allowances by our major product categories and industry segments for the last three fiscal years in thousands fiscal year ended july  june  june thin film coated glass   thin film coating equipment   total net revenues   the following table sets forth our net revenues as a percentage of total revenues by our major product categories and industry segments for the last three fiscal years fiscal year ended july  june  jun e  thin film coated glass thin film coating equipment total net revenues revenues for thin film coating equipment are generally recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of the total costs incurred in relation to the estimated total costs to be incurred for each contract 
coated glass revenues and related costs are recognized when products are shipped to the customer 
the sales cycle for thin film coating equipment is long  involving multiple visits to and by the customer and up to months of technical sales effort 
we operate with a backlog of new and in process equipment orders 
coating equipment backlog was million at the end of fiscal and million at the end of fiscal the decline in backlog was caused by a weakness in bookings in the fpd and architectural glass portions of our equipment business in fiscal backlog is comprised of revenue not yet recognized from deposition equipment contacts denominated in us dollars  japanese yen and euros  and  unless hedged  is subject to fluctuation depending on changes in the valuation of the foreign currencies against the dollar 
customers usually make a non refundable deposit ranging from to of the total purchase price at the time the order is placed and make progress payments during the period of manufacture 
we usually receive approximately of the purchase price in cash or letter of credit prior to shipment 
we generally ship our thin film coated glass within days of receipt of the order and therefore we do not customarily have a backlog of coated glass sales 
in fiscal  of our revenues were generated from exports to customers outside of our manufacturing center in the united states  compared to of revenues from exports to customers outside of our manufacturing centers in the united states and europe for fiscal we sell most of our glass and equipment products to customers in the local currency of the location of manufacture 
accordingly  sales of products manufactured in longmont  colorado or purchased from the china jv for resale to our customers are generally denominated in us dollars and sales of products manufactured in germany are generally denominated in euros  except in each case for sales of glass to certain japanese customers  which are denominated in japanese yen 
the us dollar equivalent of gross revenues in japanese yen and euros were approximately million and million  respectively  for fiscal and million and million  respectively  for fiscal currently  we engage in international currency hedging transactions to mitigate our foreign exchange exposure related to sales of certain equipment  and the effects of foreign exchange rate changes on foreign currency transactions have not been significant to date 
we also purchase raw glass from certain japanese suppliers in transactions denominated in yen  which partially offsets foreign currency exchange risks on yen denominated coated glass sales 
the us dollar equivalent of our purchases of raw material denominated in japanese yen were approximately million for fiscal and  for fiscal as of june   the us dollar equivalent of accounts receivable denominated in japanese yen and euros were approximately million and million  or approximately and respectively  of total accounts receivable 
as of june   the us dollar equivalent of accounts payable denominated in japanese yen and euros were approximately  and million  or approximately and respectively  of total accounts payable 
we are generally paid by customers for japanese yen denominated coated glass sales within to days following the date of sale 
results of operations the following table sets forth information derived from the consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended july  june  june  consolidated statement of operations data net revenues cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets operating loss interest income expense other income  net equity earnings of joint venture income loss before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax benefit income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of taxes net income loss year ended june  compared to year ended june  net revenues 
net revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of a full year reporting of combined company results following the lac acquisition 
our revenue concentration continued to shift to the equipment segment of our business as our revenues generated by equipment sales increased from of total net revenues in fiscal to in fiscal net revenues from thin film coating equipment increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due primarily to a full year reporting of combined company results following the lac acquisition 
however  equipment backlog declined from million at the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal primarily due to a weakness in bookings for new orders in the architectural and fpd portions of the equipment business during fiscal thin film coated glass revenues decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this reduction resulted from lower prices which reduced our gross margins  and reduced demand for glass used in cellular phones  touch panels  and the microdisplay market 
gross profit 
gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  largely driven by the increased revenues from the equipment segment of our business as we reported a full year of combined company operations following the lac acquisition 
gross profit margins were in fiscal and in fiscal equipment revenues generally have higher gross profit margins than coated glass revenues 
gross margins were negatively affected during the year by sales of certain coated glass inventory at a market price that had moved below cost 
additionally we experienced a cost overrun on a transport system for an architectural glass equipment customer 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase represents a full year of combined company results following the lac acquisition 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal and in fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase represents a full year of operations of the combined company following the lac acquisition 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  outside contractor expenses  lab expenses  and other expenses related to our ongoing product development and technology development for oled  solar  pet bottle process development and other research and development activities 
as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenses were in fiscal and in fiscal amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in fiscal year  amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the lac acquisition included an million write off of in process research and development  million related to goodwill and million related to intangible assets 
following the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on july   goodwill and certain other intangible assets related to assembled workforce are no longer being amortized 
in fiscal year  amortization of other intangible assets was million 
interest income 
interest income was million in fiscal and  in fiscal because we principally used available cash and bank borrowings to fund the lac acquisition  interest income in the first half of fiscal changed to interest expense in the second half of fiscal  as we incurred interest expense under our credit facility 
the use of our bank line of credit continued until the second quarter of fiscal when we raised additional cash  through an offering of common stock  and we reduced our borrowings 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we invested the cash reserves and returned to interest income 
at the end of fiscal our average investment yield was compared to at the end of fiscal other income 
other income increased from  in fiscal to million in fiscal other income includes items such as realized foreign currency transaction adjustments and royalties earned from the china jv 
we receive a royalty on all sales by the china jv  payable quarterly 
much of the increase in fiscal was due to  for the reversal of excess reserves set aside for the completion of the required building reconditioning cost for the facility in alzenau to house all manufacturing operations in a single location and  for the recognition of a non refundable advance payment from a customer who went bankrupt which was previously recorded as a liability on our balance sheet 
equity earnings of joint venture 
our equity earnings of the china jv decreased from million in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease in equity earnings is primarily due to the weakness in the market for cellular phones as excess handset inventories have reduced the demand for coated glass 
income tax benefit 
we recorded a tax benefit during fiscal of  the income tax benefit for was reduced by approximately million due to the establishment of a valuation allowance on net operating loss 
the income tax benefit for fiscal of million  reflects the tax effect of goodwill and other intangible assets  tax free investment and interest income  and equity earnings of the joint venture will be reinvested in the joint venture 
for german tax purposes  the amount reported as goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet and the amount of in process research and development that was charged to expense  will be amortized over years and will be deductible as amortized 
year ended july  compared to year ended june  net revenues 
net revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of the lac acquisition 
net revenues from thin film coating equipment increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due primarily to the lac acquisition 
in the second half of fiscal  over of our revenues was generated from equipment  compared with approximately for the second half of fiscal  when revenues from the sale of the atx systems began to be recognized 
during fiscal and early fiscal  we sold three atx systems and recognized revenue on a percentage of completion basis on two of those systems in the second half of fiscal  with the remainder in the first quarter of fiscal thin film coated glass revenues decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this reduction was caused by reduced demand for super twisted nematic  or stn  glass used in cellular phones due to excess inventory of handsets 
in addition  during fiscal  we shifted production capacity for manufacturing coated glass to the china jv by selling a coating machine previously used in our longmont  colorado  facility to the china jv  shifting revenues to the china jv and reducing our coated glass revenues 
gross profit 
gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  largely driven by the shift in product mix from glass to equipment revenues and the increased revenues resulting from the lac acquisition 
gross profit margins were in fiscal and in fiscal equipment revenues generally have higher gross profit margins than coated glass revenues 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the substantial increase in fiscal resulted largely from the additional administrative  sales and marketing personnel from the lac acquisition 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal and in fiscal while we expect some synergies in the combination of marketing forces  we project selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues to remain at levels similar to those we experienced in the second half of fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  outside contractor expenses  lab expenses  and other expenses related to our ongoing product development efforts 
the increase in research and development expenses resulted largely from the additional staff and research and development operations in germany 
as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenses were in fiscal and in fiscal because of the significant product development opportunities  particularly in the pet bottle  oled and solar markets  we expect research and development expenses as a percent of net revenues for fiscal to remain at levels similar to those we experienced in the second half of fiscal amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in fiscal  amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was million consisting of million of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets and an million write off of in process research and development purchased in the lac acquisition 
we had no amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets in fiscal interest income 
interest income was  in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in interest income was generated from investment of the remaining proceeds of our million common stock offering completed in march other income 
other income increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal other income includes items such as realized foreign currency transaction adjustments and royalties earned from the china jv 
we receive a royalty on all sales by the china jv  payable quarterly 
equity earnings of joint venture 
our equity earnings of the china jv was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase results from the transition of manufacturing capacity to the china jv 
income tax benefit 
we recorded a tax benefit during fiscal of million 
the tax benefit reflects the tax effect of goodwill and other intangible assets  tax free investment and interest income  and equity earnings of the joint venture that is not subject to taxation 
for german tax purposes  the amount reported as goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet and the amount of in process research and development that was charged to expense  will be fully amortized over years and will be fully deductible as amortized 
the income tax benefit for fiscal was  representing an effective tax rate of negative 
this benefit was primarily derived from the reversal in fiscal of the income tax accrual in fiscal on the equity income from the china jv due to the determination that the earnings would not be distributed for the foreseeable future 
other factors contributing to the relatively low effective tax rate in fiscal were tax free investment and interest income and current year equity earnings of the china jv that are not subject to tax 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth summary unaudited quarterly financial information for the eight fiscal quarters ended june  in the opinion of management  such information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report and reflects all necessary adjustments consisting of only normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period and any trends reflected in such results may not continue in the future 
our results of operations may be subject to significant quarterly variations

the volume of equipment sales is significantly dependent on our customers capital spending patterns 
prior to the lac acquisition on december   our coated glass products were used primarily in calculators  cell phones and personal digital assistants  and our equipment products were used primarily in plasma televisions 
certain of these industries have experienced fluctuations  both in increased and decreased demand  as a result of general market conditions 
with the lac acquisition  we now are selling products into a wider variety of geographic and product markets that may be sensitive to different market forces 
we acquired the lac business in the third quarter of fiscal at the time of the acquisition  we wrote off million of purchased in process research and development  and in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal amortized a portion of the goodwill and other intangible assets from the lac acquisition 
during fiscal  following the adoption of fasb  we continued to amortize only the intangible assets related to the lac acquisition 
because we principally used available cash and bank borrowings to fund the lac acquisition  interest income in the first half of fiscal changed to interest expense in the second half of fiscal  as we incurred interest expense under our credit facility 
the use of our bank line of credit continued until the second quarter of fiscal when we raised additional cash  through an offering of common stock  and we reduced our borrowings 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we invested the cash reserves and returned to interest income 
from the second half of fiscal and through all of fiscal  cell phone manufacturers experienced a surplus inventory of handsets and reduced their demand for stn coated glass causing our china jv s earnings to fall dramatically and reducing revenues and margins for glass sold through our longmont operations 
this industry downturn negatively affected gross margins on coated glass produced in longmont and earnings of the china jv for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal and throughout fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
during preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  fixed assets  intangible assets  income taxes  pension benefits and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we recognize revenues on a majority of contracts relating to the construction and sale of thin film coating equipment using the percentage of completion method in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
pursuant to sop  revenues are measured by the percentage of the total costs incurred and applied to date in relation to the estimated total costs to be incurred for each contract 
management considers costs incurred and applied to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance 
general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
changes in performance  contract conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements  may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
the company generally offers warranty coverage for equipment sales for a period ranging from to months after final installation is complete 
the company estimates the anticipated costs to be incurred during the warranty period and accrues a reserve as a percentage of revenue as revenue is recognized 
these reserves are evaluated periodically based on actual experience and anticipated activity and are adjusted if necessary 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer s financial condition  credit history  and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with the temporary differences that have resulted from the differing treatment of items dictated by gaap versus us tax laws 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we were to believe that the recovery were less likely  we would establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset and charge the amount as an income tax expense in the period in which such a determination were made 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations with cash generated from operations  proceeds from public offerings of our common stock  a private offering of preferred stock and bank borrowings 
cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal compared to cash used by operating activities of million for fiscal during fiscal year  the company purchased marketable securities of million 
cash from operations primarily decreased as a result of a decline in operating results 
as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  marketable securities of million and working capital of million 
the total consideration for the lac acquisition was million including  shares of our common stock  million in cash and transaction costs of million 
the purchase price of the lac acquisition was financed through available cash  bank borrowings and the issuance of million of preferred stock 
the million of preferred stock accrued dividends at a blended rate of and dividends were paid quarterly at a rate until october   when the rate increased to 
dividends were paid in cash 
during december  the preferred stock was converted into  shares of common stock 
purchasers of preferred stock and their agent also received warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share 
in addition  our placement agent received warrants to purchase  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share 
as of june   the warrants remain outstanding 
our million credit facility with a commercial bank will expire on september  as of june   we had million outstanding in a letter of credit  compared with million outstanding in both borrowing and a letter of credit on june  on june   approximately million outstanding under this facility was a letter of credit representing our guarantee of the debt of the china jv  which increased to million as of june  we are required under the terms of the china jv to provide credit support on a several basis for of the china jv s bank indebtedness 
the china jv currently has a million revolving credit facility with sumitomo bank  for which we must provide a secured guarantee covering million 
the present level of borrowing represents the use of of the available credit under our facility 
the company pays an annual fee of approximately for the letter of credit 
the credit facility generally restricts our ability to make capital expenditures  incur additional indebtedness  enter into capital leases or guarantee obligations 
to remain in compliance with the credit agreement  we must also maintain certain financial ratios 
we intend to let this facility expire and establish a credit facility that will encompass the joint venture debt guarantee in the future 
we have currently arranged to provide our guarantee once our line of credit expires  for the debt at the joint venture using a german bank 
we will use cash as the collateral supporting a million bank guarantee until an adequate credit facility is in place 
capital expenditures were million for fiscal and million for fiscal we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal our capital expenditures have consisted primarily of purchases related to product development 
cash used by investing activities was million in fiscal for the lac acquisition and million in fiscal we believe that our working capital and operating needs will continue to be met by cash from operations  and proceeds from the offering  which closed in november our capital requirements depend on a number of factors  including the amount and timing of orders we receive  the timing of payments received from customers  and capital requirements associated with new product introductions 
if we require additional capital  we may consider various alternatives such as additional bank financing or the public or private sale of debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such funds on satisfactory terms if and when such funds are needed 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company has the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of june  in thousands 
payments due by perio d less than after contractual cash obligations total year years years years operating leases buildings    office equipment other capital lease office equipment 
amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts less than other commercial commitments committed year yea rs over years letter of credit   bank guarantees   other commercial commitments  total commercial commitments   the fair value of contracts outstanding as of june  is as follows in thousands fair value of contracts at period end maturity less maturity maturity in total fair source of fair value than year years excess of years value prices actively quoted  the operating leases primarily include leases for offices  factories and office equipment throughout our operations 
the letter of credit represents our guarantee of percent of the china jv s outstanding debt as of june   which was covered by our million credit facility with a commercial bank 
the letter of credit is the only obligation against the million credit facility at june  our other commercial commitments consist of software licenses and third party service contracts 
the bank guarantees are required by our customers primarily in china ensuring the progress payments made to the company and are terminated when the contract terms are fulfilled

sfas nos 
and establish a new method of testing goodwill for impairment and require that goodwill be separately tested for impairment using a fair value based approach 
the provisions apply not only to goodwill arising from acquisitions completed after june  but also to the unamortized balance of goodwill at the date of adoption 
we adopted the standard early  effective july  we completed our first impairment test in fiscal and the value of the goodwill exceeded the book value of the asset on our balance sheet 
therefore no impairment necessary 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exposure market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we generally place our investments with high credit quality issuers and by policy are averse to principal loss and seek to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
as of june   our investment consisted primarily of equity securities  corporate  government and municipal bonds and money market mutual funds of million  and earned approximately  for the fiscal year  at an average interest rate of approximately 
the impact on interest income of a decrease of one percent in the average interest rate would have resulted in approximately  less interest income for the fiscal year ended june  foreign exchange exposure we are exposed to foreign exchange risk associated with accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies 
at june   we had approximately million of accounts receivable and approximately  of accounts payable denominated in japanese yen 
a one percent change in exchange rates would result in an approximate  net impact on pre tax income based on the foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and accounts payable balances at june  at june   we had approximately million of accounts receivable and approximately million of accounts payable denominated in euros 
a one percent change in exchange rates would result in an approximate  net impact on pre tax income based on the foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and accounts payable balances at june  sales of products manufactured in germany are denominated in euros  except for sales of equipment to certain japanese customers  which are denominated in japanese yen 
currently  we engage in international currency hedging transactions to mitigate our foreign exchange exposure related to sales of certain equipment  and the effects of foreign exchange rate changes on foreign currency transactions have not been significant to date 
notwithstanding the above  actual changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition 
the potential impact depends upon the magnitude of the rate change 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates primarily in our cash balance  foreign currency transactions and the operating results of our foreign affiliates 
international manufacturing operations are primarily based in germany and constitute a significant portion of our revenues and identifiable assets 
most of these identifiable assets are based in euros 
international operations result in a large volume of foreign currency commitment and transaction exposures and significant foreign currency net asset exposures 
our cash position includes amounts denominated in foreign currencies primarily euros 
the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our affiliates could have adverse consequences to the statement of operations as well as tax consequences 
however  those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations 
effective january   eleven of fifteen member countries of the european union established permanent rates of exchange between the members national currencies and a new common currency  the euro 
in this first phase  the euro is available for non cash transactions in the monetary  capital  foreign exchange and interbank markets 
national currencies will continue to exist as legal tender and may continue to be used in commercial transactions until the euro currency is issued in january and the participating members national currencies are withdrawn by july our european operations are located in germany  which is participating  in this monetary union 
effective october  we converted our european operations from german marks to the euro 
any costs associated with the introduction of the euro were expensed as incurred
