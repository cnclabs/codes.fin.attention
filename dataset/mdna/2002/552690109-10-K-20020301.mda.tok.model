system supply and system demand through an interconnected electric system  montana dakota serves markets in portions of the following states and major communities western north dakota  including bismarck  dickinson and williston  eastern montana  including glendive and miles city  and northern south dakota  including mobridge 
the interconnected system consists of seven on line electric generating stations which have an aggregate turbine nameplate rating attributable to montana dakota s interest of  kilowatts kw and a total summer net capability of  kw 
montana dakota s four principal generating stations are steam turbine generating units using coal for fuel 
the nameplate rating for montana dakota s ownership interest in these four stations including interests in the big stone station and the coyote station aggregating percent and percent  respectively is  kw 
the balance of montana dakota s interconnected system electric generating capability is supplied by three combustion turbine peaking stations 
additionally  montana dakota has contracted to purchase through october    kw of participation power annually from basin electric power cooperative for its interconnected system

station use  to meet mid continent area power pool s accreditation requirements  exceeded generation 
virtually all of the current fuel requirements of the coyote  heskett and lewis clark stations are met with coal supplied by westmoreland coal company westmoreland 
contracts with westmoreland for the coyote  heskett and lewis clark stations expire in may  december  and december  respectively 
the majority of the big stone station s fuel requirements are currently being met with coal supplied by rag coal west  inc under contract through december  during the years ended december   through december   the average cost of coal purchased  including freight  per million british thermal units btu at montana dakota s electric generating stations including the big stone and coyote stations in the interconnected system and the average cost per ton  including freight  of the coal purchased was as follows years ended december  average cost of coal per million btu 




average cost of coal per ton the maximum electric peak demand experienced to date attributable to sales to retail customers on the interconnected system was  kw in august montana dakota s latest forecast for its interconnected system indicates that its annual peak will continue to occur during the summer and the peak demand growth rate through will approximate percent annually 
montana dakota s latest forecast indicates that its kilowatt hour kwh sales growth rate  on a normalized basis  through will approximate percent annually 
montana dakota currently estimates that  with modifications already made and those expected to be made  it has adequate capacity available through existing generating stations and long term firm purchase contracts until the year if additional capacity is needed in or after  it is expected to be met through the addition of a megawatt gas turbine power plant and intermediate term purchases 
in addition  the company and westmoreland power  inc are working with the state of north dakota to determine the feasibility of constructing a megawatt lignite fired power plant in western north dakota 
montana dakota has major interconnections with its neighboring utilities  all of which are mid continent area power pool members 
montana dakota considers these interconnections adequate for coordinated planning  emergency assistance  exchange of capacity and energy and power supply reliability 
through a separate electric system sheridan system  montana dakota serves sheridan  wyoming and neighboring communities 
the maximum peak demand experienced to date and attributable to montana dakota sales to retail consumers on that system was approximately  kw and occurred in august the sheridan system is supplied through an interconnection with black hills power and light company under a power supply contract through december  which allows for the purchase of up to  kw of capacity annually 
regulation and competition the electric utility industry can be expected to continue to become increasingly competitive due to a variety of regulatory  economic and technological changes 
the ferc  in its order no 
 has required that utilities provide open access and comparable transmission service to third parties 
in addition  as a result of competition in electric generation  wholesale power markets have become increasingly competitive and evaluations are ongoing concerning retail competition 
montana dakota joined the midwest independent transmission system operator  inc  midwest iso on september  the midwest iso  which the ferc accepted as a regional transmission organization rto under ferc order no 
in an order issued december   will be responsible for operational control of the transmission systems of its members 
thereafter  on december   montana dakota filed an application with the ferc for authorization to transfer operational control over certain of its transmission facilities to the midwest iso  and  by order dated january   the ferc authorized the transfer 
on december   the midwest iso filed a proposed modification to the midwest iso agreement to allow montana dakota to be a separate pricing zone 
the midwest iso commenced security center operations on december  and tariff administration on february  the montana legislature passed an electric industry restructuring bill  effective may  the bill provided for full customer choice of electric supplier by july   stranded cost recovery and other provisions 
based on the provisions of such restructuring bill  because montana dakota operates in more than one state  the company had the option of deferring its transition to full customer choice until legislation was passed in montana on march  which delays the restructuring and transition to full customer choice until a time that montana dakota can reasonably implement customer choice in the state of its primary service territory 
in its legislative session  the north dakota legislature established an electric industry competition committee to study over a six year period the impact of competition on the generation  transmission and distribution of electric energy in north dakota 
to date  the committee has made no recommendation regarding restructuring 
in  the wypsc selected a consultant to perform a study on the impact of electric restructuring in wyoming 
the study found no material economic benefits 
no further action is pending at this time 
the sdpuc has not initiated any proceedings to date concerning retail competition or electric industry restructuring 
federal legislation addressing this issue continues to be discussed 
although montana dakota is unable to predict the outcome of such regulatory proceedings or legislation  or the extent to which retail competition may occur  montana dakota is continuing to take steps to effectively operate in an increasingly competitive environment 
for additional information regarding retail competition  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the ndpsc has authorized its staff to initiate an investigation into the earnings levels of montana dakota s north dakota electric operations based on montana dakota s annual report to the ndpsc

fuel adjustment clauses contained in north dakota and south dakota jurisdictional electric rate schedules allow montana dakota to reflect increases or decreases in fuel and purchased power costs excluding demand charges on a timely basis 
expedited rate filing procedures in wyoming allow montana dakota to timely reflect increases or decreases in fuel and purchased power costs 
in montana percent of electric revenues  such cost changes are includible in general rate filings 
environmental matters montana dakota s electric operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations providing for air  water and solid waste pollution control  state facility siting regulations  zoning and planning regulations of certain state and local authorities  federal health and safety regulations and state hazard communication standards 
montana dakota believes it is in substantial compliance with those regulations 
governmental regulations establishing environmental protection standards are continuously evolving and  therefore  the character  scope  cost and availability of the measures which will permit compliance with these laws or regulations  cannot be accurately predicted 
montana dakota did not incur any significant environmental expenditures in and does not expect to incur any significant capital expenditures related to environmental compliance through natural gas distribution general montana dakota sells natural gas at retail  serving over  residential  commercial and industrial customers located in communities and adjacent rural areas as of december   and provides natural gas transportation services to certain customers on its system

the natural gas distribution operations of great plains are subject to regulation by the ndpsc and minnesota public utilities commission regarding retail rates  service and accounting 
the percentage of montana dakota s and great plains natural gas utility operating revenues by jurisdiction is as follows north dakota percent  minnesota percent  montana percent  south dakota percent and wyoming percent 
system supply  system demand and competition montana dakota and great plains serve retail natural gas markets  consisting principally of residential and firm commercial space and water heating users  in portions of the following states and major communities north dakota  including bismarck  dickinson  wahpeton  williston  minot and jamestown  western minnesota  including fergus falls  marshall and crookston  eastern montana  including billings  glendive and miles city  western and north central south dakota  including rapid city  pierre and mobridge  and northern wyoming  including sheridan 
these markets are highly seasonal and sales volumes depend on the weather 
the following table reflects this segment s natural gas sales  natural gas transportation volumes and degree days as a percentage of normal during the last five years years ended december  mdk thousands of decatherms sales residential      commercial      industrial   total      transportation commercial      industrial      total      total throughput      degree days of normal includes great plains sales and transportation volumes for great plains are for the period july through december degree days exclude great plains 
competition in varying degrees exists between natural gas and other fuels and forms of energy 
montana dakota and great plains have established various natural gas transportation service rates for their distribution businesses to retain interruptible commercial and industrial load 
certain of these services include transportation under flexible rate schedules whereby montana dakota s and great plains interruptible customers can avail themselves of the advantages of open access transportation on regional transmission pipelines  including the system of williston basin interstate pipeline company williston basin  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of wbi holdings 
these services have enhanced montana dakota s and great plains competitive posture with alternate fuels  although certain of montana dakota s customers have bypassed the respective distribution systems by directly accessing transmission pipelines located within close proximity  which did not have a material effect on results of operations 
montana dakota and great plains acquire their system requirements directly from producers  processors and marketers 
such natural gas is supplied by a portfolio of contracts specifying market based pricing  and is transported under transportation agreements by williston basin  northern gas company  south dakota intrastate pipeline company  northern border pipeline company  viking gas transmission company and northern natural gas company to provide firm service to their customers 
montana dakota has also contracted with williston basin to provide firm storage services which enable montana dakota to meet winter peak requirements as well as allow it to better manage its natural gas costs by purchasing natural gas at more uniform daily volumes throughout the year 
demand for natural gas  which is a widely traded commodity  is sensitive to seasonal heating and industrial load requirements as well as changes in market price 
montana dakota and great plains believe that  based on regional supplies of natural gas and the pipeline transmission network currently available through its suppliers and pipeline service providers  supplies are adequate to meet its system natural gas requirements for the next five years 
regulatory matters montana dakota s and great plains retail natural gas rate schedules contain clauses permitting monthly adjustments in rates based upon changes in natural gas commodity  transportation and storage costs 
current regulatory practices allow montana dakota and great plains to recover increases or refund decreases in such costs within a period ranging from months to months from the time such changes occur 
environmental matters montana dakota s and great plains natural gas distribution operations are subject to federal  state and local environmental  facility siting  zoning and planning laws and regulations 
montana dakota and great plains believe they are in substantial compliance with those regulations 
utility services utility services is a diversified infrastructure company specializing in electric  gas and telecommunication utility construction  as well as interior industrial electrical  exterior lighting and traffic signalization 
utility services has engineering  design and build capability and provides related specialty equipment manufacturing  sales and rental services 
these services are provided to electric  gas and telecommunication companies along with municipal  commercial and industrial entities throughout most of the united states 
during  the company acquired utility services businesses based in missouri and oregon 
none of these acquisitions was individually material to the company 
utility services operates in a highly competitive business environment 
most of utility services work is obtained on the basis of competitive bids or by negotiation of either cost plus or fixed price contracts 
the workforce and equipment are highly mobile  providing greater flexibility in the size and location of utility services market area 
competition is based primarily on price and reputation for quality  safety and reliability 
the size and area location of the services provided will be a factor in the number of competitors that utility services will encounter on any particular project 
utility services believes that the diversification of the services it provides will enable it to effectively operate in this competitive environment 
utilities and independent contractors represent the largest customer base 
accordingly  utility and sub contract work accounts for a significant portion of the work performed by the utility services segment and the amount of construction contracts is dependent to a certain extent on the level and timing of maintenance and construction programs undertaken by customers 
utility services relies on repeat customers and strives to maintain successful long term relationships with these customers 
construction and maintenance crews are active year round 
however  activity in certain locations may be seasonal in nature due to the effects of weather 
utility services operates a fleet of owned and leased trucks and trailers  support vehicles and specialty construction equipment  such as backhoes  excavators  trenchers  generators  boring machines and cranes 
in addition  as of december   utility services owned or leased offices in states 
this space is used for offices  equipment yards  warehousing  storage and vehicle shops 
at december   utility service s net plant investment was approximately million 
the utility services segment backlog is comprised of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that it expects to provide under other master agreements 
the backlog at january  was approximately million 
the company expects to complete a significant amount of the backlog during the year ending december  due to the nature of its contractual arrangements  in many instances the company s customers are not committed to the specific volumes of services to be purchased under a contract  but rather the company is committed to perform these services if and to the extent requested by the customer 
the customer is  however  obligated to obtain these services from the company if they are not performed by the customer s employees 
therefore  there can be no assurance as to the customer s requirements during a particular period or that such estimates at any point in time are accurate 
pipeline and energy services general williston basin  the principal regulated business of wbi holdings  owns and operates over  miles of transmission  gathering and storage lines and owns or leases and operates compressor stations located in the states of montana  north dakota  south dakota and wyoming

under the natural gas act  as amended  williston basin and certain other operations of wbi holdings are subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc regarding certificate  rate  service and accounting matters 
system demand and competition williston basin competes with several pipelines for its customers transportation business and at times may discount rates in an effort to retain market share 
however  the strategic location of williston basin s system near five natural gas producing basins and the availability of underground storage and gathering services provided by williston basin and affiliates along with interconnections with other pipelines serve to enhance williston basin s competitive position 
although a significant portion of williston basin s firm customers  which include montana dakota  have relatively secure residential and commercial end users  virtually all have some price sensitive end users that could switch to alternate fuels 
williston basin transports substantially all of montana dakota s natural gas utilizing firm transportation agreements  which at december   represented percent of williston basin s currently subscribed firm transportation capacity 
in october  montana dakota executed a firm transportation agreement with williston basin for a term of five years expiring in june in addition  in july  montana dakota entered into a year contract with williston basin to provide firm storage services to facilitate meeting montana dakota s winter peak requirements 
on november   williston basin filed for regulatory approval to build a mile  inch natural gas pipeline that would span sections of wyoming  montana  and north dakota 
the pipeline would transport natural gas from developing coalbed and conventional natural gas production in central wyoming and south central montana to interconnecting pipelines 
depending upon the timing of the receipt of the necessary regulatory approval  construction completion could occur as early as late to mid system supply williston basin s underground storage facilities have a certificated storage capacity of approximately billion cubic feet bcf  including bcf of working gas capacity  bcf of cushion gas and bcf of native gas 
the native gas includes bcf of recoverable gas 
williston basin s storage facilities enable its customers to purchase natural gas at more uniform daily volumes throughout the year and  thus  facilitate meeting winter peak requirements 
natural gas supplies from traditional regional sources have declined during the past several years and such declines are anticipated to continue 
as a result  williston basin anticipates that a potentially significant amount of the future supply needed to meet its customers demands will come from non traditional  off system sources 
the company s coalbed natural gas assets in the powder river basin are expected to meet some of these supply needs 
williston basin expects to facilitate the movement of these supplies by making available its transportation and storage services 
williston basin will continue to look for opportunities to increase transportation and storage services through system expansion or other pipeline interconnections or enhancements which could provide substantial future benefits 
regulatory matters and revenues subject to refund in december  williston basin filed a general natural gas rate change application with the ferc 
williston basin began collecting such rates effective june   subject to refund 
on may   the administrative law judge issued an initial decision on williston basin s natural gas rate change application  which matter is currently pending before and subject to revision by the ferc 
reserves have been provided for a portion of the revenues that have been collected subject to refund with respect to the pending regulatory proceeding 
williston basin  in the fourth quarter of  determined that reserves it had previously established for certain regulatory proceedings  prior to the proceeding filed in  exceeded its expected refund obligation and  accordingly  reversed reserves and recognized in income million after tax 
williston basin  in the second quarter of  determined that reserves it had previously established in relation to a general natural gas rate change application and the general rate increase application exceeded its expected refund obligation and  accordingly  reversed reserves and recognized in income million after tax 
williston basin believes that its remaining reserves are adequate based on its assessment of the ultimate outcome of the application filed in december environmental matters wbi holdings pipeline and energy services operations are generally subject to federal  state and local environmental  facility siting  zoning and planning laws and regulations

construction materials and mining construction materials general knife river operates construction materials and mining businesses in alaska  california  hawaii  minnesota  montana  oregon and wyoming 
these operations mine  process and sell construction aggregates crushed stone  sand and gravel and supply ready mixed concrete for use in most types of construction  including homes  schools  shopping centers  office buildings and industrial parks as well as roads  freeways and bridges 
in addition  certain operations produce and sell asphalt for various commercial and roadway applications 
although not common to all locations  other products include the sale of cement  various finished concrete products and other building materials and related construction services 
during  the company acquired several construction materials and mining businesses with operations in hawaii  minnesota and oregon 
none of these acquisitions was individually material to the company 
knife river s construction materials business has continued to grow since its first acquisition in knife river continues to investigate the acquisition of other construction materials properties  particularly those relating to sand and gravel aggregates and related products such as ready mixed concrete  asphalt and various finished aggregate products 
knife river s construction materials business is expected to continue to benefit from the transportation equity act for the st century tea 
tea represents an average increase in federal highway construction funding of approximately percent for the six fiscal years ending the construction materials business had approximately million in backlog in mid february  compared to approximately million in mid february the company anticipates that a significant amount of the current backlog will be completed during the year ending december  competition knife river s construction materials products are marketed under highly competitive conditions 
since there are generally no measurable product differences in the market areas in which knife river conducts its construction materials businesses  price is the principal competitive force to which these products are subject  with service  delivery time and proximity to the customer also being significant factors 
the number and size of competitors varies in each of knife river s principal market areas and product lines 
the demand for construction materials products is significantly influenced by the cyclical nature of the construction industry in general 
in addition  construction materials activity in certain locations may be seasonal in nature due to the effects of weather 
the key economic factors affecting product demand are changes in the level of local  state and federal governmental spending  general economic conditions within the market area which influence both the commercial and private sectors  and prevailing interest rates 
knife river is not dependent on any single customer or group of customers for sales of its construction materials products  the loss of which would have a materially adverse affect on its construction materials businesses

the amounts relating to the elimination of intercompany transactions for operating revenues  purchased natural gas sold and operation and maintenance expense are as follows million  million and million for  million  million and 
million for  and million  million and 
million for  respectively 
compared to electric electric earnings increased due to higher average realized sales for resale prices  decreased interest expense due to lower average borrowings  and insurance recovery proceeds related to a outage at an electric generating station 
higher operation and maintenance expense  primarily increased payroll expense and higher subcontractor costs  and increased fuel and purchased power costs  largely higher demand charge costs related to an extended maintenance outage at an electric power supplier s generating station  partially offset the earnings increase 
also partially offsetting the earnings increase were lower sales for resale volumes  and increased depreciation  depletion and amortization expense resulting from higher property  plant and equipment balances 
natural gas distribution earnings at the natural gas distribution business decreased as a result of lower sales volumes  largely the result of weather in the fourth quarter which was percent warmer than a year ago  and higher operation and maintenance expenses  primarily increased payroll costs and higher bad debt expense 
lower average realized rates  return on natural gas storage  demand and prepaid commodity balances  and decreased service and repair margins also added to the earnings decline 
slightly offsetting the decline were decreased interest expense due to lower average borrowings  and earnings from a natural gas utility business acquired in july the pass through of higher natural gas prices resulted in the increase in sales revenue and purchased natural gas sold 
utility services utility services earnings increased as a result of earnings from businesses acquired since the comparable period last year  slightly higher operating margins from existing operations and decreased interest expense due to lower average interest rates 
the earnings improvement was partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative costs 
pipeline and energy services earnings at the pipeline and energy services business increased due to higher transportation and gathering volumes at higher average rates at the pipeline 
the absence in of an asset impairment recognized in in the amount of million after tax at one of the company s energy services companies and the net effect of the sale in of certain smaller nonstrategic properties at the pipeline also added to the earnings increase 
in addition  higher natural gas sales margins at energy services added to the earnings increase 
partially offsetting the earnings increase were the absence in of a million after tax reserve revenue adjustment and resulting increase to income relating to certain regulatory proceedings  prior to the proceeding filed in  and higher operation and maintenance expense 
the write off of an investment in a software development company of  after tax and expenses incurred for corporate development costs in connection with the pursuit of electric generation opportunities in brazil also partially offset the earnings increase 
the higher operation and maintenance expense was due primarily to increased compressor related expenses in connection with the expansion of the gathering systems 
the decrease in energy services revenue and the related decrease in purchased natural gas sold resulted from decreased energy marketing sales volumes at certain energy services operations that were sold in natural gas and oil production natural gas and oil production earnings increased largely due to higher natural gas and oil production of percent and percent since last year  respectively  combined with increased realized natural gas and oil prices which were percent and percent higher than last year  respectively 
the higher production was largely the result of a natural gas property acquisition in april and the ongoing development of that property as well as existing properties 
also adding to the earnings increase was lower interest expense  a result of lower debt balances combined with lower average rates 
partially offsetting the earnings improvement were increased operation and maintenance expense  mainly higher lease operating expenses and higher general and administrative costs 
increased depreciation  depletion and amortization expense due to higher production volumes and higher rates  and lower sales volumes of inventoried natural gas also partially offset the earnings increase 
hedging activities for natural gas and oil production for resulted in realized prices that were percent and percent  respectively  of what otherwise would have been received 
construction materials and mining earnings for the construction materials and mining business increased largely due to earnings from businesses acquired since the comparable period last year and increases at existing asphalt  aggregate  cement and ready mixed concrete construction materials operations 
also adding to the earnings increase was a one time gain from the sale of the coal operations of million million after tax  including final settlement cost adjustments  included in other income net  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  partially offset by lower coal sales volumes due primarily to four months of operations in compared to months in also partially offsetting the earnings increase were lower construction margins  largely resulting from increased competition and less available work  and the absence in of a gain of million after tax on the sale of a nonstrategic property 
increased interest expense due to higher acquisition related borrowings  higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense due to increased plant balances  and higher selling  general and administrative costs also partially offset the earnings improvement 
compared to electric electric earnings increased due to higher demand related retail sales to all major customer classes  higher average realized rates and lower employee benefit related expenses 
increased fuel and purchased power costs  largely higher purchased power costs  increased coal costs  and higher natural gas generation related costs  partially offset the earnings increase 
higher maintenance expense at certain of the company s electric generating stations  and increased depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  resulting from higher property  plant and equipment balances  also partially offset the earnings increase 
natural gas distribution earnings improved at the natural gas distribution business largely due to higher weather related retail sales volumes resulting from weather in the fourth quarter which was percent colder than the same period in increased service and repair margins  earnings from great plains  which was acquired in july  and higher transportation volumes also added to the earnings increase 
increased depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  due to higher property  plant and equipment balances  and lower average realized transportation rates  partially offset the earnings increase 
utility services utility services earnings increased as a result of earnings from businesses acquired since the comparable period in  higher work load in the rocky mountain region  primarily related to fiber optic installation projects  and increases from engineering services 
this increase was somewhat offset by decreased construction activity for utilities on the west coast  largely the result of utility merger activity and the california energy crisis 
pipeline and energy services pipeline and energy services earnings decreased primarily due to the absence in of a million after tax reserve revenue adjustment and resulting increase to income associated with ferc orders received in the and general rate proceedings  the recognition in of a million after tax reserve adjustment and resulting increase to income relating to the resolution of certain production tax and other state tax matters  and the recognition in income in of million after tax resulting from a favorable order received from the united states court of appeals for the dc circuit court relating to the general rate proceeding 
an asset impairment charge of million after tax in at one of the company s energy services companies also lowered earnings 
in addition  higher bad debt expense and lower natural gas margins from energy services  and higher operation and maintenance expenses at the pipeline  largely higher compressor related expenses and payroll costs  contributed to the decline in earnings 
partially offsetting the decline in earnings was the recognition in of a million after tax reserve revenue adjustment and resulting increase to income relating to certain regulatory proceedings  as previously discussed 
higher natural gas transportation volumes combined with higher average transportation rates and increased gathering volumes at the pipeline also partially offset the earnings decline 
the increase in energy services revenue and the related increase in purchased natural gas sold resulted from significantly higher natural gas prices and increased volumes 
natural gas and oil production natural gas and oil production earnings increased primarily due to significantly higher realized natural gas and oil prices 
higher natural gas and oil production due to acquisitions since the comparable period in and ongoing development of existing properties  along with increased other revenue due to higher sales of inventoried natural gas  added to the earnings increase 
partially offsetting the earnings improvement were increased depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  due to higher production volumes and higher rates  and increased operation and maintenance expense  mainly from higher lease operating expenses and higher general and administrative costs due primarily to acquisitions  and increased maintenance on existing properties 
increased interest expense due to higher average borrowings and interest rates also partially offset the earnings increase 
hedging activities for natural gas and oil production for resulted in realized prices that were percent and percent  respectively  of what otherwise would have been received 
construction materials and mining construction materials and mining earnings increased largely due to the absence in of million in after tax charges to earnings in  the result of the resolution of the coal arbitration proceeding 
higher earnings at the construction materials operations as a result of earnings from businesses acquired since the comparable period in  higher aggregate  ready mixed concrete and cement volumes at existing operations and a gain of million after tax on the sale of a nonstrategic property also added to the earnings improvement 
increased interest expense resulting from higher acquisition related borrowings  higher selling  general and administrative costs  higher energy costs and increased depreciation  depletion and amortization expense due to increased aggregate volumes and increased plant balances  partially offset the earnings improvement at the construction materials operations

as franchises expire  montana dakota may face increasing competition in its service areas  particularly its service to smaller towns  from rural electric cooperatives 
montana dakota intends to protect its service area and seek renewal of all expiring franchises and will continue to take steps to effectively operate in an increasingly competitive environment 
the north dakota public service commission ndpsc has authorized its staff to initiate an investigation into the earnings levels of montana dakota s north dakota electric operations based on montana dakota s annual report to the ndpsc 
the investigation is based on a complaint filed with the ndpsc on september   by the staff

the company is unable to predict the outcome of the investigation at this time  but does not expect the final resolution to be material to its results of operations 
due to growing electric demand  a megawatt gas turbine power plant may be added in the three to five year planning horizon 
currently  the company is working with the state of north dakota to determine the feasibility of constructing a megawatt lignite fired power plant in western north dakota 
the first preliminary decision is expected in december natural gas distribution annual natural gas throughput for is expected to be approximately million decatherms  with about million decatherms from sales and million decatherms from transportation 
utility services revenues for this segment are expected to exceed million in this segment s goal is to achieve compound annual revenue and earnings growth rates of approximately percent to percent over the next five years 
however  the general weakening of the economy has added uncertainty in the ability of the company to achieve this goal particularly in the early years of the planning cycle 
pipeline and energy services in  natural gas throughput from this segment  including both transportation and gathering  is expected to increase by approximately percent 
a mile pipeline to transport additional gas to market and enhance the use of the company s storage facilities is currently under regulatory review 
depending upon the timing of the receipt of the necessary regulatory approval  construction completion could occur as early as late to mid the company continues to pursue electric generation opportunities in brazil 
these projects are targeted toward a niche market where the company expects to provide energy on a contract basis in order to reduce risk 
the first project  a megawatt natural gas fired generating facility  is planned to begin production during the second quarter of on february   centennial power  inc  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company  announced the acquisition of rocky mountain power  inc the acquisition enables the company to construct a megawatt  coal fired electric generation facility plant near hardin  montana

critical accounting policies the company has prepared its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and these statements necessarily include some amounts that are based on informed judgments and estimates of management 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties which affect the application of such policies 
as discussed below the company s financial position or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the company s critical accounting policies include impairment of long lived assets and intangibles the company reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets  including goodwill and identifiable intangibles  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable and annually for goodwill as required by sfas no 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of intangible assets due to changes in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of the company s assets and result in an impairment charge 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenues performance measures 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
impairment testing of natural gas and oil properties the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its natural gas and oil production activities as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the full cost method of accounting requires judgments and uncertainties including specific point in time natural gas and oil prices used for valuing reserves and estimates of reserves 
sustained downward movements in natural gas and oil prices and changes in estimates of reserve quantities could result in a future write down of the company s natural gas and oil properties 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the earnings process is complete  as evidenced by an agreement between the customer and the company  when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  when the fee is fixed or determinable and when collection is probable 
the company s revenue recognition policy is discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the recognition of revenue in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue 
estimates related to the recognition of revenue include the accumulated provision for revenues subject to refund  natural gas and oil revenues and costs on construction contracts under the percentage of completion method 
as additional information becomes available  or actual amounts are determinable  the recorded estimates are revised 
consequently  operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates

for more information on the company s derivative instruments see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
material changes to the company s results of operations could occur if the hedging instrument is not highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk 
the fair value of the derivative instruments is based on valuations determined by the counterparties 
changes in counterparty valuation assumptions and estimates could cause a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
purchase accounting the company accounts for its acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the acquired assets and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values 
the recorded values of assets and liabilities are based on third party estimates and valuations when available 
the remaining values are based on management s judgments and estimates  and accordingly  the company s financial position or results of operations may be affected by changes in estimates and judgments 
accounting for the effects of regulation substantially all of the company s regulatory assets  other than certain deferred income taxes  are being reflected in rates charged to customers in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of regulation sfas no 

if  for any reason  the company s regulated businesses cease to meet the criteria for application of sfas no 
for all or part of their operations  the regulatory assets and liabilities relating to those portions ceasing to meet such criteria would be removed from the balance sheet and included in the statement of income as an extraordinary item in the period in which the discontinuance of sfas no 
occurs
