item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
all of these statements are based on information available to us as of the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain risk factors including  but not limited to  those discussed under the heading factors that may affect future results 
overview we provide software products that enable organizations to effectively manage their database infrastructure 
our database administration  performance management  data and application architecture and data integration products offer customers comprehensive solutions for managing the database life cycle  which is the process of creating  optimizing and managing key business applications and their underlying databases in response to evolving business requirements 
by simplifying the management of the database life cycle  our products allow organizations to ensure the availability  performance and reliability of their critical business applications 
we were incorporated in california as client worx  inc in july and changed our name to embarcadero technologies  inc in october we reincorporated in delaware in february at our inception  we focused on developing and marketing software for use with sybase and microsoft sql server databases 
in december  we introduced rapid sql for sybase and microsoft sql server database development 
in july  we introduced dbartisan for the administration of sybase and microsoft sql server databases 
in september  we released er studio  our database design solution  which was our first product to offer support for ibm db universal database  informix and oracle  as well as sybase and microsoft sql server 
the success of er studio s multi vendor support led us to add support for other major databases to our other products 
we added oracle support to dbartisan in april and to rapid sql in january we added support for ibm db universal database to both products in mid in  we also began to enhance our products with add ons and companion products 
in october  we offered our first standalone companion product  er studio viewer  which complemented the er studio product 
in april  we introduced dbartisan schema manager as a standalone companion product and changed the product name to dbartisan change manager in january in  we introduced embarcadero job scheduler  designed to simplify database administration by enabling database professionals to automate their scheduling tasks and manage them from a single  easy to use graphical console 
also in  we introduced embarcadero sql debugger and embarcadero sql profiler add ons to extend the functionality of rapid sql and dbartisan 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed three acquisitions embarcadero europe ltd  advanced software technologies  inc and engineeringperformance  inc embarcadero europe ltd 
serves as our sales and marketing office for europe  the middle east and africa 
in connection with our acquisition of advanced software technologies  inc  we introduced gdpro renamed describe in  an application design product 
during the first quarter of  we introduced embarcadero performance center and embarcadero sql tuner  both of which are designed to improve the availability and performance of databases 
we introduced describe  the successor to gd pro  which is used to design and document enterprise applications  in the second quarter of two new products were released during the third quarter of  data voyager  for publishing and managing test and reference data  and repository for er studio  for enabling collaborative database design among er studio users 
in the fourth quarter of  we delivered dt studio  a java based data integration product that can transform and move data from a number of disparate data sources to a wide variety of relational database targets 
sources of revenue and revenue recognition policy revenues are primarily derived from software license fees and related maintenance contracts 
revenues from software license fees are recognized upon shipment  when terms are fob shipping point  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
evidence of an arrangement may be an order accompanied by pre payment via check or credit card  a signed purchase order or an equivalent form of documentation from the customer 
maintenance contracts generally cover a one year term paid for in advance  and revenues from maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the contract term 
most license orders have multiple obligations  both deliverable products and related maintenance  and revenues are allocated to each undelivered component of the contract based on objective evidence of its fair value  which is specific to the company 
we recognize revenues allocated when the criteria for revenue recognition set forth above are met 
while some revenues are collected via credit card at the time an order is placed  customers are generally granted payment terms of net thirty days 
products may be sold through resellers and distributors in the united states and certain international markets 
revenues from software license fees and maintenance contracts sold through resellers or distributors are recognized under the same criteria as those sold by the company 
distributors purchase products to fulfill specific customer orders and generally do not hold inventory of the company s products 
we market our software and related maintenance services directly through our telesales and field sales organizations in the united states  canada and the united kingdom  and indirectly through our distribution partners worldwide 
we intend to expand our international sales activities in an effort to increase revenues from foreign sales 
there can be no assurance that our license and maintenance revenues  results of operations  cash flows from operations and financial condition will not be adversely affected in future periods as a result of continued downturns in global economic conditions and increased competitive pressures

total revenues were million  million and million for  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and from to license 
license revenues were million  million and million for  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and from to the increases from to and to were due to greater market acceptance of our products  greater breadth of product offerings and an increase in sales staff and sales staff productivity 
the rate of revenue growth from to slowed from the previous period due primarily to changes in macro economic conditions for more detail  refer to the section factors that may affect future results in this report and the resulting impact on it spending 
future license revenues and growth rates will vary based on it spending patterns  acceptance of products and competitive conditions  among other factors  and cannot be predicted 
maintenance 
maintenance revenues were million  million and million for  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and from to the increase in each year was due to the then current increase in the number of licenses sold and a corresponding increase in customer base and maintenance renewals 
maintenance revenues are a factor of both new licenses sold and renewal rates for existing licenses 
future license sales as well as the percentage of existing license holders who opt to renew their maintenance agreements in the future will impact maintenance revenues 
cost of revenues in thousands year ended december  cost of revenues license license  other amortization of acquired technology total license maintenance maintenance  other amortization of non cash stock based compensation total maintenance total cost of revenues license 
cost of license revenues consists primarily of amortization of acquired technology  royalties  product media and packaging  shipping fees  duplication expenses and amortization of capitalized research and development expenses 
cost of license revenues was million   and  for  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and from to the increase in absolute dollars from to was due to an increase in the number of licenses sold 
the increase in absolute dollars from to was due to amortization of acquired technology that was purchased in the fourth quarter of and an increase in royalties attributable to the number of licenses sold 
cost of license revenues represented  and of license revenues in  and  respectively 
excluding amortization of acquired technology  as a percentage of license revenue  cost of license was  and in  and  respectively 
this decrease from to was due to economies of scale for media and packaging purchasing and duplication services 
cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenues may vary in the future depending on the mix of internally developed versus externally licensed products and product components 
additionally  as more products for which some research and development costs have been capitalized come to market see note to the consolidated financial statements  the related amortization expense will increase cost of license in absolute dollars and likely increase cost of license as a percentage of license revenues 
maintenance 
cost of maintenance revenues consists primarily of customer support personnel and related expenses  including payroll  employee benefits and non cash stock based compensation 
cost of maintenance revenues was million  million and  for  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and from to cost of maintenance revenues represented  and of maintenance revenues in  and  respectively 
excluding non cash stock based compensation  cost of maintenance revenues represented  and of maintenance revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars from to to was due primarily to an increase in the number of customer support personnel hired to service our expanding worldwide customer base and the associated increase in overhead allocation 
the increase in customer support personnel is due to hiring as well as the inclusion of personnel absorbed through acquisitions in the fourth quarter of we expect that cost of maintenance revenues will likely increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we hire more support personnel to support our expanding customer base

excluding non cash stock based compensation  as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses were   and in  and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue from to to was due primarily to an increase in spending on outside software development contractors and an increase in the number of personnel in our research and development organization  both domestically and in our research and development facility in canada  and the associated increase in overhead allocation 
the increase in personnel is due to hiring as well as the inclusion of personnel absorbed through acquisitions in the fourth quarter of we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as additional development personnel are hired and as we expand our product development activities 
sales and marketing in thousands year ended december  sales and marketing sales and marketing  other amortization of non cash stock based compensation total sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions earned by sales personnel  non cash stock based compensation  trade shows  travel and other marketing communication costs  such as advertising and other marketing programs 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million for  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and from to the increase in absolute dollars from to was due to increases in headcount and related expenses as well as an increase in non cash stock based compensation 
the increase in absolute dollars from to was primarily due to increases in headcount and related expenses  slightly offset by a reduction in non cash stock based compensation 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
excluding non cash stock based compensation  as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars from to was due to an increase in headcount and related expenses  increased commissions based on sales volume  costs associated with the expansion of the field sales organization and expanded marketing programs 
we have invested  and we plan to continue to invest  resources to expand our sales and marketing efforts 
as a result  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods

we expect general and administrative expenses  excluding amortization of non cash stock based compensation  to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our administrative staff and facilities to support larger operations 
purchased in process research and development 
in november  we acquired advanced software technologies  inc for million in cash 
in connection with this acquisition  we expensed million of purchased in process research and development 
the in process technology related to two identifiable projects a major version release of advanced software technologies gdpro product and a new software product featuring design and documentation features 
the purchased in process research and development for each project was  and  respectively 
the projects were approximately and approximately complete at the time of the acquisitions  with significant remaining development efforts necessary to complete the projects 
these efforts included enhancing and broadening support of large team  multi user functions  broadening use to integrated development environments  and integrating with our existing technology 
also in november  we acquired engineeringperformance  inc for million in cash and  shares of the company s common stock 
in connection with this acquisition  we expensed million of purchased in process research and development 
the in process technology related to a software product that is designed to be used to test and analyze the performance of e business applications 
the project was approximately complete at the time of the acquisition  with significant remaining development efforts necessary to complete the project 
these efforts included extending support to cover all industry standard protocols and maximizing capability and compatibility across multiple platforms 
the values assigned to the in process research and development acquired in the above acquisitions were based on established valuation techniques 
at the time of the acquisitions  the in process research and development was expensed as a non recurring charge  as the in process technology had not yet reached technological feasibility 
the fair value allocation to in process research and development was determined by identifying the research projects for each acquisition for which technological feasibility had not been achieved and which had no alternative future use at the acquisition date  estimating the additional costs to be incurred to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products  assessing the stage and expected date of completion of the research and development effort at the acquisition date  and estimating the resulting net cash flows  and then estimating the net present value of the cash flows back to their present value 
the discount rate includes a risk adjusted rate to take into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology 
the discount rate applied to the project cash flows was for the in process technology of advanced software technologies  inc and for engineeringperformance  inc 
the valuation for advanced software technologies  inc includes cash inflows from in process technology through with revenue expected to commence in and from the respective projects 
the valuation for engineeringperformance  inc includes cash inflows from in process technology through with revenue expected to commence in we believe that the estimated in process technology amounts represent fair value and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
we had no charges for purchased in process research and development in or purchased in process research and development costs in future years will depend entirely upon acquisition activities and cannot be estimated in advance of an acquisition 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in connection with the acquisitions of advanced software technologies  inc  engineeringperformance  inc  and the remaining of embarcadero europe ltd  we recorded million of goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of the total amortization expense related to these costs in and was million and  respectively 
approximately  and  of this amortization expense was recorded as cost of license revenue in and  respectively 
the remaining million and  of expense in and  respectively  was recorded as an operating expense 
we ceased amortization of goodwill when we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
effective january  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
going forward  we will test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or in the event of a significant change in our business 
if  in the future  we determine that this goodwill is impaired  we will be required to take a non recurring charge to write down this asset 
the dollar amount s of such potential future charge s  if any  cannot currently be estimated 
the intangible assets of million related to acquired technology will continue to be amortized over their remaining useful life with the related amortization recorded as cost of license revenue 
lease related impairment loss 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a provision for an impairment loss of million related to office leases in san francisco and boston  management has decided to abandon and sublease these office spaces in order to streamline operations 
the impairment loss consists of approximately million in contractual obligations under the facilities leases  net of estimated sub lease income from the projected date of abandonment to the end of the lease term 
the remaining  consists of approximately  in write downs to leasehold improvements and other assets attributable to the abandoned space  as well as approximately  in other expenses related to securing the sublease arrangements 
when we recorded the lease related impairment loss  we made estimates about sublease costs and income 
each reporting period we will review these estimates  to the extent that these assumptions change due to changes in the market  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these abandoned facilities could vary in the future 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes was million in  million in and  in the increase from to is due to an increase in our effective tax rate resulting from our conversion to a c corporation from an s corporation for income tax purposes effective january  and an increase in non deductible expenses for tax purposes  partially offset by an increase in tax free interest income 
since january   the company has been subject to corporate federal and state income taxes 
the decrease in the provision for income taxes from to is the result of tax exempt interest income and an increased research and development tax credit resulting from a corresponding increase in qualified research and development expenses 
share in loss of joint venture and affiliated company 
in september  we formed a joint venture with aztec software  inc aztec  a california corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of aztec software and technology services limited  an indian company publicly traded on the bombay stock exchange 
under the terms of the agreement  embarcadero and aztec are required to contribute million each to the venture  as of december   each party had contributed  we account for this venture under the equity method of accounting see note to our consolidated financial statements 
for our fifty percent share in the loss of the venture in the year ended december   we recorded  as a loss from joint venture and affiliated company on our consolidated statement of operations 
in the first quarter of  each party made their remaining  contribution to the venture 
the future amount of income or loss recorded from the venture cannot currently be estimated 
there can be no assurances that we will realize any income from our investment in this entity 
in september  we acquired a interest in embarcadero europe ltd  which became our affiliated distributor for europe  the middle east and africa 
our share in the loss of embarcadero europe ltd 
was  for with our acquisition of the remaining of embarcadero europe ltd 
in october  its operations are now included in our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our business to date from cash generated by our operations and proceeds from sales of equity 
in april  we completed our initial public offering of common stock  generating net proceeds to us of approximately million 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and  for  and  respectively 
in all three years  cash used in investing activities included purchases of computer equipment  software  leasehold improvements  fixtures and furniture 
in  million  net was used to purchase marketable securities  million was used to acquire technology and  was invested in a joint venture see note to our consolidated financial statements 
there were no such uses of cash in or in  million of the cash used in investing activities was used to acquire other entities as described below 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed three acquisitions  all accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
under this method of accounting  the purchase price is allocated to the value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
in october  we acquired the remaining interest in our affiliate  embarcadero europe ltd  for million in cash 
in november  we acquired advanced software technologies  inc  based in littleton  colorado  for million in cash 
also in november  we acquired engineeringperformance  inc  based in toronto  canada  for approximately million in cash and  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was  in  million in and million in in  net cash used in financing activities consisted of million used for repurchase of the company s common stock  offset by million of cash provided by exercise of stock options under the company s stock option plan 
net cash provided by financing activities in came predominately from million in net proceeds from the company s initial public offering of common stock and to a lesser extent from the proceeds from the sale of the company s series a preferred stock and the exercise of stock options under the company s stock option plan 
net cash used in financing activities in was primarily for a distribution of cash to stockholders 
we have a million revolving credit facility with a bank that bears interest at the prime rate and expires on may  the credit facility requires that the company maintain various quarterly financial covenants including covenants related to tangible net worth  total liabilities and profitability  we were in compliance with all covenants at december  the annual fee to maintain this credit facility is  and funds drawn from this credit facility can be used for general operating activities 
we have not drawn on this credit facility  accordingly  as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under this credit facility 
we had deferred tax assets totaling million at december  we believe that these assets will be realizable in the future 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to finance our operations through at least the next to months 
if we fail to generate cash flow from operations in the future due to an unexpected decline in revenues or due to a sustained increase in cash expenditures in excess of revenues generated  our cash balances may not be sufficient to fund continuing operations without obtaining additional financing 
if additional financing is needed  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
critical accounting policies a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements  and the impacts and risks associated with our accounting policies are discussed throughout this annual report on form k and in the footnotes to the financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgment and or estimates by management at the time that financial statements are prepared such that materially different results might have been reported if other assumptions had been made 
below is further discussion of the polices that we consider to be our critical accounting policies  including revenue recognition  joint venture accounting  capitalized research and development costs  lease related impairment loss  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are principally derived from product license sales and related maintenance and support contracts 
customers that license our software products also generally purchase maintenance and support contracts that provide software updates and technical support over a stated term  usually one year 
we sell packaged software products that generally do not require us to perform any special installation or integration services 
we primarily sell our products through our direct sales force 
our products are sold under a perpetual license model 
updates and upgrades to our products are made available to customers who have purchased maintenance and support contracts 
we do not recognize revenue for refundable fees or agreements with cancellation rights until such rights to refund or cancellation have expired 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant implementation obligations by us remain  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized only when the fee is collected 
sop  as amended  generally requires that revenues earned from software arrangements involving multiple elements be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
revenue recognized from multiple element arrangements is allocated to undelivered elements of the arrangement  such as maintenance and support services  based on the relative fair values of the elements specific to us 
our determination of fair value of each element in multi element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management  having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
revenue allocated to maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the maintenance term  typically one year 
deferred revenue  which consists primarily of maintenance and support services that customers have contracted for in advance but for which revenue has not been recognized  is recognized as services are rendered or as other requirements requiring deferral under sop are satisfied 
joint venture accounting 
we have a fifty percent interest in a joint venture that is primarily engaged in software development 
aztec software  inc aztec owns the remaining fifty percent interest in this venture 
in  much of our purchased technology was acquired from aztec 
in addition  aztec is one of our customers 
however  all transactions with aztec have been conducted at arms length and were recorded at their fair value 
our investment in this entity is accounted for under the equity method of accounting and  accordingly  we recognize fifty percent of the income or loss from this venture in our consolidated statements of operations 
our policy for determining how to account for investments is discussed in note to our consolidated financial statement under the heading consolidation 
this venture was formed in the third quarter of and generated a loss in we have the right of first refusal to purchase any software developed by the venture 
if we exercise this right of first refusal  or if an independent third party purchases software from the venture  we will benefit in the form of income  or reduced loss  from the joint venture through our fifty percent interest in the venture 
if we purchase software from the venture that has reached technological feasibility in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
see discussion below under capitalized research and development costs  the costs will be recorded on our financial statements as capitalized research and development 
if the purchased software is not deemed to have reached technological feasibility  the costs will be recorded as research and development expense 
additional details of this venture are discussed in this management s discussion and analysis under the heading share in loss of joint venture and affiliated company and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
capitalized research and development costs 
capitalized research and development costs include certain costs associated with acquiring and developing the technology used in our licensed products 
research and development costs are capitalized in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  which permits capitalization of research and development costs only after technological feasibility has been established 
we consider technological feasibility to have been established when a working model that includes all significant planned features and functionality exists 
accordingly  purchased technology is capitalized if it has reached technological feasibility at the time of acquisition  costs of developed technology are capitalized after technological feasibility is reached 
costs of purchased and developed technology are capitalized and amortized on a product by product basis over their remaining estimated useful lives at the greater of straight line or the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product 
amortization begins when technology is available for sale 
estimated useful lives of capitalized technology are generally three years 
capitalized software costs were million in further detail and a discussion of our policies related to capitalized software can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements under the heading capitalized software development costs 
lease related impairment loss 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  in the third quarter of we recorded a significant restructuring charge in connection with our abandonment of certain operating leases as part of a program to restructure our operations and related facilities 
lease abandonment costs were estimated to include the impairment of leasehold improvements and remaining lease liabilities and brokerage fees  offset by estimated sublease income 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on assumptions about the time period required to locate and contract with suitable sub lessees as well as the sublease rates that can be achieved  as determined by using market trend information analyses provided by a commercial real estate brokerage we retained 
we review these estimates each reporting period  to the extent that these assumptions change due to market conditions  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these abandoned facilities could vary by material amounts 
accounting for income taxes 
in conjunction with preparing our consolidated financial statements  we must estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we had deferred tax assets of million and deferred tax liabilities of million 
a detailed discussion of our income tax provision and the components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  as well as interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective january  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
in september  the fasb issued two statements  sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and amends apb no 
business combinations 
all business combinations in the scope of this statement are to be accounted for using one method  the purchase method 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes apb no 
 intangible assets 
it changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
the company ceased the amortization of goodwill that was recorded in past business combinations on january   as required by sfas no 
as a result  as of january   approximately million of goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be tested annually for impairment in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
factors that may affect future results in addition to other information in this report  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in future periods  and  as a result  our stock price may fluctuate or decline 
our growth rates may not be sustainable and you should not use our past performance to predict future results 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our historical results of operations are not indicative of our future performance 
our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including the factors discussed below under the captions we may be required to change our revenue recognition policies based on changing implementation guidelines and interpretations  which could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly  large sales of our products and maintenance involve a lengthy sales cycle  which could cause delays in recognizing revenue or the failure to obtain revenue  the impact of changes in global economic conditions on our customers may cause us to fail to meet expectations  which would negatively impact the price of our stock  our operating results would be harmed if the database industry continues in a downward cycle  we expect to incur increases in our operating expenses in the foreseeable future  which may affect our profitability  if our products do not perform as expected  we may lose customers  our costs will increase and revenues may be delayed or lost  acquisitions of companies or technologies may result in disruptions to our business  we may have future non recurring charges in the event of goodwill impairment  and if we are not able to enhance our existing products to adapt to rapid technological change  or we introduce new products that do not achieve market acceptance  our revenue and earnings may suffer and we may experience loss of market share 
seasonal variations in orders for our products also contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
these fluctuations are likely to cause corresponding volatility in our stock price  particularly if our operating results vary from analysts expectations 
if sales of dbartisan fall  our revenues and income may decline 
a large portion of our revenues currently comes from sales of our dbartisan product 
for the years ended december   and  dbartisan accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our domestic license revenues 
we expect that sales of dbartisan will continue to represent a substantial portion of our license revenues for the foreseeable future 
in addition  many of our customers initiate a relationship with us by purchasing dbartisan 
if demand for dbartisan declines due to competition  technological change or other factors  our revenues and income may decline significantly 
if we do not continue to add new customers  we will not be able to sustain or increase our revenues 
our license arrangements do not generally provide for substantial ongoing license or maintenance payments 
therefore  our future revenue growth depends on our continued success in attracting new customers or expanding our relationships with existing customers 
our ability to attract new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers will depend on a variety of factors  including the performance  quality  breadth and depth of our current and future products and maintenance 
our failure to add new customers or to expand our relationships with existing customers would reduce our future revenues 
we may be required to change our revenue recognition policies based on changing implementation guidelines and interpretations  which may cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 
in recent years  software revenue recognition rules have been under heavy review and interpretation by various accounting authoritative and regulatory bodies  including the american institute for certified public accountants and the financial accounting standards board 
these reviews and interpretations have resulted in significant changes in the practices and standards for recognizing revenues in software companies 
the rapid pace of change in these standards could result in significantly different standards in the future 
we may have to change our methods of revenue recognition to comply with new standards  and any such change could cause deferment of revenue recognized in current periods to subsequent periods or accelerated recognition of deferred revenue to current periods  either of which could cause shortfalls in meeting securities analysts and investors expectations in any period 
any such shortfalls could have an adverse impact on our stock price 
we invest heavily in research and development with no guarantee of return from the investments that we make 
we are nearing the end of a cycle of significant new product development 
we have invested significant resources in the development of these new products  if our new products are not accepted in the marketplace  we could suffer a contraction of revenue growth and have limited return on the investments that we have made 
in addition  we plan to continue to invest in research and development and could suffer the same effects from these future investments 
large sales of our products and maintenance involve a lengthy sales cycle  which could cause delays in recognizing revenue or the failure to obtain revenue 
in the past year  large sales of our products and maintenance to individual customers have increased 
these large sales typically involve sales cycles from months to months  which is considerably longer than our historical sales cycle 
this lengthy sales cycle is due to the need to educate and convince prospective customers of the value of our products and to gain approval from a variety of constituencies within a prospective customer  including key management personnel 
the timing of our revenues has become more difficult to forecast because of this lengthy sales cycle for large sales 
we may expend substantial funds and effort to negotiate these sales with prospective customers but then be delayed in concluding  or be unable to conclude  sales of our products and maintenance 
any delay in  or failure to complete  sales in a particular period would reduce our revenues in that period as well as in subsequent periods over which revenues for the sale may be recognized 
if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens in general or for one or more large sales  it could negatively affect the timing of our revenues and our revenue growth and may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
if we were to experience a delay on a large order  it could harm our ability to meet our forecasts for a given period 
the impact of changes in global economic conditions on our customers may cause us to fail to meet expectations  which would negatively impact the price of our stock 
our operating results can vary significantly based upon the impact of changes in global and domestic economic conditions on our customers 
the domestic and economic environment in continues to be uncertain 
the september  terrorist attacks in new york city  washington  dc and pennsylvania  and the continuing united states military response  has affected the economic environment 
at the time of the attacks  capital investment by businesses  particularly investments in new technology  had been experiencing substantial weakness 
this weakness was aggravated by the september  attacks and continues into current economic and political uncertainty could result in further decline in new technology investments 
these uncertainties could cause customers to defer or reconsider purchasing products or services if they experience a downturn in their business or if there is a further downturn in the general economy 
such events could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our operating results would be harmed if the database industry continues in a downward cycle 
the markets into which we sell our products are cyclical and are subject to general economic conditions 
the database industry has experienced a downturn due to declines in general economic conditions 
for example  a number of companies that sell the database platforms that our products support  including oracle corporation  have reduced revenue and earnings expectations 
in addition  we believe that the current economic downturn has had an impact on capital spending for database technology and related products 
we are uncertain as to how long and how deep the current downturn may be in the database market 
any continued or further slowdowns in the database market or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and would harm our business 
if we cannot manage our expansion effectively  our rate of growth and income may decline 
we have recently experienced a period of expansion in our operations  both through internal growth as well as through acquisitions of companies in the united kingdom  colorado and canada 
this growth has placed  and will continue to place  a strain on our management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure and we may not be able to effectively manage our growth in the future 
to support our expanding operations  we have increased the number of our full time employees from as of december   to as of december   as of december  and as of december  we expect to hire additional employees to manage our expanding operations 
our ability to manage growth requires that we continue to improve our operational  financial and management controls and procedures 
if we are unable to manage this growth effectively  our rate of growth and our income may decline 
we expect to incur increases in our operating expenses in the foreseeable future  which may affect our profitability 
we intend to increase our operating expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to increase our sales and marketing  research and development activities and customer support operations 
in connection with these expanded operations  we will need to increase our revenues 
however  we will incur these increased expenses before we realize any increased revenues related to this spending 
if these efforts do not increase revenues  our profitability may decline 
the expansion of our international operations exposes us to risks 
one aspect of our growth strategy is to expand our international operations 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  we expanded our sales and marketing capabilities by acquiring a company with operations in the united kingdom 
also in  we acquired a company with operations in canada  which expanded our research and development capabilities 
as a result  we could face a number of risks from our expanding international operations  including staffing and managing foreign operations  increased financial accounting and reporting complexities  potentially adverse tax consequences  the loss of revenues and net income resulting from currency fluctuations  compliance with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  licenses  tariffs and other trade barriers  longer sales and payment cycles  and costs and difficulties of customizing products for foreign countries 
further expansion of our international operations may require significant management attention and financial resources and may place burdens on our management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure 
our possible investments in establishing facilities in other countries may not produce desired levels of revenue or profitability 
if our products do not perform as expected  we may lose customers  our costs will increase and revenues may be delayed or lost 
computer software such as ours often contains undetected errors and may contain design flaws 
errors may be found in current versions  new versions or enhancements of our products after we make commercial shipments 
if our software contains undetected errors  performs unreliably  or if we otherwise fail to meet our customers expectations  we may suffer loss of revenues  market share or customers  negative publicity and harm to our reputation  diversion of research and development and management resources  increased maintenance and warranty costs  legal actions by customers against us  and increased insurance costs 
acquisitions of companies or technologies may result in disruptions to our business 
in the fourth quarter of  we acquired embarcadero europe ltd  based in maidenhead  united kingdom  advanced software technologies  inc  based in littleton  colorado and engineeringperformance  inc  based in toronto  canada 
we are still integrating these operations into our existing operations 
if we are unable to successfully integrate with our existing operations these and any other businesses  products or technologies that we acquire  we may not receive the intended benefits of such acquisitions and the revenue and operating results of the combined company may decline 
in addition  acquisitions may subject us to unanticipated liabilities or risks 
we may continue to make additional strategic acquisitions of companies  products or technologies as necessary in order to implement our business strategy 
any acquisition may temporarily disrupt our operations and divert management s attention from day to day operations 
while we have financed our acquisitions to date primarily with working capital  we may incur debt or issue equity securities to finance future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities for any acquisition could be substantially dilutive to our stockholders 
in addition  our profitability may suffer due to acquisition related expenses 
we may have future non recurring charges in the event of goodwill impairment 
we adopted sfas no 
as of january  and  as a result  we have ceased amortization of goodwill 
going forward  we must test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or in the event of a significant change in our business 
at january  our net goodwill totaled million 
in the future  if we determine that this goodwill is impaired  we will be required to take a non recurring charge to write down this asset 
if we are not able to enhance our existing products to adapt to rapid technological change  or we introduce new products that do not achieve market acceptance  our revenue and earnings may suffer and we may experience loss of market share 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent product introductions and enhancements  uncertain product life cycles and changes in customer demands and industry standards 
our success depends on our ability to continue to enhance our current products  introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments  satisfy increasingly complicated customer requirements  integrate our products with multiple database platforms  and modify our products as database platforms change 
however  due to the nature of computing environments and the performance demanded by customers for database management software  new products and product enhancements could require longer development and testing periods than we currently anticipate 
moreover  if we develop new products that do not achieve market acceptance  we may not be able to recoup devel opment and marketing expenses  which could harm our operating results 
the introduction of new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards may render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
delays in the general availability of new releases or problems in the installation or implementation of new releases could harm our business and operating results 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products or new product enhancements that respond to technological change  evolving industry standards or customer requirements 
our failure to do so would render our products obsolete and could harm our ability to compete 
in addition  our products and product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance 
if we are not able to attract and retain qualified personnel  our business will not be able to grow 
our success depends on the continued service of our executive officers and other key administrative  sales and marketing  research and development and support personnel 
none of our executive officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 
if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees  or if one or more of them decide to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  our business could be seriously harmed 
our business will not be able to grow if we cannot attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
despite the economic downturn  competition for qualified employees remains intense and we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain highly qualified personnel in the future 
there has in the past been and there may in the future be a shortage of personnel that possess the technical background necessary to sell  support and develop our products effectively 
some of our current employees and those that we seek to hire may be subject to non competition or non solicitation covenants that could further limit our ability to attract or retain qualified personnel 
we are susceptible to business interruptions that could harm our business 
our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses  human error  natural disasters  telecommunications failures  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
in particular  our corporate headquarters are located in san francisco  which is known for seismic activity 
although we have a disaster recovery plan for critical data and business applications  this does not provide assurance that we would not suffer a business interruption 
a significant business interruption would result in losses or damages incurred by us and would harm our business 
our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses that might occur 
insiders have substantial control over us  which could limit others ability to influence the outcome of key transactions 
our executive officers and directors  in the aggregate  beneficially held of our outstanding common stock as of december  these stockholders  if acting together  can influence significantly all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
we expect the price of our common stock to remain volatile  making it difficult for our stockholders to predict the return on their investment 
since our initial public offering  the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in response to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including changes in market valuation of software and internet companies  quarterly variations in our operating results  global and domestic economic conditions  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  announcements that we or our competitors make related to significant contracts  acquisitions  capital commitments  strategic partnerships or product introductions or enhancements  additions or departures of key personnel  stock market price and volume fluctuations  which are particularly volatile among securities of software and internet companies  and sales of significant amounts of our common stock or other securities in the open market 
the market for technology and internet related companies has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
provisions of our charter and bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts that might be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
we are subject to the provisions of delaware law  which restrict business combinations with interested stockholders  which may have the effect of inhibiting a non negotiated merger or other business combinations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to our investment portfolio  which at december  included fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately million 
the values of these securities are likely to decline if interest rates increase 
however  due to the short maturities of our investments  an immediate percent change in interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on our near term financial condition or results of operations 
foreign exchange risk our operations are conducted primarily in the united states and are denominated in united states dollars 
a small but growing portion of our sales originate through our european subsidiary and are denominated in pounds sterling 
the company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge our european balance sheet 
gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the consolidated statement of operations at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized 
because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange contracts generally offset the related effect on the underlying items being hedged  use of these instruments is not expected to subject the company to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
net foreign currency gain and loss did not have a material effect on our results of operations in  or forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transactions ie pounds sterling  and the terms of the forward exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying transactions 
the effect of an immediate percent change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not expected to be material to our near term financial condition or results of operations
