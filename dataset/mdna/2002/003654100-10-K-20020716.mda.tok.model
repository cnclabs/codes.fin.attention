part i item business overview abiomed is a leading developer  manufacturer and marketer of medical products designed to safely and effectively assist or replace the pumping function of the failing heart 
in july   initial human clinical trials commenced in the us for our abiocor implantable replacement heart 
the abiocor is the world s first battery powered implantable replacement heart system 
the abiocor  the development of which follows decades of fundamental and applied research  development and testing  is intended to extend life and provide an improved quality of life for end stage heart failure patients 
the initial clinical trial of the abiocor in the us has commenced at four among six initial medical teams approved by the us food and drug administration  known as the fda 
clinical testing of the abiocor is anticipated to commence at select medical centers in europe during  subject to applicable regulatory approvals 
we currently manufacture and sell the bvs  a fda approved heart assist device 
the bvs is the most widely used advanced heart assist device for the temporary treatment of all patients with failing but potentially recoverable hearts in the us 
we are also engaged in research and development relating to other devices to replace or support the pumping function of the heart 
one such focused effort is towards further developing replacement heart technology acquired by us in from the pennsylvania state university  the penn state heart 
the penn state heart has a drive mechanism that is different than the abiocor design 
the penn state heart is  in addition to the abiocor  the only other implantable heart system to survive the rigor of the replacement heart development program funded by the us national heart lung and blood institute  the nhlbi 
development of the abiocor and the penn state heart reinforces our commitment to providing the best solutions for end stage heart failure patients in need of a replacement heart 
our abiocor is a heart replacement device that replaces the failing ventricles of a patient s diseased heart and takes over the heart s blood pumping function 
it is designed for use in patients at risk of imminent death due to irreparably damaged hearts  but whose other vital organs remain viable 
we believe the abiocor will provide a much needed treatment option for those patients in the us for whom there is currently no effective therapy available 
if and when approved by applicable us and international regulatory authorities  we anticipate that we should be able to sell the first generation abiocor systems for approximately  each  subject to the establishment of reimbursement levels by third party payers 
to date  more than million have been invested in the development and testing of the abiocor  including over million in funding from the nhlbi 
we have built a pilot scale manufacturing facility for the abiocor 
we have over employees working on the abiocor program  including over engineers  scientists and other technically educated personnel 
we are collaborating with leading medical centers and healthcare professionals 
our bvs is a bridge to recovery device that can temporarily assume the full pumping function of the heart for patients with potentially reversible heart failure 
it is intended for use in patients whose hearts can recover within a period of up to fourteen days 
in  the bvs became the first heart assist device capable of providing full circulatory support to be approved by the fda 
the bvs is the most widely used fda approved temporary heart assist device  and to date has been used to support thousands of patients at over medical centers worldwide 
the bvs  which primarily consists of single use external blood pumps  cannulae and drive and control consoles  has been a profitable product line since fiscal we believe our experience in developing  manufacturing and selling the bvs will provide us with a competitive advantage in commercializing the abiocor  as well as other future products 
our penn state heart is intended to serve end stage heart failure patients similar to those addressed by the abiocor 
we have designed the current version of the penn state heart to be smaller than the current clinical version of the abiocor 
the penn state heart is in a pre clinical development and testing stage 
our focused research and development related to the abiocor  bvs and the penn state heart has provided us with the proprietary technology  know how and experience to develop additional products 
we believe we are the only company in the world with technical background and expertise in the full range of technology to support the pumping function of the heart 
we believe that there are many opportunities to apply our expertise to address the needs of heart failure patients 
we seek to be first to market with high quality and cost effective technologies for heart failure patients who currently lack adequate therapies

industry overview the human heart the human heart is the pump for the body s circulatory system 
the heart has four chambers the left and the right atria and the left and the right ventricles 
the two atria serve as the inflow chambers of the heart  collecting blood for delivery to the ventricles 
the ventricles are the pumping chambers of the heart  pumping blood to the lungs and the rest of the body 
the right ventricle of the heart pumps oxygen depleted blood returning from the body to the lungs where it is re oxygenated 
the left ventricle receives oxygen rich blood returning from the lungs and pumps it back to the rest of the body 
the chambers of the heart are formed of muscle tissue known as myocardium 
the coronary arteries  a specialized network of blood vessels within the heart  provide oxygen and other nutrients to the heart itself 
the human heart has four valves that help ensure that blood flows in the proper direction into and out of the ventricles as they are repeatedly filled and then discharged with the pumping of blood 
the timing and rate at which the heart beats  referred to as its rhythm  is controlled by electrical impulses in the conduction system of the heart 
heart disease heart disease has been responsible for more than  deaths per year in the us it is the number one cause of death in the us  responsible for more deaths than all forms of cancer combined 
illnesses and deaths from heart disease create an immense burden to many individuals and their families 
patients frequently experience extended suffering  and the economic cost is substantial 
while a number of therapies exist for the treatment of patients in early stages of heart disease  limited therapies exist today for most patients with severe  end stage  heart failure 
the majority of deaths from heart disease can be attributed to coronary heart disease  or chd  and congestive heart failure  or chf 
other types of heart disease include rhythm disorders and diseases of the valves 
chd is a disease of the coronary arteries causing reduced blood flow and insufficient oxygen delivery to the affected portion of the heart 
chd can lead to a heart attack  also known as an acute myocardial infarction  resulting in permanent damage to the heart muscle 
in severe heart attacks  death can occur suddenly or gradually over days and weeks 
chf is a condition resulting from the progressive deterioration of the heart over extended periods of time 
the patient s heart cannot provide adequate blood flow and oxygen to meet the needs of the body 
chf may be initiated and aggravated by a variety of factors  including high blood pressure  defective heart valves  chd  infections of the heart muscle or the valves and heart problems resulting from heart defects 
due to the progressive nature of chf  medical interventions often take place over periods of months or years 
in general  heart failure is progressive 
while approximately half of all heart failure patients experience sudden death as a result of cardiac arrest  the remaining patients who die from heart failure typically do so in hospitals or long term care facilities 
prevalence and mortality the number of patients both suffering and dying from heart disease has been rising on an annual basis 
statistics indicate that there are over million people with chd and over million people with chf in the us  with similar incidence outside the us approximately half of the approximate  deaths from heart disease in the us were sudden deaths 
of the deaths that did not occur suddenly  most were associated with chd and approximately with chf 
current therapies to support these patients are inadequate because they cannot stop the progression of the disease 
we believe that a significant number of such chd and chf patients could benefit from our abiocor and our penn state heart 
therapies for heart disease a broad spectrum of treatment is available for heart failure patients 
treatments include drug therapies  cardiological interventions  including closed chest procedures and rhythm management therapies  or surgical corrections  such as coronary bypass surgery and valve replacement 
for patients with end stage heart disease  however  these treatments are typically inadequate 
patients with severe heart disease frequently are in need of heart replacement 
because the supply of available donor hearts is limited  with fewer than  per year available in the us  heart assist and replacement treatments have been and continue to be developed with the goal of extending and improving the lives of these patients 
devices for circulatory support treatments circulatory support treatments can be divided into two categories a destination therapies  including heart replacement and permanent heart assist devices  and b temporary heart assist devices 
destination therapy 
devices intended to be within or attached to patients for their remaining lives are classified as destination therapies 
destination therapy devices consist of replacement hearts and permanent assist devices  including quality of life support devices that provide partial support to the heart on a permanent basis 
heart replacement 
the goal of heart replacement  whether with a donor heart or a mechanical device  is to replace the failing human heart with a viable alternative 
patients with irreparably damaged hearts who are facing imminent death due to chd or severe chf are potential candidates for heart replacement provided that their other vital organs remain viable 
the supply of human donor hearts is currently inadequate to meet the needs of these patients and no device is yet approved for use in these patients 
we believe that tens of thousands of patients per year  out of more than  potential patients  might eventually benefit from an implantable replacement heart once it is proven safe  effective and reliable 
the fewer than  patients saved by heart transplant in the us annually represent a fraction of those that might be returned to a normal life if a greater supply of donor hearts or alternative therapy were available 
in addition  a significant portion of heart transplant patients must endure a long waiting period before a suitable donor heart is identified  if at all 
the development of an implantable mechanical heart could help alleviate this long and difficult wait 
no heart replacement device has yet been approved for commercial use as a destination device 
the abiocor is the first heart replacement device to commence clinical trials for this purpose 
permanent heart assist 
permanent assist devices are being developed to supplement the function of the diseased heart or to stop or slow the progression of the disease  while leaving the diseased heart in place 
these devices contrast with replacement hearts  which are intended to replace a severely and irreversibly damaged heart 
a number of companies are developing permanent heart assist devices  some of which are in clinical trials in the us and overseas 
certain of these assist devices are in advanced stages of clinical testing and pursuing regulatory approval 
one implantable left ventricular assist device has received recommendation from a fda advisory panel as approvable  subject to certain conditions  but no assist device has yet been approved in the us for commercial use as a destination device 
permanent assist devices under development can be grouped into two categories those that pump blood directly  known as ventricular assist devices or vads  and less invasive devices that are intended to help the heart without the risk of directly contacting flowing blood 
the less invasive devices include those that wrap around the heart  either to help the heart pump blood or to inhibit deterioration of the heart by preventing its further enlargement  and those that attempt to synchronize the actions of the heart ventricles with electrical impulses 
we believe that all types of permanent heart assist devices potentially may be used to treat certain heart failure patients who are near death as well as those patients who are not at imminent risk of death but whose daily activities are significantly restricted due to their weakened hearts 
vads  the more invasive of the two categories  may prove the most appropriate permanent heart assist devices for certain end stage chf patients 
implantable vads are intended primarily for patients with severe left ventricular failure 
we believe that vads are being primarily developed for chf patients and that vads would not be appropriate for long term support of a very large fraction of heart failure patients  including those with massive heart damage  severe rhythm disorders  blood clots in the ventricles  severe lung disease  ventricular rupture  chronic right ventricular failure or heart transplant rejection 
temporary heart assist 
candidates for temporary heart assist devices include patients with severe but potentially reversible heart failure and patients whose hearts need help pumping blood while they await transplantation or other therapies 
temporary heart assist devices typically consist of a specialized pump that is attached to a patient s heart and driven by a console or powered by an external battery pack 
such devices are intended to be removed from a patient s body once the patient s heart has had the opportunity to recover its normal function or the heart is replaced 
temporary heart assist devices can be grouped into three categories bridge to recovery 
bridge to recovery devices are used to support patients with potentially reversible failing hearts 
these devices are most frequently used to support patients whose hearts do not fully restart following open heart surgery  and who cannot be weaned off the heart lung machine 
of the patients who experience such complications  many thousands die each year whose lives could potentially be saved with a temporary assist device as a bridge to recovery 
bridge to recovery devices temporarily assume the pumping function of the heart  while allowing the heart to rest  heal and recover its normal function 
these devices can also be used for patients who have not undergone surgery but whose lives are threatened by viral infections that attack the heart muscle 
in addition  bridge to recovery devices may prove beneficial to certain patients who have suffered from a recent heart attack 
bridge to transplant 
bridge to transplant devices are used to support patients who have experienced life threatening heart disease and are awaiting heart transplantation 
we believe that the market for this category of device is limited by the availability of qualified donor hearts 
staging 
staging devices are used to support patients before or during application of other therapies and to support patients with failing hearts being transported to other facilities 
at present  for reasons of specialized care  patients are transported between medical centers with the assistance of such devices under hospital guidelines 
in the future  staging devices may be used to support heart failure patients prior to implantation of a permanent heart assist device or a heart replacement 
these devices could help stabilize the patient and provide the medical team with time to better assess the patient s condition before selecting an appropriate therapy 
in addition  while bridge to recovery devices are approved and used today to assist heart transplant patients when rejection occurs  in the future staging devices may be used with transplant patients who have rejected their donor heart and need life support before receiving an implantable replacement heart 
abiomed products and products under development our current commercial product line is the bvs 
our primary products under development are the abiocor system and the penn state heart 
each of these products are systems  or product lines  that consist of various component products 
in addition  we are in the early stages of research and development of other potential products for heart failure patients 
the abiocor implantable replacement heart the abiocor is a battery powered totally implantable replacement heart system 
the abiocor is referred to as totally implantable because it has been designed to operate primarily on portable external battery power  without wires or any other material penetrating the patient s skin 
the abiocor is referred to as a replacement heart because it has been designed for implantation in the space vacated by the removal of a patient s diseased ventricles  where it will take over the full pumping function of the heart 
the abiocor is intended for use as destination therapy by patients with irreparably damaged hearts who are at risk of imminent death due to chd or severe chf but whose other vital organs remain viable 
in  we began to receive funding for abiocor development from the national heart  lung and blood institute  known as the nhlbi  to support our development and testing of the abiocor 
we have maintained this support through the research phase of our abiocor development program by achieving various designated milestones 
the nhlbi has provided over million of the more than million that has been invested to date for the development of the abiocor 
design of the abiocor 
the following diagram illustrates the principal components of the abiocor 

graphic 
the abiocor system consists of the following principal components a thoracic unit  or replacement heart  which includes two artificial ventricles with their associated valves and a hydraulic pumping system 
the unit weighs approximately two pounds and provides complete blood circulation to the lungs and the rest of the body 
the ventricles and their associated valves have seamless surfaces made from our blood contacting material  angioflex  and special geometries with flow patterns designed to reduce the risk of blood cell damage and blood clots 
our current configuration of the thoracic unit is sized for patients with relatively large chest cavities 
if our testing of this configuration is successful  we plan to develop thoracic units of different sizes to fit a larger portion of the patients who might benefit from a replacement heart 
a rechargeable internal battery  that is implanted beneath the skin in the abdomen of abiocor recipients and allows the abiocor to operate without any external power supply for limited periods of time 
a microprocessor based internal electronic device  or controller  that is implanted beneath the skin in the abdomen of abiocor recipients and controls and monitors the thoracic unit and provides radio communication with an external monitor affording patients and caregivers the opportunity for real time information on its operating status 
an across the skin  or transcutaneous  energy transmission system  which eliminates the need for wires penetrating the patient s skin and the inherent associated risks of infection 
it transfers the power to operate the abiocor system and to recharge the implantable battery without tethering the patient to an external drive console 
this system includes an internal energy coil that is implanted beneath the skin and an external coil that is aligned in proximity to the internal coil but resides outside the skin 
the external coil emits power that is received by the internal coil 
an external rechargeable battery pack and monitor designed to be worn by the patient 
these components supply primary power to the system  allow patient mobility  provide system diagnostic information  and recharge the implanted back up battery as needed 
the abiocor design is intended to preserve life and to restore the quality of a patient s life to an acceptable level 
restoration of the quality of a patient s life means that the patient should be able to return to a comfortable lifestyle  free from pain  with good mental acuity and an ability to carry out everyday activities 
among the quality of life features of the abiocor design are quiet heart valves  no penetration of the skin  no tethering to a large external drive console and no need for immuno suppression therapies 
the abiocor system is designed for both low maintenance and low patient involvement 
however  during our ongoing initial clinical trial of the first generation abiocor  patients have largely remained under sustained medical supervision in the hospital and have more frequently used a portable monitoring device in lieu of the patient carried external battery pack and electronics until such time as their health has recovered and a greater degree of independence has been demonstrated 
in addition  we are using a conservative anti coagulation regimen and imposing greater limits on patient activities until we gain more clinical experience  especially in the home setting 
we have also created tools and methods intended to make the abiocor system easier to implant 
these tools include quick connectors for relatively easy attachment of the abiocor to the human anatomy and a virtual surgery software tool to allow for the simulated implant of the abiocor into a three dimensional anatomical computerized model of a particular patient prior to opening that patient s chest 
initial clinical trial 
in our initial clinical trial we are seeking to determine whether the first generation abiocor can effectively and safely extend life with acceptable quality of life for patients who are otherwise likely to die within thirty days and who have no other life saving option 
the results of this initial fifteen patient trial will allow us to better assess our status with regard to obtaining regulatory approval to commercially market and sell the abiocor for an initial subset of patients in the us in january  we received fda permission under an investigational device exemption ide to begin the initial human clinical trial in five patients 
under the terms of the ide  our initial trial consists of a total of fifteen patients divided into three groups of five each with expansion to each successive group of five patients if the day experience of patients with the abiocor is satisfactory to the fda 
patients can be included in this initial clinical trial only if they have bi ventricular heart failure  are more than eighteen years old  have a predictably high likelihood of dying within the next days  are unresponsive to maximum existing therapies  are ineligible for heart transplantation and are sufficiently large physiologically for the abiocor to fit and operate adequately 
patients are to be excluded from the clinical trial if their heart failure has a significant potential of being reversible  if they are pregnant  have serious psychiatric illness or an inadequate social support system 
patients may also be excluded if they are suffering from other serious non cardiac medical ailments 
in july  doctors at jewish hospital in louisville  kentucky performed the world s first implantation of our abiocor implantable replacement heart 
as of july  seven implantations of the abiocor had been attempted in critically ill patients meeting the criteria for the clinical trial 
five of these implantations were successful with four of the five patients living on abiocor support for more than the initial goal of days ie more than twice their expected life expectancy without the abiocor  three of the patients recovered well enough to take excursions outside the hospitals  two of the patients were discharged from the hospital to intermediate facilities and one of these was discharged and released to his home 
as of july   two of these patients are alive 
one of these two is living comfortably at home with his family with routine  weekly check up visits at the hospital 
he has been supported by the abiocor for over ten months implanted on september  
the second of these two patients has been readmitted to the hospital and is being treated for a recurring respiratory condition 
he has been supported for over eight months implanted on november  
in november  under the terms of the fda approval for the trial  we were allowed to proceed with the second group of five patients 
we also have been preparing to commence clinical testing of the abiocor in a few selected clinical sites in europe 
we are focusing on learning as much as possible from the experience of each patient to benefit successive patients 
considerable amounts have been learned about the implant of the abiocor and the subsequent care of these patients 
we are also ensuring that prospective patients are well informed about the risks of the clinical trial 
this process has contributed to all of the patients thus far enrolled in the trial being patients with various forms of chf as opposed to patients dying from more acute events such chd 
although pre existing non cardiac conditions have made the care of these patients more challenging and their hospital stays longer  the abiocor s ability to provide normal bi ventricular blood circulation appears to have helped alleviate some of these conditions in some of these patients 
while we do not yet have a sufficient number of patients to draw statistically meaningful conclusions  we are very encouraged by the early results of the abiocor clinical trial 
as of july   the duration of support for the five patients supported by the abiocor have ranged from to days  including and days for the two patients who remain alive on abiocor support 
in a cumulative total of approximately patient years of support  the mechanical operation of the abiocor system has been highly reliable  providing appropriate circulatory support without any clinically significant malfunction 
all of the patients supported by the abiocor have lived beyond what would otherwise have been predicted  and the majority have made reference to improved quality of life despite ups and downs during their post operative recovery course 
none of the patients experienced device related infection or sepsis 
three patients have experienced strokes of uncertain origin 
two of these strokes were serious and one was relatively minor that led to recovery 
among the potential causes of those strokes could be contact of atrial tissue with a structural element on the surgical cuff used to surgically attach the patients atria to the abiocor  the inability to maintain target anticoagulation regimens in some of these patients because of their severely compromised pre operative status or a combination of the two 
both of these potential issues are being addressed to help mitigate the likelihood of stroke for future patients 
post mortem examination of the abiocor thoracic units explanted from the three deceased patients that had been supported with the abiocor did not exhibit evidence of clinically significant thrombus formation within the device itself  suggesting  we believe  that the blood pumps have performed as designed and were likely not contributing factors for those patients who experienced strokes 
success of the initial clinical trial will be evaluated based upon periodic review of the survival of abiocor patients and their quality of life as measured by a variety of assessment criteria 
as we gain clinical experience with the most seriously ill patients and demonstrate clinical efficacy and safety  we expect to enhance the performance range  durability and reliability of abiocor systems and plan to seek regulatory approval for current and subsequent generations of the abiocor for use in imminently dying patients and in increasingly broad patient populations and with longer intended durations 
such regulatory approval will likely require clinical data and trials beyond this initial trial 
this regulatory plan is consistent with our experience with the bvs system 
while the abiocor is designed as a permanent replacement for the failing heart  the abiocor today is a first generation device that will likely require improvement over time to incorporate feedback from its clinical use 
the patients that will be initially treated with the abiocor will be relatively large framed adults who are near death and for whom the abiocor represents the only potential viable alternative to death 
we have tested the abiocor extensively 
the results of such testing were part of our ide submission to the fda from which we gained permission to commence initial clinical trials 
we believe that for patients ill enough to qualify for the initial clinical trial  the first generation abiocor presents the best alternative to potentially extend their lives and to provide them with an acceptable quality of life 
however  we understand that this patient category represents only a fraction of the potential patients who might benefit annually from the abiocor 
our clinical and regulatory strategy of continuing to improve the abiocor based on clinical experience is intended to allow us to demonstrate that the abiocor can provide patients with a reasonable quality of life for sustained periods of time 
we believe that demonstration of this capability is needed for eventual use of the product in end stage heart failure patients who are not as ill as is required to qualify for our initial clinical trial 
cost effectiveness 
we are developing the abiocor with the intent to eventually offer a cost effective treatment for end stage heart failure patients 
in addition  the abiocor has the potential to allow patients an opportunity to return to productive lives 
this would allow the medical system to save money by discharging the patient from the hospital and allowing the person to become productive and lead a reasonably normal life 
if the safety  effectiveness and durability of the abiocor are clinically demonstrated for multiple year durations  it has the potential to be less expensive than heart transplantation over a five year period 
one reason for this reduced cost is that recipients of a mechanical replacement heart are not expected to need immuno suppression drugs 
the blood and tissue contacting portions of the abiocor are constructed of inert materials  which are not expected to elicit a response from a patient s immune system 
other cost savings could result because the patients can receive a replacement heart sooner and would not require extensive tests and biopsies to assess donor heart compatibility 
while recipients of the abiocor will need to purchase new batteries periodically  we anticipate that the annual comparative cost of battery purchases will be significantly less than the cost of immuno suppression drugs required by donor heart recipients 
while developing the abiocor  we introduced the bvs  a temporary heart assist device  which is currently being sold in the us and international markets 
certain key elements of the technology developed for the abiocor  especially the blood contacting material  angioflex  have been clinically tested in the bvs and are currently in commercial use 
in addition  the bvs has enabled us to develop significant experience in areas such as research and development  manufacturing  regulatory compliance  clinical support and sales and marketing 
we believe our experience with the bvs in these areas will provide us with a competitive advantage in commercializing the abiocor 
the bvs temporary heart assist device the bvs was the first heart assist device capable of assuming the full pumping function of the heart to be approved by the fda  and is the most widely used heart assist device today  with thousands of patients supported to date 
it is a bridge to recovery device designed to provide a patient s failing heart with full circulatory assistance while allowing the heart to rest  heal and recover its function 
the bvs can support the left  right or both ventricles of the heart 
the average age of patients supported with the bvs is  however the bvs has been used to support patients as young as and as old as years old 
the bvs is the only device that the fda has approved for the temporary treatment of all categories of patients with failing but potentially recoverable hearts 
the bvs is most frequently used in patients whose hearts fail to recover function immediately following heart surgery 
the fda approved the bvs through its rigorous pre market approval process for use with these post surgical patients in november in  the fda approved use of the bvs for all other categories of post surgical patients with potentially reversible heart failure 
in  the fda approved use of the bvs on patients who  prior to bvs insertion  are non surgical patients with abrupt heart failure as a result of viral attack of the heart or certain heart attacks  expanding its use to the temporary treatment of all patients with potentially reversible heart failure 
we market and sell the bvs system in europe under a ce mark and in we received regulatory approval to market and sell the bvs in japan 
the following diagram illustrates the principal components of the bvs 

graphic 
the bvs system consists of the following components single use external blood pumps  which provide pumping of blood for the left  right or both sides of a patient s heart and are designed to emulate the function of the natural heart  cannulae  which are specially designed tubes used to connect the blood pumps to a patient s heart  and a computer controlled pneumatic drive and control console  which automatically adjusts the pumping rate to meet the basic needs of the patient 
the integration of the cannulae  blood pumps and console creates an external heart system with the ability to reduce the load on the heart  provide pulsatile blood flow to vital organs and allow the heart muscles time to rest and recover 
the bvs is designed to be easy to use and does not require a specially trained technician constantly to monitor or adjust the pumping parameters 
the bvs is designed to facilitate the recovery of patients hearts as quickly as possible 
patients who recover under bvs support typically stabilize in a period of less than one week 
it generally takes three to five days for the damaged but recoverable heart muscle to restore its function in a post cardiotomy patient 
while the bvs has been used to support some patients for weeks or months  the bvs is not intended nor approved for long term use 
the bvs  although it is an external vad  serves a different function than bridge to transplant devices  which are intended for long term use by patients awaiting a heart transplant 
the bvs is most frequently used to support patients who have undergone open heart surgery  when the heart cannot be successfully restarted and weaned off the heart lung machine used in surgery 
the bvs can assume the full pumping function of the heart for these patients while reducing certain risks associated with extended support on the heart lung machine  including bleeding  strokes and blood cell damage 
the traditional therapy for these patients has been the combined use of drugs and intra aortic balloon pumps 
intra aortic balloon pumps are capable of providing limited enhancement to the pumping function of a failing heart 
despite the availability of such therapy  many thousands of these patients die each year 
other categories of patients who can be supported by the bvs include those suffering from viral myocarditis  a viral infection of the heart 
for these patients  the bvs assumes the full pumping function of the heart  allowing the patient s immune system to defend against the virus 
other uses of the bvs include supporting patients following failed heart transplants and supporting the right ventricle of a patient s heart in conjunction with the implantation of a device to assist the left ventricle 
the bvs is typically used when the patient s chances for survival are small 
we are also exploring other potential applications of the bvs  including its use as a staging device to support heart failure patients prior to a permanent heart assist device or heart replacement 
any hospital performing open chest heart surgery may use the bvs 
there are approximately of these hospitals in the us and more than  such hospitals outside the us as of march   more than medical centers in the us had purchased the bvs  including of the major us centers that perform more than heart surgeries annually 
in marketing the bvs  we are focusing on selling additional consoles and disposable blood pumps to existing customers with significant but less emphasis on adding new customers 
approximately of current bvs revenues are derived from sales of bvs single use blood pumps to existing customers 
our us list prices for the bvs system are  for a bvs single use blood pump and cannulae set and  for a bvs console 
since the bvs received its initial fda approval  we have made various improvements to the bvs system  primarily to make it easier to use 
we continue to enhance the bvs product line and are developing improved blood pumps  cannulae and consoles 
in may  we received pre market supplemental approval from the fda to begin selling our bvs t transport backup console 
this new console allows for transport of a patient by ambulance or aircraft between hospitals as necessary in order to expand patient care 
we believe this and other pending improvements may permit use of the bvs for additional patient conditions 
the penn state heart the penn state heart  like the abiocor  is a battery powered totally implantable replacement heart system intended for use as destination therapy by patients with irreparably damaged hearts who are at risk of imminent death due to chd or severe chf but whose other vital organs remain viable 
we acquired the technology rights to the penn state heart in  subject to reversion to the pennsylvania state university on or before september if we do not make a reasonable effort to commercialize this technology 
similar to the abiocor  the development of the penn state heart was supported by significant funding from the nhlbi 
the abiocor and the penn state heart were the only two replacement heart programs that achieved the technological progress needed to qualify for the final pre clinical rounds of funding from the nhlbi 
the penn state heart is currently in an advanced stage of pre clinical development 
we are developing this device in collaboration with the scientific team at the pennsylvania state university 
the penn state heart  like the abiocor  consists of various subsystems including a thoracic unit  rechargeable implantable battery  microprocessor based implantable electronic device  transcutaneous energy transmission system and external rechargeable battery pack and monitor 
the key differentiation between the current design of the abiocor and the penn state heart is in the thoracic unit 
in areas other than the thoracic unit  effort has been made to utilize abiocor subsystems where possible 
the pumping mechanism in the penn state heart s thoracic unit consists of two artificial ventricles but is constructed and actuated differently than in the abiocor 
we believe that the penn state heart and the abiocor each has its unique advantages 
the combination strengthens abiomed s position to continue to lead in the introduction of heart replacement technologies 
it is our intention to continue to develop the penn state heart in an effort to determine which device is more suitable for the different classes of end stage heart failure patients in need of heart replacement 
we may find that each is best for certain subsets of patients or that certain features of the two technologies should be combined to produce a better device 
other products and technologies under development we are using the technology and know how derived from the abiocor and the bvs in the research and development of other potential cardiovascular products 
we are also using our experience and commitment to this field to evaluate potential collaborative arrangements relating to third party technologies and products 
other new technologies are in various stages of research  development or evaluation  and include passive and active heart wraps as well as specialized implantable and external heart assist devices 
in addition  research and development activities under our product development programs incorporate certain technologies that have potential as separate spin off products 
examples include implantable monitoring systems with remote transmission capability software for virtual surgery  non invasive power transmission systems  and external monitoring systems 
research and product development as of march   our research and development staff consisted of professional and technical personnel  including with phds  and engineers  many with advanced degrees  covering disciplines such as electronics  mechanics  software  reliability engineering  fluid mechanics  physics  materials and physiology 
included among the employees are employees engaged in the pilot manufacturing and quality testing of abiocor systems 
all of the abiocor systems manufactured are being used for our ongoing initial clinical trial  testing and other investigational purposes 
none of the abiocor systems manufactured are available currently nor approved for commercial sale 
our research and development efforts are focused on mechanical heart assist and heart replacement  and the continued enhancement of the bvs and related technologies 
interaction continues with the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies to obtain the necessary clearances and approvals for our products 
sophisticated but established tools  such as three dimensional computer aided design systems are used to permit smooth transition of new designs from research to product development and into manufacturing 
we have substantial expertise in electro mechanical systems  cardiac physiology and experimental surgery  blood material interactions  fluid mechanics and hemodynamics  internal and external electronic hardware  battery technology  software  plastics processing  lasers  and optical physics 
our expertise has been primarily focused on addressing challenges associated with the safe and effective pumping of blood 
we expended  and million on research and development in fiscal  and  respectively 
these amounts included  and million  respectively  for abiocor development and testing and million in fiscal for the company s acquisition of technology and marketing rights to the penn state heart 
since our inception  us government agencies  particularly the nhlbi  have provided significant support to our product development efforts when such products are in their early stages of research and development 
as of march   our total backlog of research and development contracts and grants was million 
all of these contracts and grants contain provisions making them terminable at the convenience of the government 
sales  clinical support  marketing and field service we believe that the sales  clinical support  marketing and field service teams established for the bvs product line and the relationships developed with existing customers will be instrumental not only in continuing to expand bvs usage and sales  but also in launching new products such as the abiocor and the penn state heart 
the bvs is sold in the us through direct sales and clinical support teams 
as of march   our worldwide bvs sales  clinical support  marketing and field service teams included full time employees 
our sales force primarily focuses on increasing sales from expanded usage of bvs disposable blood pumps by our large installed base of customers as well as from initial and upgrade sales to new and existing customers 
our clinical support group focuses on training and educating new and existing customers in order to help improve clinical outcomes 
we believe that the efforts of our clinical support group contribute significantly to the number of lives saved by physicians using the bvs 
this in turn promotes usage and reorders of bvs single use blood pumps 
approximately of bvs revenues in fiscal were derived from sales of bvs single use blood pumps to existing customers 
we believe that the reputation and customer relationships of our sales and support teams will be key assets for the introduction of future products such as the abiocor  the penn state heart and bvs product extensions and other products under development 
building on our experience in the us  we have expanded our international sales efforts  both for the bvs and in preparation for the abiocor 
our international bvs product sales increased by million  or  during the fiscal year ended march  in october we received approval from the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare to market and sell the bvs system in japan 
we conduct our international sales efforts through distributors and by selling directly in selected european markets through abiomed bv  our wholly owned subsidiary located in the netherlands 
manufacturing we have over years of experience in the manufacture of the bvs console  bvs blood pumps  certain cannulae and related accessories 
as of march   our bvs manufacturing and quality assurance team consisted of people 
the manufacture of our bvs blood pumps and consoles includes assembly  testing and quality control 
key blood contacting components for the bvs blood pumps  including valves and bladders are manufactured from our proprietary angioflex polymer 
we purchase a majority of the raw materials  parts and peripheral components used in the bvs consoles 
depending on the size and design of the cannulae  they are either purchased or manufactured by us 
as of march   people in our research and development group were engaged in abiocor pilot manufacturing  process improvement and related quality assurance 
the production of the abiocor is based on some processes that are similar to the processes used for the bvs 
we produce the majority of the abiocor blood contacting components in our facility and all such components are assembled in house 
a majority of the metallic mechanical parts  electronic components and batteries used to produce the abiocor are purchased 
we contract with third parties to manufacture certain of the electronic systems used in the abiocor and we are increasingly moving such manufacturing to third parties 
in  we moved our abiocor pilot manufacturing to a new facility that includes a state of the art cleanroom area dedicated to abiocor production 
we also moved our bvs console manufacturing to a dedicated area in this new facility in in  we completed moving all of our manufacturing operations to this new facility  including moving our bvs blood pump and cannulae manufacturing operations to a new state of the art cleanroom manufacturing area 
we believe this new facility gives us the physical capacity to produce sufficient quantities of abiocor systems throughout the period of our clinical trials as well as produce sufficient quantities of bvs disposable blood pumps and cannulae to meet market demand for the foreseeable future 
our bvs manufacturing area is iso certified and operates under the fda s current quality systems regulations and good manufacturing practices  known as qsr gmp 
our abiocor manufacturing areas are iso certified and we are taking steps towards ensuring that our abiocor manufacturing area is qsr gmp compliant for purposes of eventual commercial distribution of abiocor  subject to regulatory approvals 
proprietary rights  patents and know how we have developed significant know how and proprietary technology  upon which our business depends 
to protect our know how and proprietary technology  we rely on trade secret laws  patents  copyrights  trademarks  and confidentiality agreements and contracts 
however  these methods afford only limited protection 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information  gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology without our approval 
a substantial portion of our intellectual property rights relating to the abiocor  the penn state heart and the bvs is in the form of trade secrets  rather than patents 
we protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge in part through confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
we cannot assure that our trade secrets will not become known to or be independently developed by our competitors 
as of july   we own us issued patents  including related to the abiocor  related to the penn state heart  and related to the bvs 
we also own a number of corresponding patents in a limited number of foreign countries 
our patents may not provide us with competitive advantages 
they may also be challenged by third parties 
our pending or future patent applications may not be approved 
the patents of others may render our patents obsolete or otherwise have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business 
because foreign patents may afford less protection than us patents  they may not adequately protect our proprietary information 
the medical device industry is characterized by a large number of patents and by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation 
our products and technologies could infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties 
if third parties successfully assert infringement or other claims against us  we may not be able to sell our products 
in addition  patent or intellectual property disputes or litigation may be costly  result in product development delays  or divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel 
if any such disputes or litigation arise  we may seek to enter into a royalty or licensing arrangement 
however  such an arrangement may not be available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
we may decide  in the alternative  to litigate the claims or to design around the patented or otherwise proprietary technology 
the government may obtain certain rights to use or disclose technical data developed under government contracts that supported the development of some of our products 
we retain the right to obtain patents on any inventions developed under those contracts subject to a non exclusive  non transferable  royalty free license to the government  provided we follow prescribed procedures 
competition competition among providers of treatments for the failing heart is intense and subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards 
many of the companies developing or marketing cardiovascular products have substantially greater or broader financial  product development  sales and marketing resources and experience than abiomed 
these competitors may develop superior products or products of similar quality at the same or lower prices 
moreover  improvements in current or new technologies may make them technically equivalent or superior to our products in addition to providing cost or other advantages 
other advances in medical technology  biotechnology and pharmaceuticals may reduce the size of the potential markets for our products or render those products obsolete 
no implantable replacement heart is commercially available today 
we are aware of other heart replacement device development efforts in the us  canada  europe and japan but are not aware of any plans for any other totally implantable replacement heart to commence clinical trials in the us or anywhere in the world 
we believe that if and when other implantable replacement hearts are available  our abiocor and penn state heart will compete with them based on quality of life advantages  cost effectiveness  device reliability  clinical support and customer relationships 
in addition to the developers of implantable replacement hearts  there are a number of companies  including arrow international  thoratec corporation and world heart corporation which are developing permanent heart assist products  including implantable lvads and miniaturized rotary ventricular assist devices  that may address markets that overlap with certain segments of the markets targeted by abiocor  the bvs and the penn state heart 
abiocor and the penn state heart may compete with those devices for some patient groups  notably patients with severe chf due to predominant left ventricular heart failure 
we believe that implantable replacement hearts  lvads and other vads  if developed and proven effective for destination therapy  will generally be used to address the needs of different patient populations  with an overlap for certain segments of the heart failure population 
we believe that there is a need for both implantable lvads and implantable replacement hearts as destination therapies  and that when both technologies demonstrate the required reliability  surgeons will favor implantable replacement hearts for most chd patients and a significant fraction of chf patients 
in addition to devices being developed for patients in need of heart replacement  several companies and institutions have been for many years investigating xenotransplantation  the transplantation of a heart from another species  as a potential therapy 
most notably  some developers are investigating the use of genetically engineered pig hearts as an alternative source of donor hearts 
this technology remains in its formative stage and subject to a number of significant scientific challenges  including controlling elevated immunologic reactions leading to heightened rejection problems between cross species grafting and concerns for cross species disease transmission to the recipient and the public at large 
we believe that this technology will not achieve practical application for heart replacement for decades  if ever 
the bvs is a device that can assume the full pumping function of the heart 
the fda has approved the bvs as a bridge to recovery device for the treatment of all patients with potentially reversible heart failure 
the bvs competes with a temporary cardiac assist device from thoratec corporation  which is also capable of assuming the full pumping function of the heart and is today approved for post cardiotomy support 
the thoratec device was originally approved for bridge to transplant and bridge to transplant continues to be the primary use of the device 
in addition  the bvs competes with blood pumps  such as intra aortic balloon pumps and centrifugal pumps  that are used in medical centers for a variety of applications but which are limited to providing partial pumping support of failing hearts  are non pulsatile  or are not recommended for the duration of support generally required for bridge to recovery 
we are not aware of any other company that has applied for fda approval of a device that is directly competitive with the bvs 
approval by the fda of products that compete directly with the bvs could increase competitive pricing and other pressures 
we believe that we can compete with such products based on cost  clinical utility and customer relations 
our customers frequently have limited budgets 
as a result  our products compete against a broad range of medical devices and other therapies for these limited funds 
our success will depend in large part upon our ability to enhance our existing products  to develop new products to meet regulatory and customer requirements  and to achieve market acceptance 
we believe that important competitive factors with respect to the development and commercialization of our products include the relative speed with which we can develop products  establish clinical utility  complete clinical trials and regulatory approval processes  obtain reimbursement  and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market 
third party reimbursement we sell our bvs product and intend to sell most of our potential products under development to medical institutions 
medical institutions and their physicians typically seek reimbursement for the use of these products from third party payers  including medicare  medicaid  and private health insurers and managed care organizations 
as a result  market acceptance of our current and proposed products may depend in large part on the extent to which reimbursement is available to medical institutions and physicians for use of our products 
coverage and the level of payment provided by us and foreign third party payers varies according to a number of factors  including the medical procedure  payer  location  outcome and cost 
in the us  many private health care insurance carriers follow the recommendations of the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms  which establishes guidelines for the coverage of procedures  services and medical equipment and the payment of health care providers treating medicare patients 
internationally  healthcare reimbursement systems vary significantly 
in certain countries  medical center budgets are fixed regardless of levels of patient treatment 
in other countries  such as japan  reimbursement from government or third party payers must be applied for and approved 
as of the date of this report  the amount that medicare generally pays a medical institution for in patient care of medicare patients is based on a number of considerations  including a patient s diagnosis regardless of the services that are provided 
physicians however bill separately for the procedures that they perform 
medicare does not currently reimburse medical institutions for the incremental cost of using the bvs 
certain private health insurers and managed care providers provide incremental reimbursement to both the medical institutions and their physicians 
the u 
s 
department of health and human services has proposed  among other potential changes to the medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment system published as a notice of proposed rulemaking in the federal register on may   creation of a new diagnosis related group drg for hospital discharges involving implantation of external or implantable advanced mechanical cardiac assist devices 
if this proposal  which is subject to public comment and administrative review  is incorporated as proposed into the final rule effective october   medicare program reimbursement to hospitals for patient cases involving the bvs would be increased by approximately over the current level 
no reimbursement levels have been established for our products under development  including the abiocor 
prior to approving coverage for new medical devices  most third party payers require evidence that the product has received fda approval  european union approval  or clearance for marketing  is safe and effective and not experimental or investigational  and is medically necessary and appropriate for the specific patient for whom the product is being used 
increasing numbers of third party payers require evidence that the procedures in which the products are used  as well as the products themselves  are cost effective 
heart transplantation currently qualifies for reimbursement  as does bridge to transplant treatment with implantable vads 
comparatively  we believe that when the abiocor product reaches maturity  it should cost less over a five year period than heart transplantation today 
we believe that these factors should benefit the abiocor when our customers begin to seek reimbursement for it from third party payers 
however  we cannot assure that the abiocor or our other products under development will meet the criteria for coverage and reimbursement or that third party payers will reimburse physicians and medical institutions at levels sufficient to encourage the widespread use of the products 
if the abiocor receives such coverage  it will likely be reimbursed as an implantable prosthetic device  with payments subject to rules and limitation specific to such devices 
government regulation clinical trials  manufacture and sale of our products and products under development  including the bvs  abiocor and penn state heart are  or will be  subject to regulation by the fda and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies 
noncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to grant marketing approval for devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals  and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to request repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed by abiomed 
us clinical use regulations 
the bvs is classified as a class iii medical device under fda rules  as will be the abiocor and the penn state heart 
in the us  medical devices are classified into one of three classes us  class i  ii or iii based on the controls deemed necessary by the fda to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness 
class iii medical devices are subject to the most rigorous regulation 
class iii devices  which are typically life sustaining  life supporting or implantable devices  or new devices that have been found not to be substantially equivalent to legally marketed devices  must generally receive pre market approval by the fda to ensure their safety and effectiveness 
class iii devices are also subject to some of the requirements applicable to class i and class ii devices  including general controls  such as labeling  pre market notification  performance standards  post market surveillance  patient registries and adherence to qsr gmp requirements  which include testing  control and documentation requirements 
a pma application must be filed if a proposed device is a class iii device for which the fda has required pmas in order to obtain permission to market and sell the device in the us for a particular indication patient issue 
a pma application must be supported by valid scientific evidence  which typically includes extensive information including relevant bench tests  laboratory and animal studies and clinical trial data to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device 
the pma application also must contain a complete description of the device and its components  a detailed description of the methods  facilities and controls used to manufacture the device  and the proposed labeling  advertising literature and training materials 
by regulation  the fda has days to review the pma application  and during that time an advisory committee may evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda 
advisory committee reviews often occur over a significantly protracted period  and a number of devices for which fda approval has been sought have never been cleared for marketing 
in addition  modifications to a device that is the subject of an approved pma  or to its labeling or manufacturing process  may require the submission of pma supplements or new pmas and approval by the fda 
on an exception basis  the fda also provides that certain devices can be distributed for humanitarian purposes prior to gaining pma approval 
fda approval of a humanitarian device exemption is not broadly available and requires that no other available therapy exists for such indication and that adequate data be available to support that the therapy is reasonably safe  though arguably less data than for a pma 
if clinical trials of a device are required in order to obtain fda approval  the sponsor of the trial will have to file an investigational device exemption  known as an ide  application prior to commencing clinical trials 
the ide application must be supported by data  which typically include the results of animal testing performed in conformance with good laboratory practices and formal laboratory testing and documentation in accordance with appropriate design controls and scientific justification 
if the fda approves the ide application  and the institutional review boards or irbs at the institutions at which the clinical trials will be performed approve the clinical protocol and related materials  clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients  as approved by the fda 
sponsors of clinical trials are permitted to charge for investigational devices distributed in the course of the study provided that compensation does not exceed recovery of the costs of manufacture  research  development and handling 
an ide supplement must be submitted to and approved by the fda before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness or the rights  safety or welfare of human subjects 
in november  the fda approved our pma for the bvs 
in and  the fda approved the use of the bvs for additional indications  expanding its use to the treatment of all patients with potentially reversible heart failure 
in may  we received notice from the fda that the bvs had successfully concluded a required post market surveillance study 
the primary purpose of this post market surveillance study was to provide a warning system to alert the health care community to any potential problems with a device within a reasonable time of the initial marketing of the device 
post market surveillance provides clinical monitoring of the experiences with a device once it is distributed in the general population under actual conditions of use 
the abiocor is classified as a class iii device and therefore is subject to the ide and pma processes and qsr gmp requirements 
in january  the fda granted an ide providing us with regulatory permission to commence the initial clinical trial of the abiocor 
the initial clinical trial  which began on july   when doctors at jewish hospital in louisville  kentucky  performed the world s first implantation of our abiocor implantable replacement heart  is subject to periodic review and to the readiness of each collaborating medical center  including training of its surgical and post operative care teams and approval of the clinical trial protocol by the hospital s internal review board 
our clinical trial is being undertaken with patients who  despite all available therapies  have an extremely high probability of death within thirty days due to heart failure 
we anticipate seeking initial fda approval of the abiocor for a limited category of indications and patients  and subsequent approval for additional indications and patient populations 
after the initial regulatory approval  we will need to complete additional clinical testing and request supplemental approvals for additional indications and broader marketing claims 
if we obtain approval of the abiocor in this manner  the fda may initially impose restrictions on use of the abiocor 
nevertheless  we believe that this phased approach will permit us to obtain initial marketing approval for the abiocor more quickly than if we were to seek a broader approval from the outset 
us manufacturing and sales regulation 
any devices  including the bvs  which we manufacture or distribute pursuant to fda clearances or approvals  are subject to continuing regulation by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
manufacturers of medical devices for marketing in the us are required to adhere to qsr gmp requirements and must also comply with medical devices reporting  or mdr  which requires that a firm report to the fda any incident in which its product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury  or in which its product malfunctioned and  if the malfunction were to recur  it would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury 
labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and  in certain circumstances  by the federal trade commission 
current fda enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses 
we are subject to routine inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities for compliance with qsr gmp and mdr requirements  as well as other applicable regulations 
international regulation 
we are also subject to regulation in each of the foreign countries in which we sell our products 
many of the regulations applicable to our products in these counties are similar to those of the fda 
we have obtained the requisite foreign regulatory approvals for sale of the bvs in many foreign countries  including most of western europe 
we believe that foreign regulations relating to the manufacture and sale of medical devices are becoming more stringent 
the european union adopted regulations requiring that medical devices such as the bvs comply with the medical devices directive  which includes iso and ce certification 
in  we received iso and ce certification for the bvs 
in we received iso certification for the abiocor 
many manufacturers of medical devices  including abiomed  have often relied on foreign markets for the initial commercial introduction of their products 
however  an evolving foreign regulatory environment could make it more difficult  costly and time consuming for us to pursue this strategy for new products 
in the european union  implantable devices  such as the abiocor  must comply with the active implantable medical devices directive  known as aimdd  in order to obtain ce certification 
we are working toward ce certification of the abiocor 
delays in obtaining this certifications for the abiocor or other products under development on a timely basis could delay commercial sales of the products in the european union 
employees as of june   we had full time employees  including in research and development including people engaged in abiocor pilot manufacturing  in sales  clinical support  marketing and field service  and in bvs manufacturing and quality assurance 
our remaining employees work in a variety of areas  including information technology  human resources  accounting  facilities  corporate development and management 
we have entered into contractual agreements with all of our employees  which include confidentiality and non competition commitments by each and every employee at all levels 
none of our employees is represented by a union 
we consider our employee relations to be good

overview we are a leading developer  manufacturer and marketer of medical products designed to safely and effectively assist or replace the pumping function of the failing heart 
in july  in collaboration with leading medical centers  we commenced initial clinical trials for the world s first implantable  battery powered replacement heart  the abiocor 
the abiocor  which is intended for end stage heart failure patients  is designed to replace the failing ventricles of a patient s diseased heart and take over their pumping function 
the commencement of this initial clinical trial  approved by the fda under an ide  follows nearly three decades of research  development and testing related to this technology 
we currently manufacture and sell the bvs  a temporary heart assist device which was the first device approved by the fda as a bridge to recovery device for temporary treatment of all patients with failing but potentially recoverable hearts 
and  we are working to develop other products to assist or replace the heart  including development of the penn state heart 
our operating results reflect the dual activities of commercial operations and investments in the research and development of new technologies 
the bvs is a temporary heart assist device designed to assume the full pumping function of a patient s failing heart while allowing the heart to rest  heal and recover its function 
the bvs consists of single use external blood pumps and cannulae and a reusable pneumatic drive and control console 
all of our product revenues are currently derived from the bvs product line 
bvs revenues consist of sales to new customers and reorders from existing customers 
following commercial introduction of the bvs in the us  our focus was on obtaining market share beginning with the largest medical centers 
as of march   more than medical centers in the us had purchased the bvs  including of all major medical centers that perform more than heart surgeries annually 
while we continue to seek additional new customers for the bvs  our primary focus is to increase usage and product reorders by existing customers 
product reorders currently represent approximately of bvs product revenues 
during fiscal  no single customer represented more than of product revenues 
research and development is a significant portion of our operations 
our research and development efforts are focused on the development of new products  primarily related to heart assist and heart replacement  and the continued enhancement of the bvs and related technologies 
in fiscal  we incurred million in total research and development spending directed at the abiocor and million in research and development spending directed at bvs improvements  the penn state heart and development of other potential products 
these expenditures were partially offset by revenues from contracts and grants of million  of which the majority were from the nhlbi 
we retain rights to commercialize all technological discoveries and products resulting from these contracts and grants 
restatement of prior year s financial statements we have modified our methods of revenue recognition for certain sales contracts and funded research and development contracts 
such modifications result in the shifting of portions of revenues and related expenses between fiscal quarters and fiscal years 
in addition  we have modified the timing of expenses recorded in connection with our acquisition in september of rights to the penn state heart and we have recorded expense for certain non cash transactions involving stock option exercises made by employees with the assistance of the company 
accordingly  our financial results presented below for each of the two years ending on march  and have been restated from our previously audited consolidated financial statements and our financial results presented below for our year ending on march  have been revised from our previously announced fiscal results included in our press release on operating results dated may  throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and operations md a  the term previously reported will be used to refer to our previously filed financial statements for the two years ending on march  as well as our previously announced fiscal results 
the following table presents increases and decreases to our previously reported operating results for each of the three years ending on march  that resulted in the aforementioned restatements changes in previously reported amounts thousands  except per share data year ended march  revenues products   funded research and development  total revenues   costs and expenses cost of product revenues research and development internally incurred r d costs

total costs and expenses   income loss from operations   interest and other income  net net income loss   net income loss per share previously reported deferred revenues increased by million  million  and million as of march   and  respectively  as a result of the aforementioned restatements 
the increase in deferred revenue on march  is scheduled for recognition as revenue in our fiscal year that ends march  upon the earlier of shipment of product or the end of the terms of the relevant contracts 
the majority of our product revenues are derived from our shipment of products to fulfill customer orders for specified numbers of bvs consoles and blood pumps at specified prices 
we recognize revenues and record costs related to such sales upon product shipment 
a portion of our product revenues are derived from contracts which provide for the company to receive a fixed  non refundable amount of money over a set period of time in return for our providing these customers with bvs product at the start of the contract and restocking the customer with bvs blood pumps during the term of the contract 
the exact quantity of such additional bvs blood pumps  including related cannulae  to be supplied  if any  during the term of the contract depends upon the actual usage of the product by the customer 
the terms of such contracts are typically one to three years 
in many of these extended term contracts  the fixed non refundable amount is paid at the beginning of the contract while in other contracts payment of the fixed non refundable amount is paid over the term of the contract 
we must be satisfied that the contract is supported by a valid order from the customer and is collectible before any revenue will be recognized 
we group these extended term contracts into two primary categories 
the first category is comprised of contracts that include substantial up front shipments of bvs console s and related blood pumps to customers with a commitment to provide additional blood pumps during the term of the contract if the customer uses more blood pumps than we originally supplied 
the second category is comprised of contracts that include up front shipment of blood pumps with additional blood pumps to be provided during the term of the contract if the customer uses more blood pumps than we originally supply 
in this second category the primary element of the contract is the blood pumps 
our timing of revenue recognition for the first category of contracts has historically been in accordance with sales type leases 
in this previously reported accounting  we sought to match revenues  costs and  where possible  cash flow in the same period by recognizing the full value of the contract  less deferral of the time value of money for multi year contracts  as revenue upon the shipment of the bvs console and related initial shipment of bvs pumps 
in the same period  we recorded cost of product revenue for both the cost of initial console and pump shipments and for an estimate of the cost of additional pumps that might be shipped during the term of such contract 
in our restated accounting for this first category of contracts  we prorate revenue between the value of the bvs console s and bvs pumps that are shipped initially and the value of the maximum contractual number of additional pumps that might be shipped during the contract 
if a contractual maximum number of additional pumps is not specified  we estimate the number of additional pumps that might be shipped based upon historical experience and input from the customer 
after such prorating of revenues  we recognize revenue for the initial shipment of each bvs console and pump at the time of shipment 
under this method  we defer the portion of revenue prorated to the contractual maximum or otherwise estimated number of additional pumps that might ship over the term of the contract 
this deferred revenue is then recognized ratably over the remaining term of the contract as bvs pumps are shipped 
to the extent that our deferral of revenues for this potential additional pump usage proves to be too high  any remaining deferred revenue at the end of the contract term is recognized at that time 
under this method  cost of product revenue is recorded upon shipment 
our timing of revenue recognition for the second category of contracts  our extended term renewal contracts  has since our adoption of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  for our fiscal year ended march   been ratably over the contract term 
we have historically used one of two methods for the ratable recognition of such revenues 
the first method is the recognition of such revenues on a blood pump units basis 
under this method  the total contract value was initially deferred 
this deferred value was divided by our estimate of the number of blood pumps to be shipped over the term of a contract to determine an average price per blood pump under the contract 
as each blood pump ships under the contract  the average price per blood pump under the contract was recognized as revenue up to  but not in excess of  the total order value 
costs of blood pumps were recorded upon shipment 
to the extent that our original estimate of additional pump usage proved to be too high  any remaining deferred revenue at the end of the contract term was recognized at that time 
the second method we used for ratable revenue recognition of certain of these contracts was based upon elapsed time 
under this method  a pro rata portion of the total contract value was recognized over the term of the contract based upon the relative elapsed term of the contract to the total term of the contract 
prior to the adoption of sab no 
 we recognized revenues under extended term renewal contracts in a manner that was consistent with our recognition for sales type leases 
in our restated accounting for this second category of contracts  we do not recognize any revenue based on the time elapsed method but only on a units basis 
under this units basis we calculate the average price per blood pump using the maximum number of pumps allowed under the contract  provided that if no maximum number is provided in the contract  we estimate the anticipated usage based upon historical experience and input from the customer 
we recognize revenue based upon this calculated average price per blood pump upon shipment of each pump 
to the extent that our deferral of revenues for potential additional pump usage proves to be too high because the customer uses fewer blood pumps than the contractual maximum number of additional blood pumps  or  where applicable  fewer than our estimated number of additional blood pumps  any remaining deferred revenue at the end of the contract term is recognized at that time 
the following table presents the amounts of revenue recognized under extended term contracts for each of the two categories described above during each of the three years ended march   as restated in millions year ended march  revenues by category of contract first category second category total extended term contracts percent of total extended term contract revenue from contracts using contractual maximums to calculate average price per pump estimated usage to calculate average price per pump as of march   deferred revenues from these contracts totaled million compared to million and million at march  and  respectively 
of the company s contracts with customers at march   were of the first category and were of the second category 
the terms of these contracts are all scheduled to expire during our fiscal year that ends march  accordingly all of the million in revenue that is deferred as of march  is anticipated to be recognized as revenue during fiscal we also modified our accounting for our abiocor development contract 
phase ii of that contract  which commenced in fiscal and continued into fiscal  provided an aggregate of million in funding for the company s research and development efforts related to the abiocor on a cost plus fixed fee basis 
the full amount of the contract was funded through periodic appropriation by its government sponsors 
from the early stages of phase ii of this contract  our research and development costs for this development project exceeded the contract amount 
we have received payment of the full amount of this contract 
we previously recorded revenue on this contract at the time of government appropriation provided that the company had incurred qualified costs under the contract to support our recognizing that full amount under the contract on a cost plus fixed fee basis 
in periods in which the appropriated amount exceeded the calculated revenues on a cost plus fixed fee basis  we recognized revenues based on the cost plus fixed fee calculation 
because government appropriations were made periodically  and generally only once per year  this resulted in relatively large amounts of revenues recognized in certain fiscal periods and no revenue recognized from this contract in other fiscal periods over the term of the contract 
in our restated accounting  we have recognized the appropriated amount of the contract ratably based upon elapsed time as a result revenue is recognized at a relatively consistent level of revenue recognized over the term of the contract 
our restated revenues relating to this contract are included as part of funded research and development in our consolidated statement of operations 
this modification resulting in a changes in the timing of revenue recognized on this contract but did not change the aggregate amount of revenue recognized over the term of the contract 
we also restated our accounting for costs that we previously capitalized in connection with our acquisition in september of the penn state heart and the company that was incorporated to commercialize the penn state heart  benecor heart systems  inc in our previously reported results  we capitalized the purchase cost of million of this technology and we commenced amortizing this cost on a schedule ratably over three years from the date of acquisition  with million and million of this cost amortized in fiscal and  respectively 
in our restated results  as of the date of acquisition we fully expensed the million in acquisition costs as in process research and development expense 
the result of this adjustment was to increase our previously reported research and development expenses for our fiscal year ended march  by million and to decrease the amount of research and development expenses for our fiscal year ended march  by million 
prior to this adjustment  million in net unamortized acquisition costs were classified on our consolidated balance sheet at march  as intellectual property all of which was scheduled to be amortized ratably over the eighteen month period ending september see note to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of the nature of our costs incurred and rights obtained in our acquisition of the penn state heart 
during our fiscal year ended march   the company s assistance in connection with the cashless exercises of incentive stock options for  shares of the company s common stock by two of its employees triggered a remeasurement of the value of these incentive stock options in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
in our restated results  we recorded  as additional expense for our fiscal year ended march  to reflect the value of the shares of common stock underlying these stock options upon the remeasurement date 
the net result for the employees in terms of value received was identical to the result that could have been obtained had they sold the same portion of the shares in the market at fair value on those dates 
the options had originally been granted to the employees with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting for employee stock options 
because the above described restatements reflect the timing of certain revenues and expenses and non cash transactions  our balance sheet was correspondingly adjusted in various categories  including intellectual property  accrued expenses and deferred revenues 
in addition  the company s accumulated deficit at april  was increased by million to reflect the cumulative effect of our modifications to our revenue recognition policies on prior years 
our capital resources were not impacted by any of these transactions 
these increases and decreases in operating results and associated balance sheet accounts are included in the results discussed in our md a and presented in our unaudited financial statements as filed with this annual report on form k 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenues year ended march  restated restated revenues products funded research and development 
total revenues costs and expenses cost of product revenues research and development selling  general and administrative total costs and expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net net loss fiscal years ended march  and march  fiscal and fiscal product revenues 
product revenues increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in product revenues was attributable to increased sales of bvs disposable blood pumps to existing and new customers and including international customers  increased sales of our bvs t transport backup console 
these increases reflect both increases in product shipments and the timing of previously deferred revenue under extended term contracts 
the portion of product revenues derived from sales of disposable blood pumps and related accessories and services increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the portion of product revenues derived from sales of bvs consoles increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal domestic product revenues included approximately million from extended term contracts in fiscal and million in fiscal domestic sales accounted for of total product revenue during the fiscal and of product revenue for fiscal funded research and development revenues 
contract revenues decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal approximately million of the contract revenues recognized in fiscal were derived from our abiocor government contract compared to million in the prior year as the company s funding under that contract ended in fiscal as is typical for research and development programs that have matured to the stage where they are ready to commence human clinical trials  we do not anticipate additional government research and development funding for abiocor 
included in funded research and development for the year just ended was million in revenues recorded in connection with providing specialized training to medical centers involved with our us and european abiocor clinical trials 
as of march   our total backlog of research and development contracts and grants was million 
all of these contracts and grants contain provisions that make them terminable at the convenience of the government 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues decreased to for fiscal from in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease is primarily due to the expiration of an agreement on august   in which the company paid royalties to third parties on certain bvs product revenues and to the proportionate increase in sales of bvs disposable blood pumps relatively to sales of lower margin bvs consoles 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased by million  or  to million in the fiscal  from million in the prior fiscal year 
research and development expenses were of total revenues for the fiscal and of total revenues in the prior year 
included in research and development expenses for fiscal were million in cost incurred with our acquisition of rights to the penn state heart 
excluding these acquisition costs  research and development expenses increases by million  or  in fiscal from million in fiscal research and development expenses incurred for the abiocor increased by million to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  this increase in abiocor expenditures during the fiscal year just ended is primarily attributable to our clinical trial that began in july and include costs associated with increased manufacturing  testing and documentation activities 
research and development expense for the fiscal year ended march  also included million in expenditures related to the development of the penn state heart and million in expenditures for other products under development and for enhancements for the bvs product line 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal year ended march  from million in the prior year 
expenditures increased to of total revenues from of total revenues in the same period a year earlier as a result of increased staffing  including creating of a direct sales and clinical support team in europe  and public relations activities associated with the commencement of the abiocor clinical trial 
interest and other income 
interest and other income consists primarily of interest earned on our investment balances  net of interest and other expenses 
interest and other income decreased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to reduced yields on investments resulting from lower average interest rates and to lower average fund balances available for investment 
net loss 
net loss for the fiscal year ended march  was approximately million  or per share 
this compares to a net loss of approximately million  or per share  for the prior fiscal year 
the losses for both years are primarily attributable to development and clinical testing costs associated with the abiocor and costs of acquiring and developing other technologies and products 
fiscal years ended march  and march  fiscal and fiscal product revenues 
product revenues increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in product revenues was primarily attributable to increased sales of bvs disposable blood pumps to new and existing customers  higher average selling prices for these blood pumps and sales of our new bvs t transport backup console 
the increased sales of bvs disposable blood pumps reflects both increases in product shipments and the timing of previously deferred revenue under extended term contracts 
the portion of product revenues derived from sales of disposable blood pumps and related accessories and services increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the portion of product revenues derived from sales of bvs consoles increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal domestic product revenues included approximately million from extended term contracts in fiscal and million in fiscal domestic sales accounted for of total product revenue during the fiscal year ended march  and funded research and development revenues 
contract revenues decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal approximately million of the contract revenues recognized in both periods were derived from our abiocor government contract 
the decline in funded research and development revenues is primarily due to the completion or winding down of research and development work performed under certain government sponsored research contracts and grants 
as is typical for research and development programs that have matured to the stage where they are ready to commence human clinical trials  we do not anticipate additional government research and development funding for abiocor and  as a result  we anticipate that our funded research and development revenues will decline in our new fiscal year 
as of march   our total backlog of research and development contracts and grants was million  including million in revenues not recognized on the abiocor contract 
all of these contracts and grants contain provisions that make them terminable at the convenience of the government 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues increased to for the fiscal year ended march  from in the prior fiscal year 
the increase was primarily due to production inefficiencies associated with the production startup of our new bvs t transport backup console and transitional costs related to our moving and qualifying our new bvs blood pump manufacturing facility 
these increases to our cost of product revenues were partly offset by the discontinuation of a royalty obligation due to the abiomed limited partnership 
the royalty obligation  which on a net basis was approximately of the majority of bvs product revenues  contractually expired for product sold after august  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  to million in the fiscal  from million in the prior fiscal year 
research and development expenses were of total revenues for the fiscal and of total revenues in the prior year 
included in research and development expenses for fiscal were million in cost incurred in connection with our acquisition of rights to the penn state heart 
excluding these acquisition costs  research and development expenses in fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
excluding penn state heart acquisition costs  the increase in expenditures during the fiscal year ended march  was due primarily to increased spending for the abiocor  including preparations for initial clinical trials and increased cost for further development of the penn state heart and development of other new products and enhancements for the bvs product line 
research and development expenses during the fiscal year ended march  included million of expenses incurred in connection with our development activities for the abiocor  compared to million in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in the prior year 
these expenditures were approximately of total revenues in fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal reduced legal expenses in fiscal compared with fiscal were partially offset by increased costs associated with increased sales and administrative staffing and related activities 
interest and other income 
interest and other income consists primarily of interest earned on our investment balances  net of interest and other expenses 
interest and other income increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to higher average funds available for investment as a result of the company s stock offering in march net loss 
net loss for the fiscal year ended march  was approximately million  or per share 
this compares to a net loss of approximately million  or per share  for the prior fiscal year 
the losses for both years are primarily attributable to development and pre clinical testing costs associated with the abiocor 
liquidity and capital resources we have supported our operations primarily with net revenues from sales of our bvs product line  government contracts and proceeds from our equity financings 
as of march   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million 
during fiscal  operating activities used million of cash 
net cash used by operating activities in fiscal reflected a net loss of million  including non cash depreciation and amortization expense of million and stock based compensation of million  and increases in inventory and prepaid expenses and other current assets of million and million  respectively 
cash was also used to reduce accounts payable  deferred revenues and long term liabilities by million  million and million  respectively 
these uses of cash were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in accrued expenses of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in accounts receivable is attributable to collection of million due from the abiocor government contract and more extensive efforts to reduce bvs trade receivables during the fiscal year ended march  the increase in inventory is the result of the company s effort to maintain greater stocks of bvs disposable blood pump materials and finished goods in connection with planned shipments 
during fiscal  investing activities used million of cash 
approximately million in cash was used for the acquisition of short term marketable securities  net of sales of similar securities 
we also expended cash for capital equipment and leasehold improvements of million 
financing activities generated million of cash during fiscal cash used to pay off equipment loans of million was offset by million of cash received as a result of stock options exercised during the fiscal year and the purchase of shares by employees under the employee stock purchase plan 
income taxes incurred during fiscal were not material  and we continue to have significant net tax operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the following table in thousands summarizes the company s contractual obligations at march  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations     total contractual cash obligations      at the company s election the lease for its primary operating facility may be terminated in the lump sum buyout cost for early termination is million 
we believe that our revenue from product sales and government contracts  together with existing resources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations  including the planned expenditures for our internally funded abiocor  penn state heart and new bvs development and product extension efforts  for the next twelve months 
however  we may require significant additional funds in order to complete the development  conduct clinical trials  and achieve regulatory approvals of the abiocor  penn state heart and other products under development over the next several years 
we may also need additional funds for possible future strategic acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies complementary to our business 
if additional funds are required  we may raise such funds from time to time through public or private sales of equity or from borrowings 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  warranty obligations  inventory valuations  intellectual property and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenues from two principal sources product sales  including maintenance service agreements  and funded research and development contracts and grants from government and other third party sources 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  including sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
the majority of our product revenues are derived from our shipment of products to fulfill customer orders for a specified number of bvs consoles and blood pumps for a specified price 
we recognize revenues and record costs related to such sales upon product shipment 
see item management s discussions and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  restatement of prior year s financial statements 
other of our product revenues are derived from extended term contracts with certain of our customers 
these contracts  which typically have terms of one to three years  provide for the company to receive a fixed  non refundable amount of money over a set period of time in return for our providing these customers with bvs product at the start of the contract and restocking the customer with bvs blood pumps during the term of the contract 
the exact quantity of such additional pumps to be supplied  if any  depends upon the actual usage of the product by the customer to support their patients 
under these contracts  we recognize revenue  and record related cost of product revenues  ratably over the term of the contract using an estimated per unit selling price based upon actual shipments of pumps to customers compared to the maximum number of additional pumps allowable under the contract  or when a maximum number is not specified  compared to our estimate of additional pumps that might be required by the customer 
in the majority of contracts that contain contractual limits on the number of pumps  customers do not use the maximum number of allowable pumps resulting in our recognition of the remaining deferred revenue at the end of the contract term  with no associated incremental cost 
when we do not have a contractual maximum number of pumps upon which to rely  we estimate customer blood pump usage and resulting per unit selling price based upon historical experience and based on information from our customers 
we update these estimates over the term of a contract based upon significant and quantifiable changes in customer information and adjust the per unit selling price  as appropriate 
our estimates of customer blood pump usage and resulting per unit selling price that we use to determine the timing of revenue recognition involve risks 
for example  when our estimate of customer usage proves to be higher than our customer s actual usage during the term of a contract  we recognize as revenue the remaining deferred balance of the contract at the end of the contract term resulting in revenue recognition in that period despite no or minimal blood pump usage by our customer during that period 
while such changes in estimated per unit selling prices based on changes in estimated customer usage have historically not had a material effect on the aggregate amounts of revenue recognition  no guarantee can be made that the company will experience the same level of accuracy in estimateing future customer usage 
cash received in advance of revenue in connection with the sale of blood pumps under extended term contracts is recorded as deferred revenue and is classified as a current or long term liability depending on the expected shipment dates of the blood pumps 
maintenance service revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the service contracts based upon the elapsed term of the service contract 
government sponsored research and development contracts and grants generally provide for payment on a cost plus fixed fee basis 
revenues from these contracts and grants are recognized as work is performed  provided the government has appropriated sufficient funds for the work 
under contracts in which the company elects to spend significantly more on the development project during the term of the contract than the total contract amount  the company prospectively recognizes revenue on such contracts ratably over the term of the contract as it incurs related research and development costs  provided the government has appropriated sufficient funds for the work 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
warranties 
our bvs product line is subject to rigorous regulation and quality standards 
while our company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and product recalls 
our operating results could be adversely effected if the actual cost of product failures  including product recalls  exceeds our estimated warranty provision 
inventories 
we value our inventory of products held for sale at the lower of cost or current estimated market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required adversely impacting our financial results for the period in which the additional excess or obsolete inventory is identified 
all of our inventories related to our bvs product line 
we do not currently capitalize any costs related to abiocor inventory as such product is part of a clinical trial and not available for sale 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  as of march   the company had federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million which begin to expire in and  respectively 
the company also has federal and state research and experimentation credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  which begin to expire in we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as an offset against these otherwise recognizable net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the realization of the tax benefit 
in the event that we determine in the future that the company will be able to realize all or a portion of its net deferred tax benefit  an adjustment to deferred tax valuation allowance would increase net income in the period such a determination was made 
risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
current and prospective investors should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties described in this section and all of the other information in this report 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be severely harmed by any of the following risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline if any of these risks and uncertainties develop into actual events 
our future success is strongly dependent on development of the abiocor 
our development efforts may not be successful 
we are currently devoting our principal research and development and regulatory efforts  and significant financial resources  to the development of the abiocor and of the penn state heart 
implantable replacement heart systems  like the abiocor and the penn state heart are complex medical devices and have never been successfully developed or marketed by any company 
the development of implantable replacement heart devices such as the abiocor and penn state heart  and other new products  presents enormous challenges in a variety of areas  many or all of which we may have difficulty in overcoming  including blood compatible surfaces  blood compatible flow  manufacturing techniques  pumping mechanisms  physiological control  energy transfer  anatomical fit and surgical techniques 
for many years  we and other parties have been attempting to develop a heart replacement device  but to date  none of these efforts has been proven successful 
we cannot be sure that we will be successful in our development efforts  and in the event that we are unable to commercialize the abiocor  our business and financial condition would be adversely affected 
the markets for the abiocor and our other products under development are unproven 
even if the abiocor or any other of our products are successfully developed and approved by the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities  they may not enjoy commercial acceptance or success  which would adversely affect our business and results of operations 
several factors could limit our success  including our need to create a market for an implantable replacement heart  and possible limited market acceptance among physicians  medical centers  patients and third party payers  the need for surgeons to develop or be trained in new surgical techniques to use our product effectively  limitations on the number of patients who may have access to physicians and medical centers with adequate training  equipment and personnel to make use of our products  limitations inherent in first generation devices  and the potential failure to develop successive improvements  including increases in service life  which would reduce the addressable market for the abiocor  the lifestyle limitations that patients will have to accept  including traveling with external batteries at all times and potentially avoiding activities such as air travel or diving that involve significant pressure changes  the timing and amount of reimbursement for these products  if any  by third party payers  the introduction by other companies of new treatments  products and technologies which compete with our products  and may reduce their market acceptance  or make them obsolete  the reluctance  due to ethical considerations  of physicians  patients and society as a whole to accept medical devices that replace the heart  and the reluctance of physicians  patients and society as a whole to accept the finite life and risk of mechanical failure of devices that replace the heart 
the commercial success of the abiocor and other heart assist products will require acceptance by cardiovascular surgeons and interventional and heart failure cardiologists  a limited number of whom significantly influence medical device selection and purchasing decisions 
we may achieve our business objectives only if the abiocor and our other products are accepted and recommended by leading physicians  which is likely to be based on a determination by these physicians that our products are safe  cost effective and represent acceptable methods of treatment 
although we have developed relationships with leading cardiac surgeons and cardiologists  we cannot assure that these existing relationships and arrangements can be maintained or that new relationships will be established in support of the abiocor and our other products 
if cardiovascular surgeons and cardiologists do not consider our products to be adequate for the treatment of our target cardiac patient population or if a sufficient number of physicians recommend and use competing products  it would seriously harm our business 
testing of our new products will involve uncertainties and risks which could delay or prevent new product introductions  require us to incur substantial additional costs or result in our failure to bring our products to market 
if we cannot demonstrate through clinical testing on humans that the abiocor or other new products are safe and effective  we will not be able to obtain regulatory approvals in the us or other countries for the commercial sale of these products 
our clinical testing of the abiocor is in its early stages 
delays  budget overruns  and project terminations are not uncommon even after promising pre clinical and clinical trials of medical products 
we intend to conduct clinical testing for the abiocor and other heart assist and heart replacement products with critically ill patients  and these patients may die or suffer other adverse medical results for reasons which may or may not be related to the product being tested 
those outcomes could seriously delay the completion of clinical testing  as could the unavailability of suitable patients for clinical trials  both of which are outside our control 
we cannot assure that the rate of patient enrollment in our clinical trials will be consistent with our expectations or be sufficient to allow us to complete our clinical trials for the abiocor or our other products under development in a timely manner  if at all 
delays could defer the marketing and commercial sale of our products  require further funding  and possibly result in failure to bring the products to market 
development and testing of design changes to the abiocor and other products under development is often extensive  expensive and time consuming 
some of the tests for our products may require months or years to perform  and we could be required to begin these tests again if we modify one of our products to correct a problem identified in testing 
even modest changes to certain components of our products can take months or years to complete and test 
if results of pre clinical or clinical testing of the abiocor or other products under development indicate that design changes are required  such changes could cause serious delays that would adversely affect our results of operations 
a number of companies in the medical industry have suffered delays  cost overruns and project terminations despite achieving promising results in pre clinical testing or early clinical testing 
in the event that we suffer setbacks in the pre clinical or clinical testing of the abiocor or other heart assist products  these products may be delayed  require further funding  and possibly may not be brought to market 
if we fail to obtain approval from the fda and from foreign regulatory authorities  we cannot market and sell the abiocor or other new heart assist products in the us and in other countries 
obtaining required regulatory approvals may take several years to complete and consume substantial capital resources 
we cannot assure that the fda or any other regulatory authority will act quickly or favorably on our requests for product approval  or that the fda or any other regulatory authority will not require us to provide additional data that we do not currently anticipate in order to obtain product approvals 
we cannot apply for fda approval to market the abiocor and our other products under development until the product successfully completes its clinical trials 
several factors could prevent successful completion or cause significant delays of these trials  including an inability to enroll the required number of patients or failure to demonstrate adequately that the product is safe and effective for use in humans 
if safety problems develop  the fda could stop our trials before completion 
in addition  we are planning to conduct phased clinical trials for the abiocor tailored to specific patient populations with different life expectancies 
if we are successful in obtaining fda approvals for the abiocor based on this phased approach  the initial approvals are likely to include conditions or limitations to particular indications that would limit the available market for these products 
if we are not able to obtain regulatory approvals for use of the abiocor or our other products under development  or if the patient populations for which they are approved are not sufficiently broad  the commercial success of these products could be limited 
we intend to market the abiocor and our other new products in international markets  including the european union and japan 
we must obtain separate regulatory approvals in order to market our products in other jurisdictions 
the approval process may differ among those jurisdictions and approval in the us or in any other jurisdiction does not ensure approval in other jurisdictions 
obtaining foreign approvals could result in significant delays  difficulties and costs for us  and require additional trials and additional expense 
if we obtain regulatory approval of our new products  the products will be subject to continuing review and extensive regulatory requirements  which could affect the manufacturing and marketing of our products 
the fda continues to review products even after they have received initial approval 
if and when the fda approves the abiocor or our other products under development  the manufacture and marketing of these products will be subject to continuing regulation  including compliance with current quality systems regulations and good manufacturing practices  known as qsr gmp  adverse event reporting requirements and prohibitions on promoting a product for unapproved uses 
we will also be required to obtain additional approvals in the event we significantly modify the design of an approved product or the product s labeling or manufacturing process 
modifications of this type are common with new products  and we anticipate that the current first generation of the abiocor will undergo a number of changes  refinements and improvements over time 
for example  the current configuration of the abiocor s thoracic unit  or replacement heart  is sized for patients with relatively large chest cavities  and we anticipate that we will need to obtain regulatory approval of thoracic units of other sizes 
if we are not able to obtain regulatory approval of modifications to our current and future products  the commercial success of these products would be limited 
we and our third party suppliers of product components are also subject to inspection and market surveillance by the fda for qsr gmp and other requirements 
enforcement actions resulting from failure to comply with government requirements could result in fines  suspensions of approvals  recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions  and affect the manufacture and marketing of our products 
the fda could withdraw a previously approved product from the market upon receipt of newly discovered information  including a failure to comply with regulatory requirements  the occurrence of unanticipated problems with products following approval  or other reasons  which could adversely affect our operating results 
the cost of developing and manufacturing the abiocor and our other planned new products is substantial for a company of our size and will exert a strain on our available resources 
in recent years we have significantly increased our research and development expenditures for the abiocor  and we expect that this trend will continue in the future 
we will also need to make significant expenditures to begin to manufacture and market the abiocor and our other planned new products in commercial quantities for sale in the us and other countries  if and when we obtain regulatory approval to do so 
we cannot be sure that our estimates of capital expenditures for the abiocor and the development of our other new products will be accurate 
we could have significant cost overruns  which could reduce our ability to commercialize our products 
any delay or inability to commercialize our products under development could adversely affect our business prospects and results of operations 
we do not operate at a profit and do not expect to be profitable for some time 
we had a net loss of million in fiscal and a net loss of million in fiscal we are committed to making large expenditures for the abiocor and  to a lesser extent  other new products  in fiscal and subsequent fiscal years  which may result in losses in future periods 
these expenditures include costs associated with performing clinical trials for the abiocor  continuing our research and development relating to the abiocor and other new products  seeking regulatory approvals for the abiocor and  if we receive these approvals  commencing commercial manufacturing and marketing of the abiocor 
the amount of these expenditures is difficult to forecast accurately  and cost overruns may occur 
we plan to fund a portion of these expenditures from our limited existing financial resources and revenues from bvs sales  which are variable and uncertain 
we cannot be sure that we will have the necessary funds to develop and commercialize our new products  or that additional funds will be available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event that we are unable to obtain the necessary funding to develop and commercialize our products  our business may be adversely affected 
we do not have audited financial statements  which may create uncertainty for investors in our common stock 
we currently do not have audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended march   march  and march   as restated 
audits of these periods by our recently engaged independent accountants could result in discoveries of facts or circumstances of which we are not aware that require modification in our financial statements 
there can be no assurances that there will not be changes in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k when the audits have been completed 
in addition  our lack of audited financial statements may cause the market price of our common stock to decline because investors may be unwilling to invest in our company while audited financial information is unavailable 
our operating results may fluctuate unpredictably 
our annual and quarterly operating results have fluctuated historically and we expect these fluctuations to continue 
among the factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate are costs we incur in developing and testing the abiocor and other new products or product enhancements  the timing of regulatory actions  such as product approvals or recalls  costs we incur in anticipation of future sales  such as inventory purchases  expansion of manufacturing facilities  or establishment of international sales offices  the timing of customer orders and deliveries for bvs blood pumps and consoles to current and new customers  competitive changes  such as price changes or new product introductions that we or our competitors may make  economic conditions in the health care industry and the state of cost containment efforts  including reimbursement policies 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical and future results will not necessarily be meaningful  and that investors should not rely on them as an indication of future performance 
to the extent we experience the factors described above  our future operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors from time to time  which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
the bvs product line  our principal product and current primary source of revenues  is vulnerable to competitive pressures  disruptions in sales  continuing review and extensive regulatory requirements 
all of our product revenues to date have come from sales of the bvs line of products 
we believe that we will continue to be dependent on our bvs product line for at least the next several years  unless and until we are able to successfully develop or acquire  obtain regulatory approval for  and sell new products 
in the event that a competitor were to introduce new treatments  products and technologies which compete with our products  add new features to their existing products or reduce their prices to make their products more financially attractive to customers  our revenue from our bvs products could decline 
for example  in the event of the expansion of technologies  which allow heart surgical procedures to be performed without stopping the heart  a reduction in the market for the bvs could potentially result 
further  the bvs is subject to stringent and continuing fda and other regulatory requirements  including compliance with qsr gmp  adverse event reporting  prohibitions on promoting the bvs for unapproved uses  and continued inspection and market surveillance by the fda 
if bvs products are recalled or otherwise withdrawn from the market  our revenues would likely decline  which would hurt our business 
in addition  variations in the quantity and timing of sales of bvs consoles have a disproportionate effect on our revenues  because the price of the console is substantially greater than the price of our disposable blood pumps 
if we cannot maintain and increase our revenues from our bvs product line  our overall business and financial condition could be adversely affected 
revenues from our bvs product line in fiscal increased by from revenues in fiscal  and in fiscal our bvs revenues increased by from revenues in fiscal to maintain or increase revenues from sales of our bvs products  we may be required to adopt new sales and marketing strategies  some of which may require expending additional capital resources 
the new strategies we may adopt include promoting increased use of the bvs by existing customers in order to increase disposable blood pump sales to those customers  selling the bvs to smaller hospitals and medical centers in the us  regularly introducing enhancements to the bvs  expanding sales of our bvs product line in international markets  some of which require separate regulatory approvals  and seeking new categories of patients to support with the device 
in the event that we are unsuccessful in carrying out these new strategies  our revenues may decline 
we may not be successful in expanding our sales activities into international markets 
we are seeking to expand our international sales of the bvs and prepare for commercialization of the abiocor by recruiting direct sales and support teams for selected countries in europe and pursuing regulatory approval of the bvs in japan 
to date we have limited experience in selling the bvs internationally 
in fiscal  approximately  and in fiscal  approximately  of our revenues from the bvs product line were derived from international sales 
our international operations will be subject to a number of risks  which may vary from the risks we experience in the us  including the need to obtain regulatory approvals in foreign countries before our products may be sold or used  longer sales cycles  dependence on local distributors  limited protection of intellectual property rights  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  fluctuations in the values of foreign currencies  and political and economic instability 
if we are unable to effectively expand our sales activities in international markets  our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
we depend on third party reimbursement to our customers for market acceptance of our products 
if third party payers fail to provide appropriate levels of reimbursement for purchase and use of our products  our profitability would be adversely affected 
sales of medical products largely depend on the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government health care programs and private health insurers 
the cost of our bvs system is substantial  and we anticipate that the cost of implanting the abiocor in a patient will also be substantial 
without the financial support of the government or third party insurers  the market for our products will be limited 
medical products and devices incorporating new technologies are closely examined by governments and private insurers to determine whether the products and devices will be covered by reimbursement  and if so  the level of reimbursement which may apply 
we cannot be sure that third party payers will reimburse sales of our products now under development  or enable us to sell them at profitable prices 
we also cannot be sure that third party payers will continue the current level of reimbursement to physicians and medical centers for use of the bvs 
any reduction in the amount of this reimbursement could harm our business 
the federal government and private insurers have considered ways to change  and have changed  the manner in which health care services are provided and paid for in the us in the future  it is possible that the government may institute price controls and further limits on medicare and medicaid spending 
these controls and limits could affect the payments we collect from sales of our products 
internationally  medical reimbursement systems vary significantly  with some medical centers having fixed budgets  regardless of levels of patient treatment  and other countries requiring application for  and approval of  government or third party reimbursement 
even if we succeed in bringing our new products to market  uncertainties regarding future health care policy  legislation and regulation  as well as private market practices  could affect our ability to sell our products in commercially acceptable quantities at profitable prices 
prior to approving coverage for new medical devices  most third party payers require evidence that the product has received fda approval  is not experimental  and is medically necessary for the specific patient 
increasingly  third party payers require evidence that the devices being used are cost effective 
the abiocor and our other products under development may not meet these or future criteria  which could hurt our ability to market and sell these products 
if we fail to achieve and maintain the high manufacturing standards that our products require or if we are unable to develop additional manufacturing capacity  we will not be successful 
our products require precise  high quality manufacturing 
our failure to achieve and maintain these high manufacturing standards  including the incidence of manufacturing errors  design defects or component failures  could result in patient injury or death  product recalls or withdrawals  delays or failures in product testing or delivery  cost overruns or other problems that could seriously hurt our business 
we have from time to time voluntarily recalled certain products 
despite our very high manufacturing standards  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of errors  defects or failures 
if we are not able to manufacture the bvs in accordance with necessary quality standards  our business and results of operations may be negatively affected 
the abiocor involves even greater manufacturing complexities than the bvs 
the abiocor must be significantly more durable and meet different standards  which may be more difficult to achieve  than those that apply to our current bvs product line 
if we are unable to manufacture the abiocor or other future products on a timely basis at acceptable quality and cost and in commercial quantities  or if we experience unanticipated technological problems or delays in production  our business will suffer 
the manufacture of our products is and will continue to be complex and costly  requiring a number of separate processes and components 
achieving precision and quality control requires skill and diligence by our personnel 
further  to be successful  we believe we will need to increase our manufacturing capacity 
we may experience difficulties in scaling up manufacturing of our new products  including problems related to product yields  quality control and assurance  component and service availability  adequacy of control policies and procedures  and lack of skilled personnel 
if we cannot hire  train and retain enough experienced and capable scientific and technical workers  we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our current or future products at an acceptable cost and on time  which could limit market acceptance of our products or otherwise damage our business 
if our suppliers cannot provide the components we require  our ability to manufacture our products could be harmed 
we rely on third party suppliers to provide us with certain components used in the abiocor  penn state heart  bvs and our other products under development 
relying on third party suppliers makes us vulnerable to component part failures and to interruptions in supply  either of which could impair our ability to conduct clinical tests or to ship our products to our customers on a timely basis 
using third party vendors makes it difficult and sometimes impossible for us to test fully certain components  such as components on circuit boards  maintain quality control  manage inventory and production schedules and control production costs 
vendor lead times to supply us with ordered components vary significantly and can exceed six months or more 
both now and as we expand our manufacturing capacity  we cannot be sure that our suppliers will furnish us with required components when we need them 
these factors could make it more difficult for us to effectively and efficiently manufacture our products  and could adversely impact our results of operations 
some suppliers may be the only source for a particular component  which makes us vulnerable to cost increases and supply interruptions 
vendors may decide to limit or eliminate sales of certain products to the medical industry due to product liability or other concerns  and we might not be able to find a suitable replacement for those products 
manufacturers of our product components may be required to comply with fda or other regulatory manufacturing regulations and to satisfy regulatory inspections in connection with the manufacture of the components 
if we cannot obtain a necessary component  we may need to find  test and obtain regulatory approval for a replacement component  produce the component ourselves or redesign the related product  which would cause significant delay and could increase our manufacturing costs 
any of these events could adversely impact our results of operations 
intense competition could harm our financial performance 
intense competition  rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards in the heart assist markets could decrease demand for our products or make them obsolete 
some of the companies  universities and research organizations developing competing products have greater resources and experience than we have 
our competitors could commence and complete clinical testing of their products  obtain regulatory approvals and begin commercial scale manufacturing of their products faster than we are able to for our products 
they could develop superior products or products of similar quality at the same or lower prices 
in addition  our customers often have limited budgets 
consequently  our products compete against a broad range of medical devices and therapies for these limited funds 
if we do not use reasonable efforts to further develop the penn state heart  certain rights to that technology could revert back to the pennsylvania state university and be used to compete against us 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete effectively and successfully in the markets in which we participate 
we own patents  trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights and other intellectual property and know how that we believe gives us a competitive advantage 
if we cannot protect our intellectual property  competition could force us to lower our prices  which could hurt our profitability 
our intellectual property rights are and will continue to be a critical component of our success 
a substantial portion of our intellectual property rights relating to the abiocor  bvs  penn state heart and other products under development is in the form of trade secrets  rather than patents 
in order to preserve certain proprietary information as trade secrets  we are required to restrict disclosure of information intended to constitute trade secrets to third parties 
we protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge in part through confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
certain of our consultants and third parties with whom we have business relationships may also provide services to other parties in the medical device industry  including companies  universities and research organizations that are developing competing products 
in addition  some of our former employees may seek employment with  and become employed by  our competitors 
we cannot assure that confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and third parties will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach  or that our trade secrets will not become known to or be independently developed by our competitors 
the loss of trade secret protection for technologies or know how relating to the abiocor  bvs or penn state heart could adversely affect our business prospects 
our business position will also depend in part on our ability to defend our existing and future patents and rights and conduct our business activities free of infringement claims by third parties 
we intend to seek additional patents  but our pending and future patent applications may not be approved  may not give us a competitive advantage  and could be challenged by others 
patent proceedings in the us and in other countries may be expensive and time consuming 
in addition  patents issued by foreign countries may afford less protection than is available under us patent law  and may not adequately protect our proprietary information 
our competitors may independently develop proprietary technologies and processes that are the same as or substantially equivalent to ours  or design around our patents 
companies in the medical device industry typically obtain patents and frequently engage in substantial intellectual property litigation 
our products and technologies could infringe on the rights of others 
if a third party successfully asserts a claim for infringement against us  we may be liable for substantial damages  be unable to sell products using that technology  or have to seek a license or redesign the related product 
these alternatives may be uneconomical or impossible 
patent litigation could be costly  result in product development delays  and divert the efforts and attention of management from our business 
if we cannot attract and retain the management  sales and other personnel we need  we will not be successful 
we depend heavily on the contributions of the principal members of our technical  sales and support  regulatory and clinical  operating and administrative management and staff  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
competition for skilled and experienced management  scientific personnel and sales personnel in the medical devices industry is intense 
if we lose the services of any of the principal members of our management and staff  or if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future  especially scientific and sales personnel  our business could be adversely affected 
we expect to grow rapidly if the abiocor and our other products under development advance through the approval process 
the expansion of personnel and facilities will strain our management and our financial and other resources 
if we cannot manage this growth successfully  our business will likely suffer 
product liability claims could damage our reputation and hurt our financial results 
the clinical use of medical products  even after regulatory approval  poses an inherent risk of product liability claims 
we maintain limited product liability insurance coverage  subject to deductibles and exclusions 
we cannot be sure that product liability insurance will be available in the future or will be available on acceptable terms or at reasonable costs  or that such insurance will provide us with adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
claims against us  regardless of their merit or potential outcome  may also hurt our ability to obtain physician endorsement of our products or expand our business 
many patients using the bvs do not survive 
there are many factors beyond our control that could result in patient death  including the condition of the patient prior to use of the product  the skill and reliability of physicians and hospital personnel using and monitoring the product  and product maintenance by customers 
however  the failure of the bvs or other life support products we distribute for clinical test or sale could give rise to product liability claims and negative publicity 
the risk of product liability claims could increase as we introduce new products like the abiocor that are intended to support a patient until the end of life 
the abiocor will have a finite life and could cause unintended complications to other organs and may not be able to successfully support all patients 
its malfunction could give rise to product liability claims whether or not it has extended or improved the quality of the patient s life 
we cannot be sure that we can obtain liability insurance to cover the bvs  the abiocor or other new products at a reasonable cost  if at all 
if we have to pay product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage  our financial condition will be adversely affected 
our rights distribution  certificate of incorporation and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us and may prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium on our stock 
our rights distribution and provisions of our certificate of incorporation and of the delaware general corporation law may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would allow our stockholders to receive a premium over the prevailing market price of our stock 
our rights distribution and those provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law are intended to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with us and allow our board of directors the opportunity to consider alternative proposals in the interest of maximizing stockholder value 
however  such provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control  which could negatively affect our stock price 
the market value of our common stock could vary significantly  based on market perceptions of the status of our development efforts 
the perception of securities analysts regarding our product development efforts could significantly affect our stock price 
as a result  the market price of our common stock could change substantially when we or our competitors make product announcements  particularly announcements relating to the abiocor or competing products 
many factors affecting our stock price are industry related and beyond our control 
if we make acquisitions  we could encounter difficulties that harm our business 
we may acquire companies  products or technologies that we believe to be complementary to our business 
if we do so  we may have difficulty integrating the acquired personnel  operations  products or technologies 
these difficulties may disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses  which could hurt our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
however  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of federal agency obligations  state and municipal bonds  and us treasury notes with maturities of one year or less 
these held to maturity securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at march  the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio
