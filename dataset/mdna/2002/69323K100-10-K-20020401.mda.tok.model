liquidity and capital resources the company s primary capital need has been funding the working capital requirements created by its growth in sales 
historically  the company s primary sources of financing have come from cash flow from operations  public offerings and borrowings from its stockholders  private investors and financial institutions

cash flows from operations were million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
inventory increased million in and inventory turns declined to from in inventory increased at the end of versus as a result of strategic purchases made at the end of accounts receivable decreased million to million during  primarily due to strong cash collections and improved days sales outstanding 
for the year ended december   the company s capital expenditures were million compared to million in and million in the company s primary capital needs will continue to fund its working capital requirements for anticipated sales growth  possible acquisitions and new business ventures 
in march  the company replaced its existing million credit facility with a new million  three year asset based revolving credit facility from a lending unit of a large commercial bank the new line of credit 
the new line of credit functions as a working capital line of credit with a borrowing base of inventory and accounts receivable  and bears interest at prime with a libor option 
at december   the prime rate was 
the new line of credit is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
the new line of credit has as its single financial covenant a minimum tangible net worth requirement and also includes a commitment fee of annually on the unused portion of the line up to million 
in addition  in march  the company entered into a new million flooring credit facility  which functions in lieu of a vendor trade payable for inventory purchases and does not bear interest if paid within terms specific to each vendor the new flooring facility 
the new flooring facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets and is also supported by a letter of credit issued under the new line of credit in the amount outstanding under the new flooring facility from time to time 
the amount of the letter of credit is applied against the credit limit under the new line of credit 
the company had million of borrowings under the credit facility included in accounts payable and million of net working capital advances outstanding at december  at december  and  the company had cash and short term investments of million and million  respectively  and working capital of million and million  respectively 
the company has historically funded its operations through a combination of operating cash flow  current working capital and available lines of credit 
the company believes that current working capital  together with cash flows from operations and available lines of credit  will be adequate to support the company s current operating plans through however  if the company needs extra funds  such as for acquisitions or expansion or to fund a significant downturn in sales that causes losses  there are no assurances that adequate financing will be available at acceptable terms  if at all 
in july  the company announced its plan to repurchase up to  shares of its common stock 
the shares will be repurchased from time to time at prevailing market prices  through open market or negotiated transactions  depending upon market conditions 
no limit was placed on the duration of the repurchase program 
there is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that the company will repurchase 
subject to applicable securities laws  repurchases may be made at such times and in such amounts as the company s management deems appropriate 
the program can also be discontinued at any time management feels additional purchases are not warranted 
as of december   the company has repurchased  shares 
as part of its growth strategy  the company may  in the future  acquire other companies in the same or complementary lines of business  and pursue other business ventures 
any launch of a new business venture or any acquisition and the ensuing integration of the operations of the acquired company with those of the company would place additional demands on the company s management  operating and financial resources

 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas  which changes the accounting for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets from an amortization method to an impairment only approach  will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company has not determined the full impact that adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements 
however  the company does anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses will be reduced by approximately million per year due to the discontinuance of goodwill amortization as required by the standard 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supercedes fas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of and apb opinion no

 consolidated financial statements 
this statement was issued to address the accounting for a segment of a business accounted for as a discontinued operation under apb no 
and to establish a single accounting model based on the framework established in fas no 
 for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
the statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
