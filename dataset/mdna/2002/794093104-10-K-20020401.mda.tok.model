item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
our condensed consolidated financial statements are not directly comparable from period to period because of our acquisition and disposition of radio stations and our acquisition of other media businesses 
see note to our condensed consolidated financial statements 
historically  our principal sources of revenue have been the sale of block program time  both to national and local program producers  the sale of advertising time on our radio stations  both to national and local advertisers  and the sale of advertising time on our national radio network 
in  we expanded our sources of revenue and product offerings with the acquisition of other media businesses  including publishing and internet businesses 
the following table shows gross broadcasting revenue  the percentage of gross broadcasting revenue for each broadcasting revenue source and net broadcasting revenue 
year ended december  dollars in thousands block program time national local advertising national local infomercials salem radio network other gross broadcasting revenue less agency commissions net broadcasting revenue our broadcasting revenue is affected primarily by the program rates our radio stations charge and by the advertising rates our radio stations and network charge 
the rates for block program time are based upon our stations ability to attract audiences that will support the program producers through contributions and purchases of their products 
advertising rates are based upon the demand for advertising time  which in turn is based on our stations and network s ability to produce results for its advertisers 
historically we have not subscribed to traditional audience measuring services 
instead  we have marketed ourselves to advertisers based upon the responsiveness of our audience 
in selected markets we subscribe to arbitron  which develops quarterly reports to measure a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers 
see business radio stations 
each of our radio stations and our network have a general pre determined level of time that they make available for block programs and or advertising  which may vary at different times of the day 
in recent years  we have begun to place greater emphasis on the development of local advertising in all of our markets 
we encourage our general managers and sales managers to increase advertising revenue 
we can create additional advertising revenue in a variety of ways  such as removing block programming that generates marginal audience response  adjusting the start time of programs to add advertising in more desirable time slots and increasing advertising rates 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue generally exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue 
quarterly revenue from the sale of block program time does not tend to vary  however  since program rates are generally set annually 
our cash flow is affected by a transition period experienced by radio stations when  due to the nature of the radio station  our plans for the market and other circumstances  we find it beneficial or advisable to change its format 
this transition period is when we develop a radio station s customer and listener base 
during this period  a station will typically generate negative or insignificant cash flow 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations often utilize trade or barter agreements to exchange advertising time for goods or services such as other media advertising  travel or lodging  in lieu of cash 
in order to preserve the sale of our advertising time for cash  we generally enter into trade agreements only if the goods or services bartered to us will be used in our business 
we have minimized our use of trade agreements and have generally sold most of our advertising time for cash 
in  we sold of our advertising time for cash 
in addition  it is our general policy not to preempt advertising paid for in cash with advertising paid for in trade 
the primary operating expenses incurred in the ownership and operation of our radio stations include employee salaries and commissions  and facility expenses for example  rent and utilities 
beginning in  in connection with the launch of our contemporary christian music format in several markets  we incurred increased amounts for promotional expenses and music license fees 
in addition to these expenses  our network incurs programming costs and lease expenses for satellite communication facilities 
we also incur and will continue to incur significant depreciation  amortization and interest expense as a result of completed and future acquisitions of radio stations and existing and future borrowings 
oneplace  our internet business  earns its revenue from the i sales of streaming services  ii sales of banner advertising and sponsorships on the internet  and  iii to a lesser extent  sales of software and software support contracts 
ccm  our publishing business  earns its revenue by selling advertising in and subscriptions to its publications 
the revenue and related operating expenses of these businesses are reported as other media on our condensed consolidated statements of operations 
the performance of a radio broadcasting company is customarily measured by the ability of its stations to generate broadcast cash flow and ebitda 
we define broadcast cash flow as net operating income  excluding other media revenue and other media operating expenses  before depreciation and amortization and corporate expenses 
we define ebitda as net operating income before depreciation and amortization 
we define after tax cash flow as income loss before extraordinary item minus gain loss on disposal of assets net of income tax plus depreciation and amortization 
ebitda and after tax cash flow for the year ended december  excludes a million charge million  net of income tax for a one time stock grant concurrent with parent s initial public offering on june  although broadcast cash flow  ebitda and after tax cash flow are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles  we believe that broadcast cash flow  ebitda and after tax cash flow are useful because they are generally recognized by the radio broadcasting industry as measures of performance and are used by analysts who report on the performance of broadcast companies 
these measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies 
in the following discussion of our results of operations  we compare our results between periods on an as reported basis that is  the results of operations of all radio stations and network formats owned or operated at any time during either period and on a same station basis 
we include in our same station comparisons the results of operations of radio stations and networks that we own or operate in the same format during the current period compared with the results of the same stations for the corresponding period of the prior year 
we do not include a station or a network in the comparison unless it has been owned or operated for at least an entire quarter included in each of the current and corresponding prior year periods

recent developments following the terrorist attacks on the united states on september   we increased the news and community service programming on our radio stations  reducing the amount of broadcast time available for commercial advertising 
in addition  certain advertisers cancelled their advertising time 
as a consequence of these events  our financial results were adversely affected 
further acts of war or terrorism against the united states as well as the united states response to the attacks  including current military developments in afghanistan  and future security threats may continue to affect our business operations and those of our advertisers and other customers 
we cannot predict the further negative effects these events may have on our business operations 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed acquisitions of radio stations through borrowings  including borrowings under credit facilities and  to a lesser extent  from operating cash flow and selected asset dispositions 
we received million from our initial public offering in july  which was used to repay a portion of our senior subordinated notes due and amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
we have historically funded  and will continue to fund  expenditures for operations  administrative expenses  capital expenditures and debt service required by our credit facility and the senior subordinated notes from operating cash flow and borrowings under our credit facility 
we will fund future acquisitions from cash on hand  borrowings under our credit facility  sales of existing radio stations and operating cash flow 
we believe that cash on hand  cash flow from operations  and borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to permit us to meet our financial obligations  fund pending acquisitions and fund operations for at least the next twelve months

net cash provided by financing activities decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to decreased borrowings for acquisitions and repayments of long term debt during the year ended december credit facility 
holdco is the borrower under our credit facility 
at december   million was outstanding under the credit facility 
the credit facility was amended as of december  the description of the credit facility as set forth below reflects the terms of the amendment 
the borrowing capacity under the credit facility was decreased from million to million and the financial ratio tests were modified to provide holdco with additional borrowing flexibility 
the credit facility matures on june  aggregate commitments under the credit facility begin to decrease commencing march  in june  holdco used the net proceeds of the offering of the senior subordinated notes due to repay approximately million of borrowings under the credit facility 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at a base rate  at holdco s option  of the bank s prime rate or libor  plus a spread 
for purposes of determining the interest rate under the credit facility  the prime rate spread ranges from to  and the libor spread ranges from to 
the maximum amount that holdco may borrow under the credit facility is limited by a ratio of our consolidated existing total adjusted debt to pro forma twelve month cash flow the total adjusted funded debt to cash flow ratio 
the credit facility will allow us to adjust our total debt as used in such calculation by the lesser of of the aggregate purchase price of acquisitions of newly acquired non religious formatted radio stations that we reformat to a religious talk  conservative talk or religious music format or million and the cash flow from such stations will not be considered in the calculation of the ratio 
the maximum total adjusted funded debt to cash flow ratio allowed under the credit facility is to through december  thereafter  the maximum ratio will decline periodically until december   at which point it will remain at to through june the total adjusted funded debt to cash flow ratio under the credit facility at december   on a pro forma basis  was to  resulting in a borrowing availability of approximately million 
the credit facility contains additional restrictive covenants customary for credit facilities of the size  type and purpose contemplated which  with specified exceptions  limits our ability to enter into affiliate transactions  pay dividends  consolidate  merge or effect certain asset sales  make specified investments  acquisitions and loans and change the nature of our business 
the credit facility also requires us to satisfy specified financial covenants  which covenants require us on a consolidated basis to maintain specified financial ratios and comply with certain financial tests  including ratios for maximum leverage as described  minimum interest coverage initially upon completion of the offering of the old notes  not less than to  thereafter increasing periodically until january   at which point it will remain at to until june  minimum debt service coverage a static ratio of not less than to  a maximum consolidated senior leverage ratio a static ratio of to  and minimum fixed charge coverage a static ratio of not less than to 
as of december   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
we and all of our subsidiaries  except for holdco  are guarantors of borrowings under the credit facility 
the credit facility is secured by pledges of all of our and our subsidiaries assets and all of the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
initial public offering 
we received net proceeds of million from our initial public offering in july  which was used to pay a portion of the notes and amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
senior subordinated notes due in september  we issued million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due in july  we repurchased million in principal amount of those notes with a portion of the net proceeds of our initial public offering 
as a result of this repurchase  we incurred a non cash charge of million for the write off of unamortized bond issue costs 
this was in addition to the million premium paid in connection with this repurchase 
in august  holdco assumed the indenture governing the existing notes in connection with the assignment of substantially all of our assets and liabilities to holdco  including the obligations as successor issuer under that indenture 
the indenture for the notes contains restrictive covenants that  among others  limit the incurrence of debt by holdco and its subsidiaries  the payment of dividends  the use of proceeds of specified asset sales and transactions with affiliates 
holdco is required to pay million per year in interest on the notes 
we and all of our subsidiaries other than holdco are guarantors of the notes 
senior subordinated notes due in june  holdco issued million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due holdco used the net proceeds to repay approximately million in borrowings under the credit facility 
the indenture for the notes contains restrictive covenants that  among others  limit the incurrence of debt by holdco and its subsidiaries  the payment of dividends  the use of proceeds of specified asset sales and transactions with affiliates 
holdco is required to pay million per year in interest on the notes 
we and all of our subsidiaries other than holdco are guarantors of the notes 
the issuance of the notes places holdco and its subsidiaries close to the maximum indebtedness allowed under the indentures  thus limiting future available indebtedness including additional borrowings under the credit facility

the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  acquisitions of radio station and network assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  barter transactions and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions of radio station and network assets most of our radio station acquisitions have consisted primarily of the fcc licenses to broadcast in a particular market 
we often do not acquire the existing format  or we change the format upon acquisition when we find it beneficial 
as a result  a substantial portion of the purchase price for the assets of a radio station is allocated to the fcc license 
it is generally our policy to retain third party appraisers to value radio stations  networks or other media businesses under consideration for acquisition 
the allocations assigned to acquired fcc licenses and other assets are subjective by their nature and require our careful consideration and judgment 
we believe the allocations represent appropriate estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired 
as part of the valuation and appraisal process  the third party appraisers prepare reports which assign values to the various asset categories in our financial statements 
our management reviews these reports for reasonableness 
the reports form the basis to record the acquisition of the radio station  network or other media business at the close of the transaction 
when we exchange assets  we consider whether the exchange is an exchange of a business or otherwise requires the assets received to be recorded at fair value with the recognition of a gain or loss on the transaction  or the exchange is an exchange of similar productive assets that should be recorded on a historical cost basis with no gain or loss recorded 
in accordance with purchase accounting methodology  the operating results of the acquired assets and businesses are included in the consolidated operating results since the dates of acquisition 
allowance for bad debt we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
an analysis is performed by applying various percentages based on the age of the receivable and performing other subjective analysis 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the likelihood of ultimate realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
intangible assets under the financial accounting standards board s new rules statement of accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we will no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  but will perform annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
we believe our fcc licenses have indefinite lives under the new standard and accordingly amortization expense will no longer be recorded for our fcc licenses as well as our goodwill effective july  for assets acquired subsequent to june  and effective january  for all other assets 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of application of the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
is expected to result in an increase in net income of approximately million per share per year based on the intangible assets mainly fcc licenses currently included in the december  balance sheet 
barter in the broadcasting industry  radio stations often utilize trade or barter agreements to exchange advertising time for goods or services such as other media advertising  travel or lodging  in lieu of cash 
it is our general policy not to preempt advertising paid for in cash with advertising paid for in trade 
for financial reporting purposes  advertising by the radio stations exchanged for goods and services is recorded as the advertising is broadcast and is valued at the estimated value of goods or services received or to be received 
the value of the goods and services received in such barter transactions is charged to expense when used 
the estimated fair value of the barter advertising provided versus barter expenses are approximately the same 
barter advertising provided and barter expenses incurred are included net in broadcasting operating expenses 
valuation allowance deferred taxes for financial reporting purposes  the company has recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december  to offset a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards 
management regularly reviews the company s financial forecasts in an effort to determine the realizability of the net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes 
accordingly  the valuation allowance is adjusted periodically based on management s estimate of the benefit the company will receive from such carryforwards 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of application of the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
is expected to result in an increase in net income of approximately million per share per year based on the intangible assets mainly fcc licenses currently included in the december  balance sheet 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
sfas no 
requires companies to separately report discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
on january  the impact of the adoption of the new standard will not have a material impact on the results of operations or financial position of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments 
during the years ended december  and  we did not invest in market risk sensitive instruments 
market risk 
borrowings under the credit facility are subject to market risk exposure  specifically to changes in libor and in the prime rate in the united states 
as of december   on a pro forma basis  we could borrow up to an additional million under the credit facility 
at december   we had borrowed million under the credit facility 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at a base rate  at our option  of the bank s prime rate or libor  plus a spread 
for purposes of determining the interest rate under the credit facility  the prime rate spread ranges from to  and the libor spread ranges from to 
at december   the blended interest rate on amounts outstanding under our credit facility was 
at december   a hypothetical basis point increase in the prime rate would result in additional interest expense of million on an annualized basis 
in addition to the variable rate debt disclosed above  we have fixed rate debt with a carrying value of million relating to the senior subordinated notes due and million relating to the senior subordinated notes due as well as the senior subordinated notes due as of december  and december   respectively  with an aggregate fair value of million as of dectember  we are exposed to changes in the fair value of these financial instruments based on changes in the market rate of interest on this debt 
using mathematical formulas we estimate that a hypothetical increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the aggregate fair value of our notes to approximately million and a hypothetical decrease in the market interest rates would result in the increase in the fair value of our notes to approximately million
