critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment which is typically when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  performance of our obligation is complete  our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and we are reasonably assured of collecting 
if a loss is anticipated on any contract  a provision for the entire loss is made immediately 
determination of these criteria  in some cases  require management s judgments 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
intangible assets 
we review long lived assets and all intangible assets  including goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate  to the carrying amount including associated goodwill and other intangible assets of such operation 
if the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets  then intangible assets are written down first  followed by other long lived assets of the operation  to fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending upon the nature of the assets 
at december   no impairment has been identified 
forecasted cash flows are based upon numerous assumptions used by management  such as revenue growth  margins and asset management 
actual cash flows could differ materially should these assumptions be wrong 
inventory and accounts receivable reserves 
we provide an amount each period for inventory obsolescence and bad debts 
at december   the company had an inventory obsolescence reserve of  and a reserve for bad debts of  determining adequate reserves for both inventory and accounts receivables requires management s judgments 
conditions impacting the marketability of the company s inventory and the collectibility of the company s receivables could cause actual asset write offs to be materially different than the reserve balances as of december  other a significant portion of the company s packaging sales of molded fiber products are to manufacturers of computer peripherals and other consumer products 
as a result  the company believes that its sales are somewhat seasonal  with increased sales in the second half of the year 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations in the last three years 
market risk the following discussion of the company s market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and equity prices 
at december   the company s cash and cash equivalents consisted of bank accounts in us dollars  and their valuation would not be affected by market risk 
the company has two debt instruments where interest is based upon the prime rate and or libor and  therefore  future operations could be affected by interest rate changes  however  the company believes that the market risk of the debt is minimal
