item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by the company s management in their application have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
video lottery and parimutuel revenues are recognized at the time the wagers are made and are net of winning payouts to patrons 
the distributions from these revenues are governed in large part by the west virginia lottery commission and the west virginia racing commission 
after deduction of a administrative fee paid to the west virginia lottery commission  the company receives of the video lottery net win at mountaineer park until such time based upon legislation as an annual predetermined net win threshold based upon west virginia s fiscal year of july june is achieved 
net win in excess of the threshold will be subject to a surcharge and after reduction for the administrative fee and the surcharge  the net win percentage to be received by the company will be 
this reduction in the net win percentage to be retained by the company will be recognized by the company in the period in which the net win exceeds the predetermined threshold 
accounting for the change in the net win percentage to be retained by the company in this manner ensures that revenue is being recognized when all services have been rendered and the amount is fixed or determinable 
revenues from food and beverage are recognized at the time of sale and revenues from lodging are recognized on the date of stay 
other revenues are recorded at the time the services are rendered or sales are completed 
lodging  food and beverage gratuitously provided to customers are not recognized as revenues 
impairment of long lived assets and intangibles the company reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets including goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable and annually effective in for goodwill 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of the company s assets and result in an impairment charge 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
fair value can be estimated utilizing a number of techniques including quoted market prices  prices for comparable assets  or other valuation processes involving estimates of cash flows  multiples of earnings or revenues  etc 
at december  the company further evaluated the financial performance and the carrying value of the property and equipment at the reno property 
based upon this evaluation the company determined that the assets were impaired and wrote them down by million to estimated fair value 
in determining its estimate of fair value management considered recent property sales  current property listings and its estimates of future cash flows related to this location 
the fair value of these assets  as well as other assets  could be different using different estimates and assumptions in the valuation techniques 
frequent players program members of the frequent players program can accumulate points for casino wagering that can be redeemed for tokens  lodging  food and beverage and merchandise 
a liability is recorded for the estimate of unredeemed points based upon the company s redemption history 
changes to the program  increases in membership and changes in the redemption patterns of the participants could have an impact on this liability in the year of change 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the bases used for financial reporting and income tax reporting of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company has not provided for a valuation allowance at december  because we feel that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future operations 
newly issued accounting standards in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations  for a disposal of a segment of a business 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier application encouraged 
the company expects to adopt fas as of january  and it does not expect that the adoption of the statement will have a significant impact 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with sfas no 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the company will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of application of the nonamortization provisions of sfas no 
is expected to result in an increase in net income of approximately  per year 
during  the company will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january   and has not yet determined what the effect of these tests will be on the earnings and financial position of the company 
results of operations the company anticipates that mountaineer park  particularly gaming operations  will continue to be the dominant factor in the company s financial condition 
during  the company continued with its massive expansion project at mountaineer park 
this expansion has affected operations and operating results in several different ways 
first  management believes that despite record numbers of patrons visiting mountaineer park during  others were dissuaded by noise and disruption from construction and large crowds and a shortage of available slot machines  particularly on the weekends 
second  mountaineer park s operating costs during reflect some front loading related to the launch of the convention center  gaming room and additional food and beverage operations  as well as the new hotel and retail plaza 
third  supplier delays in both installation of additional slot machines and the full implementation of the increased wager affected results 
finally  and most significant  management does not expect optimum efficiency of performance from the existing operations at mountaineer park until the remainder of phase ii of the expansion ie the convention center  the new game room and the room hotel is completed and absorbed 
for example  management does not expect to maximize the performance of the harv  the spa or the new buffet until mountaineer park develops a steady convention business 
likewise  the convention center is not expected to achieve its potential until completion of the hotel 
all of these amenities are designed to drive parimutuel and slot wagering  particularly during what have traditionally been off peak operating hours 
accordingly  management anticipates that a greater percentage of revenue growth will be realized as operating income and net income as phase ii is completed 
implementation of longer range plans  such as a championship golf course  an rv park  housing  equestrian trails  and a shopping village should also have a positive impact on operating results and efficiencies 
the company received a renewal of its speedway property gaming license on october  for a two year period 
the company expects the financial performance of the las vegas property to continue to improve 
in july  the company closed the  square foot casino and one restaurant at the reno property 
the hotel and remaining food and beverage services will continue to operate 
at december  the company wrote down the property and equipment value by million 
the company continues to monitor the operating performance of the reno property and evaluate its options 
see note to the consolidated financial statements

gaming revenues were million for for the reno property up to the date of closing 
the sources of the remaining revenues at the nevada properties for were million from lodging a  decrease from  million from food and beverage  decrease from and  in other income 
the declines are principally attributable to the closing of the casino and restaurant at the reno property 
gaming operations revenues from gaming operations increased from million in to million in management attributes this increase to the following factors the increase in machine count from an average of  during to an average of  during  the opening of new gaming space both to accommodate additional machines and to alleviate crowding  increases in foot traffic driven by new amenities as mountaineer park becomes a destination resort  the increased contributions of gaming revenues from the nevada properties  continued aggressive marketing and promotions  and the continued growth in the popularity of our coin drop mechanical reel slot machines 
management had anticipated a further substantial increase in gaming revenue from mountaineer park as a result of a amendment of the lottery act increasing the maximum slot wager from to however  delays by third party equipment suppliers in delivering new machines and converting existing machines to accept the new maximum wager have delayed the full implementation and financial impact of this legislative enhancement 
the company is working diligently with the manufacturers and the lottery commission to fully implement the new wager limit as soon as possible  but the company does not have a firm commitment for the timing 
for the twelve months ended december   average daily net win for the track based gaming machines was per machine including for non racing days when those gaming rooms were closed  compared to earned on the lodge based terminals for a facility wide average of per machine per day

management expects this trend to continue based upon the following growth drivers full implementation and advertising of the new maximum wager  expanding the geographical reach of the company s target markets with the opening of the new hotel rooms  expanded use of progressive jackpots  increased foot traffic in the casino as a result of convention and event business  and further increases in machine count  subject to regulatory approval 
the company began operating gaming at its two nevada properties on october  the speedway property had gaming revenues of  for  an increase of million or over during july  the company discontinued its gaming operations at the reno property 
the reno property s gaming revenues were million during  a decrease of  or versus the company continues to believe that with an ongoing aggressive advertising campaign and the pursuit of greater market share  the revenues for the speedway property will increase 
the company will not generate gaming revenue from the reno property 
parimutuel commissions parimutuel commissions revenue is a function of wagering handle  which means the total amount wagered without regard to predetermined deductions  with a higher commission earned on a more exotic wager  such as a trifecta  than on a single horse wager  such as a win  place  or show bet 
in parimutuel wagering  patrons bet against each other rather than against the operator of the facility or with pre set odds 
the total wagering handle is composed of the amounts wagered by each individual according to the wagering activity 
the total amounts wagered form a pool of funds from which winnings are paid based on odds determined solely by the wagering activity 
the racetrack acts as a stakeholder for the wagering patrons and deducts from the amounts wagered a take out or gross commission  from which the racetrack pays state and county taxes and racing purses 
the company s parimutuel commission rates are fixed as a percentage of the total wagering handle or total amounts wagered 
the company earned an average commission rate of in each of the past three years 
parimutuel commissions for the twelve months ended december  and are summarized below 
twelve months ended december live racing parimutuel handle   simulcast racing parimutuel handle   less patrons winning tickets   revenues export simulcast   state and county parimutuel tax   purses and horsemen s association   revenues parimutuel   because of the increase in the average daily purses from  in to  in  increasing the number of live race days from the mandated days to days in days in  and the expansion of export simulcasting  total revenues for parimutuel commissions for the year ending december  increased in comparison to live racing handle decreased to million in from million in import simulcast handle in increased by 
million to million in comparison to the same period in commissions for export simulcast  implemented on august   were million for  an increase of million or over the million for the increase in parimutuel revenues is due to expansion of exporting of the simulcast signal  which is ahead of management s expectations 
the increase in purses consisting of statutorily determined percentages of live racing handle and horsemen s association costs of million is attributable principally to the increase in export simulcasting revenues 
additional contributions to racing purses equal to of net win from video lottery operations as required by statute are charged to gaming operations 
parimutuel commissions revenue is reported net of these expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
management remains optimistic that its export simulcast business will continue to grow at least slightly 
the decrease in live handle is attributable to low attendance early in occasioned by poor weather conditions and in part of the third and fourth quarter following the tragic events of september th 
management also believes that some former and potential live racing patrons have become export patrons or have availed themselves of other account wagering alternatives 
the commencement of export simulcasting did involve substantial capital improvements approximately million 
in december of  mountaineer park and its horsemen executed an agreement the enforceability of which was ultimately clarified in the racing statute in march with respect to the sharing of the cost of such capital improvements 
see operating costs  parimutuel commission operating costs  and liquidity and sources of capital 
lodging  food and beverage for the year ended december   revenues from lodging  food and beverage were million  which represents an increase of million or compared to revenues of million for the same period in restaurant  bar and concession facilities throughout the company accounted for the revenue increase at mountaineer park  food and beverage revenues increased million to million from million in management believes that increased revenues from food and beverage at mountaineer park resulted primarily from expanded gaming facilities  opening of the convention center and advertising and promotions  which in turn led to larger patron volume  as well as the july opening of the seat buffet in the speakeasy gaming saloon 
food  beverage and lodging revenue decreased  at the nevada properties due principally to the closing of the restaurant and casino in july at the reno property 
management expects lodging  food and beverage revenues to increase with the opening of the new hotel and related dining facilities at mountaineer park 
other operating revenues other revenues increased by  or from to other sources of revenues consist primarily of the spa operations and other non core businesses such as admission  program sales  golf  special events  such as concerts  professional boxing matches  trade shows  check cashing and atm services 
the spa revenues increased by  in additional entertainment schedules at the harv during resulted in an increase in ticket sales in to  from  in revenues from atm service fees were  in compared to  in operating costs the company s million or increase in revenues was accompanied by higher total costs  as direct operating expenses increased by million or to million in compared to approximately million of the increase in operating costs is attributable to the gaming operations  which includes applicable state taxes and fees 
parimutuel direct costs increased  due to additional simulcast costs and increased salary and benefit costs  while cost of lodging and food and beverage increased by million 
of the increase in the cost of food and beverage and lodging  million can be attributed to the expanded operations at mountaineer park  which was offset by a decline in the cost of food and beverage and lodging at the nevada properties due to closing of the casino and restaurant at the reno property 
the cost of other income increased by million in to million 
the increase is due primarily to costs associated with operating the spa and the convention center  both of which opened in operating costs and gross profits earned from operations for the twelve month periods ended december  and are as follows years ended december operating costs gaming   parimutuel commissions   lodging  food and beverage   other   total operating costs   years ended december gross profit loss gaming   parimutuel commissions   lodging  food and beverage   other   total gross profit   the decline in the gross profit for other is attributable to costs associated with opening and operating the spa and convention center in and operating the harv for the full year in  while full utilization and corresponding revenues are not expected until after the new hotel rooms open in the second quarter of and are absorbed 
gaming operating costs costs of gaming revenue for increased by million or from million to million compared to the year ended december  the increase is in proportion to the increase in revenue 
costs of gaming revenue in west virginia increased by million or to million in  reflecting an increase of million in statutory expenses directly related to the increase in gaming revenues 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the expanded gaming facilities in downtown speakeasy and uptown speakeasy including the high roller fountain room generated increases in patron volume and higher levels of patron play 
this increased activity  implementation of the automated player tracking system and customer service requirements caused an increase in personnel and supplies costs 
as a result  wages and benefits as well as supplies expense increased from to by million 
there was million of gaming expense at the nevada properties in  as compared to million for for the cost of gaming revenue at the reno property decreased by  due to discontinuation of gaming at that location in july the cost of gaming at the speedway property increased by  significantly less than the increase in gaming revenues of million 
under the lottery act  mountaineer park pays the following percentages of net win from slot operations fees  which are accounted for as costs of gaming net terminal income state of west virginia hancock county horseman s association racing purses other total statutory payments excludes a administrative fee charged by the state of west virginia based on revenues 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
in prior years  the state of west virginia annually reconciled the state administrative fee  and the amount not utilized by the state was refunded on june  the end of the state s fiscal year 
in april  west virginia amended its video lottery statute  eliminating the reconciliation and refund of the unused portion of the administrative fee commencing with the state s fiscal year that began july  in prior years  the anticipated refund was accrued throughout the year 
the company believes  however  that even absent the legislative change  the amount of the refund would have decreased substantially  as the lottery commission s administrative expenses will likely increase due to the growth in the state s video lottery program 
the bill also establishes a new distribution scheme for the portion of each racetrack s net win in excess of that racetrack s net win for the twelve months ending june  referred to in the amendment as excess net terminal income 
after deducting the administrative fee  the excess net terminal income will be subject to a surcharge 
the remaining amount of the excess net terminal income will be distributed as follows excess net terminal income state of west virginia hancock county horseman s association racing purses other total statutory payments excludes a administrative fee charged by the state of west virginia based on revenues  and effective july  as discussed above  a surcharge once certain levels of revenues are achieved 
in addition  rates are applied to revenues net of this administrative fee and the surcharge when applicable 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
after deducting the administrative fee and the surcharge from the excess net terminal income  the racetracks will receive as opposed to of the remaining net win 
for mountaineer park  the threshold for excess net terminal income is approximately million  which  based upon the state s june fiscal year end  the company anticipates exceeding in april through june of the amended lottery act creates a separate capital reinvestment fund for each racetrack to which the state will contribute of the surcharge attributable to each racetrack 
generally  for each dollar a racetrack expends on eligible capital improvements for the racetrack and adjacent property  the track will receive a dollar from the capital reinvestment fund 
depending upon the amount of a project  any amount expended in excess of the balance in the capital reinvestment fund may be carried forward three subsequent years 
statutory costs and assessments excluding the state administrative fee for the respective twelve month periods ended december and are as follows years ended december employee pension fund   horseman s purse fund   subtotal   state of west virginia   tourism promotion fund   hancock county   stakes races   miscellaneous state projects   total   parimutuel commissions operating costs total costs of parimutuel operations of million for increased  as compared to due to the demand for our signal  the racing schedule was extended to days resulting in an increase in operating costs 
direct and indirect wages and employee benefits attributable to racing operations increased by  to approximately million in due to the increased race days  expanded hours of otb operations trackside  contractual increase in salaries and increases in health care costs 
export signal transmission cost increased  in as compared to due to increased simulcasting activity 
for the year ended december   parimutuel operations showed a gross profit of million versus a loss of  for the dramatic improvement in results from parimutuel operations is attributable principally to a full year of export simulcasting in export simulcasting commenced in august 
export simulcasting represents not only a new source of revenue but also a business that enjoys relatively fixed costs as revenues increase as compared to parimutuel wagering on live racing or import simulcasting 
although this new business has progressed faster than management anticipated  the growing popularity of the product leads management to believe that results from parimutuel operations will continue to improve in the next year  although not at the same level as in and lodging  food and beverage operating costs direct expenses of lodging  food and beverage operations increased from million in to million in of the million increase in expenses  a decrease of  is attributable to the nevada properties 
company wide  food and beverage direct costs increased by million to million for a loss of  in as compared to the loss of million in the decrease in the loss for food and beverage is attributable to the closing of the restaurant at the reno property in july lodging direct costs totaled million for compared to million in resulting in a gross profit of  in versus  in mountaineer park s gross profit for food  beverage and lodging was  in compared to  in the increase in gross profit is attributable to an improvement in the gross profit of lodging of  due to increase in revenues  as a result of higher occupancy levels and a reduction in salaries and other costs of lodging 
the nevada properties reported an operating loss from food  beverage and lodging of  for as compared to a loss of  for this increase is attributed primarily to higher costs of wages and related benefits at the speedway property and a decline in lodging revenues of the reno property  which were partially offset by the reduction in food and beverage costs at the reno property  due to the closing of the restaurant in reno 
costs of other operating revenues costs of other revenues  consisting primarily of the non core businesses such as the spa  special event ticket sales  racing programs  golf and check cashing  increased by from million in to million in this increase can be attributed primarily to a  increase in the cost of events held at the harv due to its full year of operation in  the february opening of the spa  which had operating costs of  and the opening of the convention center in august  which had operating costs of  and an increase in check cashing service costs of  management believes that the costs associated with amenities such as the harv  the spa and the convention center will drive higher corresponding revenues after completion of the hotel expansion because of anticipated increases in convention sales and mid week gaming and parimutuel business 
marketing and promotions expense company wide  based on increases at mountaineer park and decreases for the nevada properties  marketing and promotions expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for marketing and promotions expenses constituted of gross revenues in comparison to for marketing and promotions expenses at mountaineer park increased by million from million in to million in the increase can be attributable to dramatic increases in the number of members of mountaineer park s player s club and increase in prize giveaways through this promotion  the increase in group sales  gaming and other departmental promotional costs million  and the marketing partnership with the pittsburgh penguins hockey team and other sponsorships 
in marketing and promotion expense for the nevada properties decreased by  due principally to the july closing of the casino and restaurant at the reno property 
general and administrative expenses and interest general and administrative expenses for the year ending december  increased by million  or from million in general and administrative costs for constituted of gross revenues in comparison to for the increase in general and administrative costs can be attributed to two areas 
first  with respect to operations the increases are due primarily to increases in costs of security  surveillance  housekeeping and maintenance attributable to the expanded facilities new gaming areas  the harv  convention center  spa  buffet  etc 
and the corresponding increase in patron traffic million  increases in employee benefits  such as health insurance million  increases in insurance costs  and increases in administrative costs such as salaries  consulting and other miscellaneous costs 
second  professional fees and expenses were incurred as the company pursued its business strategy to acquire other gaming and or parimutuel businesses and in connection with general corporate matters resulting in an increase of  to million in as compared to million in interest expense increased by 
million to million in  from million in this increase to million is attributable to the increase in borrowings under the company s credit facility and capital lease financing arrangements 
see liquidity and sources of capital 
depreciation and amortization costs increased by from million in to million in this increase reflects the million increase in fixed assets  other than for construction in progress  and including the capital leasing of new gaming devices 
additional depreciation expense was incurred from new facilities  including the convention center and the new gaming room  which should be more fully utilized as the new hotel rooms open 
depreciation for the nevada properties was million for  an increase of  as compared to during july the company closed a dining room and discontinued gaming operations at the reno property due to poor financial performance

the sources of the remaining revenues for were million from lodging a  increase over  million from food and beverage million increase from and  in other income 
gaming operations revenues from gaming operations increased from million in to million in management attributes the dramatic increase to the following factors the increase in machine count from  to  by the opening of the new downtown speakeasy gaming room in august of  increases in foot traffic driven by new amenities as mountaineer park becomes a destination resort  the increasing contributions of gaming revenues from the nevada properties  continued aggressive marketing and the growing popularity of our coin drop mechanical reel slot machines

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from its long term debt arrangements 
under its current policies  the company uses interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes for a portion of its debt arrangements 
taking into account the effects of interest rate derivatives designated as hedges  a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would have limited effect on the net fair value of all interest sensitive financial instruments at december
