item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we own a portfolio of upscale  full service hotels in the united states and canada 
our portfolio is diversified by franchise and brand affiliations 
as of december   we owned hotels  with  rooms  all of which were leased by our taxable subsidiaries and managed by meristar hotels resorts  inc prior to january   in order to maintain our tax status as a reit  we were not permitted to participate in the operations of our hotel properties 
to comply with this requirement through december   all of our properties were subject to leases involving two third party lessees  meristar hotels and prime hospitality corporation 
on january   changes to the federal tax laws governing reits became effective 
those changes are commonly known as the reit modernization act  or rma 
the rma permits real estate investment trusts to create taxable subsidiaries that are subject to taxation similar to subchapter c corporations 
we have created a number of these taxable subsidiaries to lease our real property 
the rma prohibits our taxable subsidiaries from engaging in the following activities 
managing the properties they lease our taxable subsidiaries must enter into an arm s length management agreement with an independent third party manager that is actively involved in the trade or business of hotel management and manages properties on behalf of other owners  
leasing a property that contains gambling operations  and 
owning a brand or franchise 
we believe establishing taxable subsidiaries to lease the properties we own provides a more efficient alignment of and ability to capture the economic interests of property ownership 
under the prior lease structure with meristar hotels  we received lease payments based on the revenues generated by the properties  meristar hotels  however  operated the properties in order to maximize net operating income from the properties 
this inconsistency could potentially result in the properties being operated in a way that did not maximize revenues 
with the assignment of the leases from meristar hotels to our taxable subsidiaries and the execution of the new management agreements as described below  we gained the economic risks and rewards usually associated with ownership of real estate  and property revenues became the basis for meristar hotels management fees 
subsidiaries of meristar hotels assigned the participating leases to our wholly owned taxable subsidiaries as of january  in connection with the assignment  the taxable subsidiaries executed new management agreements with a subsidiary of meristar hotels to manage our hotels 
under these management agreements  the taxable subsidiaries pay a management fee to meristar hotels for each property 
the taxable subsidiaries in turn make rental payments to us under the participating leases 
the management agreements have been structured to substantially mirror the economics of the former leases 
the assignment of the leases from meristar hotels to our taxable subsidiaries did not result in any cash consideration exchanged among the parties except for the transfer of hotel operating assets and liabilities to the taxable subsidiaries 
under the new management agreements  the base management fee is of total hotel revenue 
meristar hotels can also earn incentive management fees  based on meeting performance thresholds  of up to of total hotel revenue 
the agreements have an initial term of years with three renewal periods of five years each at the option of meristar hotels  subject to some exceptions 
because these leases have been assigned to our taxable subsidiaries  we now bear the operating risk associated with our hotels 
during  we acquired the eight leases from prime hospitality for our hotels that were previously leased and managed by prime 
these hotels are managed by meristar hotels 
the management agreements with meristar hotels are identical to the other management agreements between meristar hotels and us except that the term on four of the agreements is one year with additional one year renewal periods 
the terrorist attacks of september  have had a severely negative impact on our hotel operations in the third and fourth quarter  causing lower than expected performance in an already slowing economy 
the events of september have caused a significant decrease in our hotels occupancy and average daily rate due to disruptions in business and leisure travel patterns 
our major metropolitan area and airport hotels have been particularly affected due to concerns about air travel safety and a significant overall decrease in the amount of air travel 
in response to the decline in operations following the terrorist attacks  we have worked with meristar hotels to aggressively review and reduce our hotels cost structure 
we have implemented numerous cost cutting strategies  including the following items 
reducing overall staffing  and reducing hours for remaining hourly staff  
instituting hiring and wage freezes for all properties  
revising operating procedures to gain greater efficiencies and or reduce costs  
closing underutilized or duplicative facilities and outlets  
creating revised minimum staffing guides for each department in our hotels  and 
reducing capital expenditures to focus primarily on life safety requirements  and deferring or terminating discretionary capital outlays 
the september  terrorist attacks were unprecedented in scope  and in their immediate  dramatic impact on travel patterns 
we have not previously experienced such events  and it is currently not possible to accurately predict if and when travel patterns will be restored to pre september levels 
while we have had improvements in our operating levels from the period immediately following the attacks  we believe the uncertainty associated with subsequent incidents and the possibility of future attacks will continue to hamper business and leisure travel patterns for the next several quarters 
in addition  the september  terrorist attacks have had a dramatic effect on the insurance and reinsurance industries 
many companies are being subject to losses or cancellations of insurance polices  or renewals of existing coverage but with extreme price increases 
at our insurance policy renewals in mid  we may be subject to restrictions as compared to our current coverages  price increases  or a combination of both restrictions and increases 
on may   we and our operating partnership entered into an agreement and plan of merger with felcor lodging trust incorporated and its operating partnership 
on september  the sec declared the s registration statement filed by felcor effective 
on september   we mutually agreed with felcor to terminate the merger agreement due to unfavorable market conditions 
we incurred million of costs related to this merger through december  and these costs have been expensed in our statement of operations 
during the third quarter of  we incurred a restructuring charge in connection with personnel changes primarily as a result of the termination of our merger agreement with felcor 
this restructuring is expected to reduce our annualized corporate overhead expenditures by approximately  or million 
the restructuring included eliminating corporate staff positions and office space no longer needed under the new structure 
critical accounting policies preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairment of long lived assets and the recording of certain accrued liabilities 
some of our estimates are material to the financial statements 
these estimates are therefore particularly sensitive as future events could cause the actual results to be significantly different from our estimates 
our critical accounting policies are as follows 
impairment of long lived assets  
estimating certain accrued liabilities  and 
determining the impact of future interest rate changes on our statement of operations 
impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets including property and equipment and all intangibles may be impaired  we perform an analysis to determine the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
the carrying value of the asset includes the original purchase price net of depreciation plus the value of all capital improvements net of depreciation 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  we write down the asset to its estimated fair value and recognize an impairment loss 
the estimated fair value is based on what we estimate the current sale price of the asset to be based on comparable sales information or other estimates of the asset s value 
any impairment losses we recognize are recorded as operating expenses 
in  we recognized million of impairment losses 
we did not recognize any impairment losses in or we review long lived assets for impairment when one or more of the following events have occurred a 
current or immediate short term future twelve months projected cash flows are significantly less than the most recent historical cash flows 
b 
the unplanned departure of an executive officer or other key personnel which could adversely affect our ability to maintain our competitive position and manage future growth 
c 
a significant adverse change in legal factors or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  which could affect the value of our long lived assets 
d 
events which could cause significant adverse changes and uncertainty in business and leisure travel patterns 
we make estimates of the undiscounted cash flows from the expected future operations of the asset 
in projecting the expected future operations of the asset  we base our estimates on future budgeted earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  amounts and use growth assumptions to project these amounts out over the expected life of the underlying asset 
our growth assumptions are based on assumed future improvements in the national economy and improvements in demand for lodging  if actual conditions differ from those in our assumptions  the actual results of each asset s actual future operations could be significantly different from the estimated results we used in our analysis 
our operating results are also subject to the risks set forth under risk factors operating risks 
estimating certain accrued liabilities estimates for certain accruals such as real and personal property taxes could have a material effect on our financial statements 
currently  we estimate real and personal property taxes based on a combination of preliminary estimates from state and local jurisdictions and historical information 
the assessed values of these properties could change significantly from the values or rates we use in our estimates 
property tax assessments are subject to periodic and often lengthy appeals 
for example  in instances where a jurisdiction increases our assessed value  we frequently appeal that assessment 
similarly  when hotel operations decline  we may appeal an assessment as too high if it is based on past operating results 
these appeals of assessed values are subject to a potentially wide range of outcomes 
as a result of the economic slowdown and events of september   we have filed a number of appeals for lower assessments 
as of december   we had ongoing appeals in several jurisdictions with respect to more than properties 
we accrue for these liabilities based on our judgment of the most reasonably likely outcome of the appeals 
if we were unsuccessful in all of our current appeals  we would have to recognize approximately million of additional expense 
we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these appeals  or their effect on our accruals for such items 
also  actual property tax expense could vary greatly from our estimates used for the current property tax accrual based on a change in the assessed value  a change in the tax rate  and or a different outcome of the appeals process than we currently expect 
determining impact of future interest rate changes on our statement of operations fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  requires a company to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and record those instruments at fair value 
fas no 
and no 
amended certain provisions of fas no 
we adopted these accounting pronouncements effective january  our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
we assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging purposes 
our interest rate swap agreements were initially designated as hedges against changes in future cash flows associated with specific variable rate debt obligations 
as of december   we had three swap agreements with notional amounts totaling million 
a portion of these swap agreements million provide cash flow hedges on our floating london interbank offered rate or libor rate debt payments 
the remaining swap agreements million have been converted to non hedging derivatives due to our repayment of the floating rate borrowings they originally hedged and they are currently being marked to market through our statement of operations 
for our swap agreements that provide hedges against future cash flows  the related change in fair value is recorded as unrealized gains or losses in our stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
for the portion of our swaps that were redesignated to non hedging derivatives  the related change in fair value is recorded as realized gains or losses in our statement of operations 
we have interest rate exposure going forward as the change in fair value of our non hedging derivatives will have an impact on our statement of operations 
for more information regarding our interest rate hedging activities  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
financial condition december  compared with december  our total assets decreased by million to  million at december  from  million at december  primarily due to 
the decrease of million in due from meristar hotels  
the sale of two hotels and the use of the million in proceeds to pay down debt  and 
depreciation on hotel assets  partially offset by 
the note receivable from meristar hotels for million  
capital expenditures of million at the hotels  and 
the increase in operating assets of million related to the assignment of the hotel leases with meristar hotels to our taxable subsidiaries 
total liabilities increased by million to  million at december  from  million at december  due mainly to 
net borrowings of long term debt of million  
a million increase in accrued interest due to the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes sold in january  
the adoption of fas no 
and the related recording of a million liability for our derivative instruments  and 
the increase in operating liabilities of million related to the assignment of the hotel leases with meristar hotels and prime hospitality to our taxable subsidiaries  partially offset by 
a decrease of million in dividends and distributions payable due to a lower fourth quarter dividend in the fourth quarter dividend was per share in and per share in long term debt increased by million to  million at december  from  million at december  due primarily to 
million in senior unsecured notes issued in january  
million in senior unsecured notes issued in december  partially offset by 
million of net repayments of our revolving credit facility using proceeds of the senior unsecured notes borrowings and cash generated by operations 
minority interests decreased million to million at december  from million at december   due to 
million of net redemptions of operating partnership units for common stock  
million of current year distributions to minority interest holders  and 
million of current year net losses allocated to minority interest holders  partially offset by 
million of pops awarded to certain employees 
stockholders equity decreased million to  at december  from  million at december  due primarily to 
million of dividends  
million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss due mainly to the adoption of fas no 
 and 
million of net loss for  partially offset by 
million of net redemptions of operating partnership units for common stock 
results of operations year ended december  compared with the year ended december  until january   meristar hotels leased substantially all of our hotels from us 
under the leases  meristar hotels assumed all of the operating risks and rewards of these hotels and paid us a percentage of each hotel s revenue under the lease agreements 
therefore  for financial statement purposes through december   meristar hotels recorded all of the operating revenues and expenses of the hotels in its statements of operations  and we recorded lease revenue earned under the lease agreements in our statement of operations 
effective january   meristar hotels assigned the hotel leases to our newly created  wholly owned  taxable reit subsidiaries  and our taxable reit subsidiaries entered into management agreements with meristar hotels to manage the hotels 
as a result of this change  our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries have assumed the operating risks and rewards of the hotels and now pay meristar hotels a management fee to manage the hotels for us 
for consolidated financial statement purposes  effective january   we now record all of the revenues and expenses of the hotels in our statements of operations  including the management fee paid to meristar hotels 
our total revenues and total operating expenses increased million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in as described in the preceding paragraph  the significant increases primarily result from the fact that we now record the hotel operating revenue and expenses in our consolidated financial statements effective january   while we only recorded lease revenue in as a result  our operating results for the year ended december  are not directly comparable to the same period in for comparative purposes  the following shows the results for the year ended december  on a pro forma basis assuming the leases with meristar hotels were converted to management contracts on january   compared to actual results for the year ended december  in thousands except for per share data revenue   total expenses   minority interest   taxes   net income loss before gain loss on sale of assets and extraordinary items   net income loss   recurring ffo   recurring ffo per share  diluted the following table provides our hotels operating statistics on a same store basis for the years ended december  and change revenue per available room average daily rate occupancy overall  disruptions in business and leisure travel patterns and travel safety concerns due to the terrorist attacks on september   coupled with the slowing united states economy  had a major negative effect on our hotels during the second half of the events have been marked by a sharp reduction in business and leisure travel 
this contributed to the reduction in revenue per available room and the reduction in occupancy for compared to the these reductions became more pronounced during the third and fourth quarters of total revenue decreased million to  million in from  million in due primarily to 
million decrease in room revenue related to the decrease in occupancy  
million decrease in food and beverage revenue due to the decrease in occupancy  and 
million decrease in lease revenue due to a smaller number of leased hotels compared to total expenses increased million to  million for from  million in due primarily to 
million payment to terminate million on interest rate swaps in conjunction with the sale of million of senior unsecured notes and the repayment of related term loans  
million charge to recognize the effect of interest rate swaps that were converted to non hedging derivatives upon the repayment of portions of our senior secured credit facility in december in conjunction with the sale of million of senior unsecured notes  
million loss on asset impairment related to the write down of certain hotel assets 
these write downs resulted from the negative impact of changes in the economic climate on the value of our assets  
million charge to write off our investment in sts hotel net  
million in costs related to our terminated merger with felcor lodging trust  
million in costs to terminate leases with prime hospitality corporation  
million charge due to a restructuring at corporate headquarters  
million increase in depreciation on hotel assets  and 
million increase in property operating costs due primarily to a million increase in energy costs  partially offset by 
million decrease in room expenses due to lower occupancy  and 
million decrease in food and beverage expenses due to lower occupancy 
in  we repaid our term loans under our revolving credit agreement which resulted in an extraordinary loss of million net of tax from the write off of deferred financing costs related to those term loans 
in december we amended the terms of our senior credit agreement 
we incurred million of costs related to the amended agreement of which million represents deferred financing costs and million net of tax resulted in an extraordinary loss 
the white paper on funds from operations  or ffo  approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit in october defines ffo as net income loss  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  also called gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after comparable adjustments for our portion of these items related to unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
extraordinary items under gaap are excluded from the calculation of ffo 
we believe ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flow from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
ffo may include funds that may not be available for management s discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures and property acquisitions  and other commitments and uncertainties 
we use recurring ffo as a measure of our performance 
recurring ffo represents ffo  as defined above  adjusted for significant non recurring items 
the following is a reconciliation between income loss before gain loss on the sale of assets and extraordinary items and recurring ffo on a diluted basis for the years ended december  and in thousands income loss before gain loss on sale of assets and extraordinary items   minority interest to common op unit holders   interest on convertible debt   hotel depreciation and amortization   deferred cost of sale of asset  non recurring items net of minority interests and income taxes swap termination costs  loss on fair value of non hedging derivatives  write down of investment in sts hotel net  loss on asset impairment  felcor merger costs  costs to terminate leases with prime hospitality corporation  restructuring charges  recurring ffo   year ended december  compared with the year ended december  until january  substantially all of our hotels were leased to and operated by meristar hotels 
participating lease revenue represents lease payments from the lessees pursuant to the participating lease agreements 
total revenue increased by million to million in compared to million in this increase was primarily attributable to an increase of million in participating lease revenue resulting from an increase in room revenue at our hotels under lease 
the following table provides our hotels operating statistics on a same store basis for the year change revenue per available room average daily rate occupancy operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in due primarily to 
an increase in depreciation on hotel assets  and 
an increase in administrative costs  as we added personnel during to address the operating changes associated with rma and insurance costs 
net interest expense increased million to million for the year ended december   from million in due mainly to 
lower capitalized interest due to a decrease in qualifying capital expenditures in  
an increase in variable interest rates during and higher interest rates on swap arrangements executed in  partially offset by 
a lower average debt balance during minority interests decreased million to million in from million in due to 
the net redemption of operating partnership units  partially offset by 
the increase in the allocation of income to minority interest holders 
in  we repurchased million of our convertible notes at a discount 
this resulted in an extraordinary gain of million net of tax effect 
in  we sold three limited service hotels and received million 
this resulted in a gain on sale of assets of million million  net of tax 
liquidity and capital resources sources of cash we generated million of cash from operations during our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and funds from external borrowings and debt offerings 
we expect to fund our continuing operations through cash generated by our hotels 
we also expect to finance hotel acquisitions  hotel renovations and joint venture investments through a combination of internally generated cash  external borrowings  and the issuance of op units and or common stock 
factors that may influence our liquidity include 
factors that affect our results of operations  including general economic conditions  demand for business and leisure travel  public concerns about travel safety and other operating risks described under the caption  risk factors our results of operations are dependent on revenues generated by our hotels  which are subject to a number of risks related to the lodging industry  and our current operating structure which became effective as of january  has significantly increased our exposure to those risks  
factors that affect our access to bank financing and the capital markets  including interest rate fluctuations  operational risks and other risks described under the caption risk factors financing risks  and 
the other factors described under the caption  special note regarding forward looking statements 
we must distribute to stockholders at least of our taxable income  excluding net capital gains to preserve the favorable tax treatment accorded to real estate investment trusts under the internal revenue code 
we expect to fund such distributions through cash generated from operations and borrowings on our credit agreement 
in light of the dramatic business declines since the september  terrorist attacks  we expect our taxable income to decrease significantly in any future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be determined by factors including our operating results  capital expenditure requirements  the economic outlook  the internal revenue service dividend payout requirements for reits and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant 
we cannot provide assurance that any such distributions will be made in the future 
uses of cash we used million of cash in investing activities during primarily for 
the million note receivable with meristar hotels  and 
million of capital expenditures at hotels 
these items were partially offset by 
million of hotel operating cash received on lease conversions  and 
million of proceeds from selling two hotels 
we used million of cash in financing activities during primarily for 
million of payments of dividends  and 
million from additional deferred financing costs related to issuing the million and million of senior unsecured notes  
million of distributions to minority investors 
these items were partially offset by 
million of net borrowings of long term debt 
long term debt in january  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes 
these senior unsecured notes are structured as 
million of notes maturing in  and 
million of notes maturing in we used the proceeds from these notes to repay outstanding debt under our revolving credit agreement and to make payments of million to terminate certain swap agreements that hedged variable rates on loans that we repaid 
the repayments of our term loans under our credit facility resulted in an extraordinary loss of million net of tax from the write off of deferred financing costs related to these term loans 
in december  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes 
these notes have a interest rate and mature in june we used the net proceeds to repay outstanding debt under our term loans and revolving credit agreement 
the repayments of our term loans under our credit agreement resulted in an extraordinary loss of million net of tax from the write off of deferred financing costs related to those term loans 
in february  we issued a further million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due we used the proceeds from the issuance of these notes to repay approximately million of the outstanding balance under our revolving credit agreement 
in february  we amended our revolving credit agreement 
the amendment allows us to reduce the revolving commitments to below million 
in march   we reduced the borrowing capacity on our revolving credit agreement from million to million 
minimum payments due under our debt obligations as of december in thousands thereafter  as of february   we had million of debt outstanding under our senior secured credit agreement 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the senior secured credit agreement as of february  was 
our senior credit agreement requires us to meet or exceed certain financial performance ratios at the end of each quarter 
travel disruptions and safety concerns following the terrorist attacks on september  and the slowdown of the national economy resulted in a significant negative impact to the lodging industry and our operations 
this decline in operations would have caused us to be out of compliance with certain financial covenants specified in our senior credit agreement 
on october   however  we finalized a temporary waiver on all affected financial covenants with our senior bank group and engaged in discussions to amend our senior credit agreement further 
this waiver to the credit agreement allowed these financial covenants to be waived for the period beginning september  and ending february  in december we amended our senior credit agreement 
this amendment relaxed our financial covenants and allows us to extend the maturity date on our credit facility from july to july we incurred million of costs related to the amendment 
capital resources we must make ongoing capital expenditures in order to keep our hotels competitive in their markets 
we expect a combination of internally generated cash and external borrowings to provide capital for renovation work 
initial renovation programs for most of our hotels are complete or nearing completion 
once initial renovation programs for a hotel are completed  we expect to spend approximately of hotel revenues annually for ongoing capital expenditure programs 
these ongoing programs will include room and facilities refurbishments  renovations  and furniture and equipment replacements 
for the year ended december   we spent million on renovation and ongoing property capital expenditure programs 
we intend to spend approximately million during for our ongoing capital expenditure programs 
in response to the decline in our operations following the september  terrorist attacks  we have significantly curtailed our capital expenditure programs 
we have taken the following steps 
re prioritized all capital expenditures to focus nearly exclusively on life safety requirements  
deferred or canceled all discretionary capital expenditures that did not cause us to incur a substantial penalty  and 
reviewed our estimated capital requirements in light of the revised business levels we are currently experiencing 
we will continue to monitor our capital requirements as compared to business levels  and will revise expenditures as necessary 
we believe cash generated by operations  together with anticipated borrowing capacity under our senior credit agreements  will be sufficient to fund our existing working capital requirements  ongoing capital expenditures  and debt service requirements 
we believe  however  that our future capital decisions will also be made in response to specific acquisition and or investment opportunities  depending on conditions in the capital and or other financial markets 
seasonality demand in the lodging industry is affected by recurring seasonal patterns 
for non resort properties  demand is lower in the winter months due to decreased travel and higher in the spring and summer months during peak travel season 
for resort properties  demand is generally higher in winter and early spring 
since the majority of our hotels are non resort properties  our operations generally reflect non resort seasonality patterns 
we have lower revenue  operating income and cash flow in the first and fourth quarters and higher revenue  operating income and cash flow in the second and third quarters  although the disruptions caused by the september  attacks and their aftermath may cause disruptions to this pattern 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations that impact the fair value of these obligations 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objectives  we borrow at a combination of fixed and variable rates  and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
we have no cash flow exposure due to general interest rate changes for our fixed long term debt obligations 
the table below presents  as of december   the principal amounts in thousands of dollars for our fixed and variable rate debt instruments  weighted average interest rates  and fair values by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
long term debt average variable average expected maturity fixed rate interest rate rate interest rate  n a  n a  n a  n a thereafter  n a total   fair value at   upon the issuance of our million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in december  we reduced the term loans and our revolver under our senior secured credit agreement by an aggregate amount of million 
at that time  we converted three swap agreements to non hedging derivatives 
these swap agreements had notional principal amounts of approximately million and were originally designated to hedge variable rate borrowings under our senior secured credit facility that were repaid 
we recognized a million loss related to this swap conversion 
upon the issuance of our million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in january  we reduced the term loans under our senior secured credit agreement by million 
at that time  we terminated three swap agreements with a notional amount of million 
these swap agreements were originally designated to hedge variable rate term loans that were repaid 
we made net payments totaling million to our counter parties to terminate these swap agreements  and recognized a million loss related to those terminated swaps 
as of december   we had three swap agreements with notional principal amounts totaling million 
a portion of these swap agreements million provide hedges against the impact future interest rates have on our floating london interbank offered rate  or libor rate  debt instruments 
the remaining portion of the swap agreements million has been converted to non hedging derivatives 
the swap agreements effectively fix the day libor between and 
the swap agreements expire between december and july for the years ended december  and  we have made received net payments of approximately  and  respectively 
in anticipation of the august completion of our mortgage backed secured facility  we entered into two separate hedge transactions during july upon completion of the secured facility  we terminated the underlying treasury lock agreements  resulting in a net payment to us of million 
this amount was deferred and is being recognized as a reduction to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt 
as a result  the effective interest rate on the secured facility is 
additionally  in anticipation of the august offering of million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due  we entered into separate hedge transactions during june and july upon completion of the subordinated notes offering  we terminated the underlying swap agreements  resulting in a net payment to us of  this amount was deferred and is being recognized as a reduction to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt 
as a result  the effective interest rate on the subordinated notes is 
as of december   after consideration of the hedge agreements described above  of our debt was fixed and our overall weighted average interest rate was 
although we conduct business in canada  the canadian operations were not material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows during the years ended december   and additionally  foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the years ended december   and accordingly  we were not subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign subsidiaries 
to date  we have not entered into any significant foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
