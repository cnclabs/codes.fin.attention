item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under item business risk factors that may affect results and elsewhere in this report 
we were founded in december from through  we devoted our efforts principally to building  marketing and selling our professional services capabilities and to research and development activities related to our software products 
beginning in  we began to focus on selling our software products 
to date  we have enhanced and released several versions of our atg dynamo products 
we market and sell our products worldwide through our direct sales force  systems integrators  technology partners and original equipment manufacturers 
we derive our revenues from the sale of software product licenses and related services 
product license revenues are derived from the sale of software licenses of our atg dynamo products 
our software licenses are priced based on either the size of the customer implementation or site license terms 
services revenues are derived from fees for professional services  training and software maintenance and support 
professional services include custom application development and project and technical consulting 
we bill professional service fees primarily on a time and materials basis or in some cases  on a fixed price schedule defined specifically in our contracts 
software maintenance and support arrangements are priced based on the level of services provided 
generally  customers are entitled to receive software updates  maintenance releases and technical support for an annual maintenance fee of to of the list price of the licensed product 
customers that purchase maintenance and support generally receive all product updates and upgrades of software modules purchased as well as on line and telephone technical support 
training is billed as services are provided 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
revenues from software product license agreements are recognized upon execution of a license agreement and delivery of the software  provided that the fee is fixed or determinable and deemed collectible by management 
if conditions for acceptance are required subsequent to delivery  revenues are recognized upon customer acceptance if such acceptance is not deemed to be perfunctory 
in multiple element arrangements  we use the residual value method in accordance with sop and sop revenues from software maintenance agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period  which is typically one year 
we enter into reseller arrangements that typically provide for sublicense fees payable to us based upon a percentage of our list price 
revenues are recognized under reseller agreements as earned which is generally ratably over the life of the reseller agreement for guaranteed minimum royalties or based upon unit sales by the resellers 
we do not grant our resellers the right of return or price protection 
revenues from professional service arrangements are recognized on either a time and materials or percentage of completion basis as the services are performed  provided that amounts due from customers are fixed or determinable and deemed collectible by management 
amounts collected prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are reflected as deferred revenue 
unbilled services represent service revenues that have been earned by us in advance of billings 
services revenues have increased primarily due to the expansion of our service capabilities by hiring additional service personnel and the increase in the number of customers using our atg dynamo products 
sales of atg dynamo products often lead to sales of consulting services and software maintenance and support 
to date  substantially all of our dynamo customers have entered into annual software maintenance and support agreements at the time of purchase and have renewed such maintenance and support contracts in subsequent periods 
we believe that growth of our product license sales depends on our ability to provide customers with support  training  consulting and implementation services and to educate systems integrators and resellers on how to use and install our products 
we have invested significantly in expanding our services organization 
we currently maintain offices in australia  canada  england  france  germany  japan  korea  the netherlands  sweden  and the united states 
revenues from customers outside the united states accounted for of our total revenues in  in and in in  we began entering into contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
we currently do not have hedging or similar arrangements to protect us against foreign currency fluctuations 
we  therefore  increasingly may become subject to currency fluctuations  which could harm our operating results in future periods 
critical accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  research and development costs  restructuring expenses  the impairment of long lived assets and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and require management s most difficult and subjective judgments 
revenue recognition not only is revenue recognition a key component of our results of operations  the timing of our revenue recognition also determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions 
in measuring revenues  we follow the specific guidelines of sop and related authoritative literature  as discussed above 
certain judgments of management  however  affect the application of this policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict and any shortfall or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operational results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
we maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  however  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
research and development costs we evaluate the establishment of technological feasibility of our products in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
we sell products in a market that is subject to rapid technological change  new product development and changing customer needs  accordingly  we have concluded that technological feasibility is not established until the completion of a working model 
the time period during which costs can be capitalized  from the point of reaching technological feasibility until the time of general product release  is very short and  consequently  the amounts that can be capitalized are not material to our financial position or results of operations 
therefore  we have charged all such costs to research and development in the period incurred 
restructuring expenses in calculating our restructuring expenses  we made several material estimates to determine the value of certain charges 
for example  we estimated the vacancy period and sublease income rate for our facility related charges 
our estimates were developed with input from real estate professionals familiar with current market conditions of the restructured facilities 
however  if real estate market conditions changed unexpectedly  an adjustment to the charge would be necessary and this could effect our financial statements 
note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report contains a full description of our restructuring charges 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets as a result of our restructuring activities  we evaluated the realizability of our long lived assets including fixed assets related to our restructured facility leases and intangible assets consisting primarily of unamortized goodwill 
we determined that million of leasehold improvements and million of furniture  fixtures and equipment were impaired as a result of these restructured operating leases 
in addition we determined that approximately million of purchased software was impaired due to our revised product development strategy 
lastly we wrote off the remaining unamortized goodwill totaling approximately million associated with two professional service acquisitions completed in fiscal year accounting for income taxes we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset to the extent management believes it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
as of december   we have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of their realizability

services revenues as a percentage of total revenues for the years ended december    and were  and  respectively 
we expect this percentage to remain constant at about in cost of product license revenues cost of product license revenues increased to million in from million in this increase primarily related to increased compensation and benefit costs associated with sustaining engineering activities 
in february  we settled a lawsuit filed by broadvision in december  which alleged that we were infringing on a patent for a method of conducting e commerce 
as part of the settlement  we agreed to pay broadvision a total of million in license fees  which are being accounted for as cost of product license revenues 
for  approximately half of our cost of product license revenues related to the broadvision settlement 
we will pay broadvision an additional  per quarter through the fourth quarter of cost of product license revenues decreased to million in from million in for the year ended december   approximately million related to the broadvision settlement  which was included in cost of product license revenues

to date  all software development costs have been expensed as research and development in the period incurred 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to the research and development expenses associated with our atg dynamo products and our atg portals server which we began shipping in the third quarter of approximately of the increase was attributable to compensation and benefits

based on cost reduction initiatives  we anticipate that research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues will decline in sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel  travel  public relations and marketing materials and events 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in approximately half of the increase was due to increased compensation and benefit costs  and the remaining of the increase was related to increased facilities and other allocated fixed costs such as rent  depreciation and telecommunication

for  and  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were  and  respectively 
due to cost reduction initiatives we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of total revenues in stock based compensation since the fourth quarter of  we have recorded total deferred stock based compensation of million in connection with stock option grants 
these amounts represent the difference between the exercise price of certain stock option grants and the deemed fair value for accounting purposes of our common stock at the time of these grants 
additionally  in july  we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million for unvested stock options acquired in connection with the acquisition of the toronto technology group  inc the number of these stock options has been reduced  due to the recipients of these grants terminating their employment with us 
we are amortizing these amounts over the vesting periods of the applicable options 
stock based compensation expense remained consistent at million in and we expect stock based compensation expense to decrease to approximately  in as a result of the restructuring that took place in stock based compensation expense increased to million in from million in this increase was due to the timing of our recording of stock based compensation and the options acquired in connection with the acquisition of the toronto technology group  inc restructuring expenses we undertook plans to restructure our operations during  as a result of a global slowdown in information technology spending

the net change in estimate was an additional charge of million in the fourth quarter 
of the million charge  a credit of million was realized due to the buy out of a lease in the second quarter 
we agreed to pay million ratably over years in relation to the buyout 
this credit was offset by an increase of approximately million due to updated assumptions  as a result of a market analysis  in decreased sublease rates and increased vacancy periods for two leases provided for in the second quarter expense 
a component of the million facility related restructuring costs  relates to the write off of the abandoned net book value of leasehold improvements and fixed assets of million and million  respectively

at december   we had an accrued restructuring liability of million  of which million was long term 
the majority of the remaining liability is comprised of facility related costs

these proceeds were invested primarily in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
additionally  the positive cash flow from operations also contributed to the increase in interest income 
interest expense decreased to zero in from  in the decrease was related to the repayment of outstanding indebtedness in with the proceeds from our initial public offering 
provision for income taxes we incurred net operating losses for four quarters in due to the uncertainty surrounding the utilization of our net deferred tax assets  net operating losses and research credits carryforwards  we have recorded a valuation allowance 
the provision recorded for the year ended december  represents this valuation allowance and foreign taxes attributable to our foreign sales affiliates 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements relate primarily to facilities  employee infrastructure and working capital requirements

borrowings bore interest at the bank s prime rate  at december  the revolving line of credit was collateralized by substantially all our assets

the revolving line of credit expired in december we are currently in negotiations for a new million covenant based revolving line of credit 
in september  we entered into a non recourse receivables purchase agreement with a bank  under which we could sell up to million of our accounts receivable to the bank 
under the terms of the receivables purchase agreement  we sold certain accounts receivable  subject to acceptance by the bank  on a non recourse basis 
upon purchase  the bank assumed the risk of collection for the acquired accounts receivable except in the event we violated the terms of the receivables purchase agreement or the customer asserted a discount  allowance  warranty claim or right of return

contractual obligations at december   our contractual cash obligations were as follows in thousands payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years lease commitments      broadvision settlement   we believe that our existing financial resources  together with cash generated by our operations  will be able to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  our actual cash requirements will depend on many factors  including particularly overall economic conditions both domestically and abroad 
we may seek additional external funds through public or private securities offerings  strategic alliances or other financing sources 
there can be no assurance that if we seek external funding  it will be available on favorable terms  if at all
