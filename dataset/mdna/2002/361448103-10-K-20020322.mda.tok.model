gatx financial corporation gfc  a wholly owned subsidiary of gatx corporation  has revolving credit facilities totaling million  consisting of a day agreement for million expiring in june  which gfc intends to renew  and two other agreements for million and million that will expire in and  respectively 
the revolving credit facilities contain various restrictive covenants  including an asset coverage test  requirements to maintain a defined minimum net worth and a certain fixed charges coverage ratio 
at december   gfc was in compliance with the covenants and conditions of the credit facilities 
as defined in the credit facilities  the net worth of gfc at december  was billion  which was in excess of the minimum net worth requirement of million 
additionally  the ratio of earnings to fixed charges as defined by the credit facilities was x for the december  period  which was in excess of the x requirement 
pursuant to the terms of the commercial paper programs and rating agency guidelines  gfc must maintain unused revolving credit capacity at least equal to the amount of commercial paper outstanding 
at december   gfc had available unused committed lines of credit amounting to million 
secured financings are comprised primarily of the sale leaseback of railcars 
other secured borrowings include mortgages on railcars and aircraft 
the railcar sale leasebacks qualify as operating leases and as such assets or liabilities associated with this equipment are not recorded on the balance sheet 
certain sale leasebacks involve railcars that are operated by special purpose entities spe that are wholly owned by gfc 
the railcars are owned by various financial institutions and leased to the spe 
these financial institutions also have a security interest in the underlying customer subleases on these railcars 
gfc manages the railcars for the spe  and the lease obligations are non recourse to gfc 
the spe structure was used in order to secure a higher credit rating and a lower cost of borrowing for gfc 
gfc has a billion shelf registration for debt securities  of which million has been issued 
the availability of these funding options may be adversely impacted by certain factors 
access to capital markets at competitive borrowing rates is dependent on gfc s credit rating as determined by rating agencies such as standard poor s s p and moody s investors service moody s 
on march   moody s downgraded gfc s long term unsecured debt to baa from baa and gfc s commercial paper to prime from prime moody s now maintains a stable outlook on gfc s ratings 
on march   s p downgraded gfc s long term unsecured debt from bbb to bbb and gfc s commercial paper from a to a s p also placed gfc s long term unsecured debt on credit watch with negative implications 
both rating agencies had maintained a negative outlook on the credit ratings of gfc due to the uncertainty surrounding the performance of gfc s aircraft portfolio resulting from the events of september  this negative outlook had increased the cost of borrowing in the financial markets for gfc 
due to these rating agency downgrades  gfc s access to the commercial paper market is likely to be seriously constrained or eliminated and gfc could have more difficulty accessing the long term capital market on a cost efficient basis 
a continued weak economic environment could decrease demand for gatx s services  which could impact the company s ability to generate cash flow from operations and portfolio proceeds 
subsequent to december   gatx completed a convertible debt transaction and a secured debt transaction that provided approximately million in net proceeds to gfc s liquidity position 
in addition  through mid march  gfc has received approximately million in secured aircraft financing proceeds from two aircraft warehouse financing facilities and gfc s european credit agency eca financing program 
the eca program was arranged to finance gfc s airbus a aircraft deliveries 
on march   gfc received initial approval from the export import bank of the united states ex im bank to provide credit support to finance gfc s boeing aircraft deliveries 
the ex im bank board of directors approved the transaction for referral to congress on march  and gfc expects final approval to be received by late april 
gfc believes that the combination of its current cash position  the ongoing proceeds from the aircraft warehouse facility  and the eca and ex im financings will enable it to meet its contractual obligations for without the further issuance of debt or a sustained drawdown of its committed bank lines 
at december   gatx s contractual commitments were in millions payments due by period years december total thereafter long term debt    capital lease obligations operating leases recourse   operating leases nonrecourse unconditional purchase obligations  other gatx has commitments of million for firm orders and options for new aircraft to be delivered between and other unconditional purchase obligations include million of specialty finance primarily related to business jet aircraft and marine equipment purchases and million related to new venture transactions generated in the ordinary course of business 
commitments to purchase railcars total million 
additionally  under the terms of the dec acquisition agreement gatx is obligated to invest million in dec over the next five years 
at december   gatx s unconditional purchase obligations by segment and business unit were in millions payments due by period years december total thereafter gatx rail financial services air specialty finance technology venture finance total financial services  gatx has various commercial commitments  such as guarantees and standby letters of credit  that could potentially require performance in the event of demands by third parties 
similar to gatx s on balance sheet investments  these guarantees expose gatx to credit and market risk  accordingly  gatx evaluates commitments and other contingent obligations using the same techniques used to evaluate funded transactions 
guarantees are commitments issued to guarantee performance of an affiliate to a third party  generally in the form of lease and loan payment guarantees  or to guarantee the value of an asset at the end of a lease 
lease and loan payment guarantees generally involve guaranteeing repayment of the financing utilized to acquire assets being leased by an affiliate to third parties  and are in lieu of making direct equity investments in the affiliate 
gatx is not aware of any event of default which would require it to satisfy these guarantees  and expects the affiliates to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy their lease and loan obligations 
asset residual value guarantees represent gatx s commitment to third parties that an asset or group of assets will be worth a specified amount at the end of a lease term 
over of the asset residual value guarantees are related to rail equipment 
based on known and expected market conditions  management does not believe that the asset residual value guarantees will result in any adverse financial impact to gatx 
gatx and its subsidiaries are also parties to letters of credit and bonds 
historically  no material claims have been made against these obligations 
management does not expect any material losses to result from these off balance sheet instruments because performance is not expected to be required  and therefore  is of the opinion that the fair value of these instruments is zero 
gatx s commercial commitments were in millions amount of commitment expiration per period years december total thereafter standby letters of credit and bonds 
affiliate debt recourse to gatx 
residual value guarantees rental guarantee at december   million of subsidiary net assets were restricted  limiting the ability of the subsidiaries to transfer assets to gatx in the form of loans  advances or dividends 
the majority of net asset restrictions relate to the revolving credit agreements and various loan agreements of gfc 
such restrictions are not expected to have an adverse impact on the ability of gatx to meet its cash obligations 
other information on september   terrorists highjacked and crashed four commercial aircraft resulting in a significant loss of life and a substantial loss of property

subsequent to year end  gatx successfully placed six of the seven aircraft  the remaining aircraft represents less than of the net book value of the total air portfolio 
the remaining eight aircraft are being remarketed by the pembroke group pembroke  a dublin based aircraft lessor in which the company owns a equity interest 
these eight aircraft represent approximately of the net book value of pembroke s aircraft portfolio

the effects that these terrorist attacks  or related future events  including military or police activities in the united states or abroad  future terrorist activities or threats of such activities  political unrest and instability  riots and protests  could have on the us economy  global financial markets and our business cannot presently be determined with any accuracy 
the effects may include  among other things  a permanent decrease in demand for air travel  consolidation in the airline industry  lower utilization of new and existing aircraft  lower aircraft rental rates  impairment of air portfolio assets and fewer available partners for joint ventures 
in the fourth quarter of  gatx and its joint ventures reviewed their air portfolio for impairment and recorded million in asset impairment charges 
depending upon the severity  scope and duration of these effects  the impact on gatx s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows could be material 
critical accounting policies operating lease assets and facilities operating lease assets and facilities are stated principally at cost 
assets acquired under capital leases are included in operating lease assets and the related obligations are recorded as liabilities 
provisions for depreciation include the amortization of the cost of capital leases 
operating lease assets and facilities are depreciated using the straight line method to an estimated residual value 
railcars  locomotives  aircraft  marine vessels  buildings and leasehold improvements are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
technology equipment is depreciated over the term of the lease contract 
impairment of long lived assets a review for impairment of long lived assets  such as operating lease assets and facilities  is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
allowance for possible losses the purpose of the allowance is to provide an estimate of possible credit losses inherent in the investment portfolio 
gatx sets the allowance by assessing overall risk and total probable losses in the portfolio and by reviewing gatx s historical loss experience 
gatx charges off amounts that management considers unrecoverable from obligors or through the disposition of collateral 
gatx assesses the recoverability of investments by considering factors such as a customer s payment history and financial position  and the value of collateral based on internal and external appraisal sources 
the allowance for possible losses is periodically reviewed for adequacy considering changes in economic conditions  collateral values and credit quality indicators 
gatx believes that the allowance is adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio as of december  because the allowance is based on judgments and estimates  it is possible that those judgments and estimates could change in the future  causing a corresponding change in the recorded allowance 
investments in affiliated companies investments in affiliated companies represent investments in domestic and foreign companies and joint ventures that are in businesses similar to those of gatx  such as aircraft leasing  rail equipment leasing  technology equipment leasing and other business activities  including ventures that provide asset residual value guarantees 
investments in to percent owned companies and joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method and are shown as investments in affiliated companies 
certain investments in joint ventures that exceed ownership are not consolidated and are also accounted for using the equity method as gatx does not have effective or voting control of these legal entities 
the investments in affiliated companies are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted for gatx s share of the affiliate s undistributed earnings 
distributions  which include both dividends and the return of principal  reduce the carrying amount of the investment 
new accounting pronouncements effective january   gatx adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
 as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
the statement requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the qualified nature of the hedge  changes in fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss income 
the change in fair value of the ineffective portion of a hedge will be immediately recognized in earnings 
gatx frequently obtains stock and warrants from non public  venture capital backed companies in connection with its financing activities 
under previous accounting guidance  both the stock and warrants were generally accounted for as available for sale securities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  with changes in fair value recorded as unrealized gains or losses in other comprehensive loss income in the equity section of the balance sheet 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 as amended  these warrants will be accounted for as derivatives  with prospective changes in fair value recorded in current earnings 
stock will continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
apart from warrants  gatx uses interest rate swap agreements  treasury derivatives  currency swap agreements  and forward currency sale agreements  as hedges to manage its exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate risk on existing and anticipated transactions 
to qualify for hedge accounting under previous accounting guidance  the derivative instrument must be identified with and reduce the risk arising from a specific transaction 
interest income or expense on interest rate swaps and treasury derivatives was accrued and recorded as an adjustment to the interest income or expense related to the hedged item 
realized and unrealized gains on currency swaps and forwards were deferred and included in the measurement of the hedged investment over the term of the contract 
fair value changes arising from forward sale agreements were deferred in the investment section of the balance sheet and recognized as part of other comprehensive loss income in shareholders equity 
the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in million being recognized as expense in the consolidated statement of income and million of unrealized gain in other comprehensive loss income in the first quarter of in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment testing in accordance with the statements 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
gatx will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of application of the nonamortization provisions of the statement is expected to result in an increase in pre tax income from continuing operations of approximately million in during  gatx will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january   and has not yet determined what impact  if any  such review will have on the earnings and financial position of the company 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this statement supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
although the new rules retain many of the fundamental recognition and measurement provisions of sfas no 
 they modify the criteria required to classify an asset as held for sale 
sfas no 
will also supersede certain provisions of apb opinion with regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business and will require expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be separately reported in discontinued operations during the period in which the losses are incurred rather than as of the measurement date as presently required by apb 
gatx is currently assessing the impact  if any  of this statement on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk gatx  like most other companies  is exposed to certain market risks  including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage these risks  gatx  pursuant to established and authorized policies  enters into certain derivative transactions  principally interest rate swaps  treasury derivatives and currency swaps 
these instruments and other derivatives are entered into for hedging purposes only 
gatx does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
gatx s interest expense is affected by changes in interest rates as a result of its use of variable rate debt instruments  including commercial paper and other floating rate debt 
based on gatx s variable rate debt at december   if market rates were to increase hypothetically by of gatx s weighted average floating rate  after tax interest expense would increase by approximately million in changes in certain currency exchange rates would also affect gatx s reported earnings 
based on reported earnings from continuing operations  a uniform and hypothetical strengthening in the us dollar versus applicable foreign currencies would decrease after tax income from continuing operations in by approximately million 
the interpretation and analysis of the results from the hypothetical changes to interest rates and currency exchange rates should not be considered in isolation  such changes would typically have corresponding offsetting effects 
for example  offsetting effects are present to the extent that floating rate debt is associated with floating rate assets
