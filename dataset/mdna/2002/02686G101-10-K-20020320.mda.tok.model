in february  the general partner instructed the servicer for the mortgage on water s edge of new jersey  a fully insured acquired construction loan  to file a notice of default and an election to assign the mortgage with hud 
the property underlying this construction loan was a nursing home located in trenton  new jersey 
as of january   the partnership had received approximately million of the assignment proceeds  including partial repayment of the outstanding principal and accrued interest 
hud had disallowed approximately million of the assignment claim 
the general partner retained counsel in this matter and pursued litigation against the loan servicer  greystone servicing corporation  inc greystone  for the amount disallowed by hud

for any loss greater than of the outstanding principal balance  the responsibility for paying the insurance benefits will be borne on a pro rata basis  by hud and by the coinsurance lender 
while the partnership is due payment of all amounts owed under the mortgage  the coinsurance lender is responsible for the timely payment of principal and interest to the partnership 
the coinsurance lender is prohibited from entering into any workout arrangement with the borrower without the partnership s consent and must file a claim for coinsurance benefits with hud  upon default  if the partnership so directs 
as an ongoing hud approved coinsurance lender  and under the terms of the participation documents  the coinsurance lender is required to satisfy certain minimum net worth requirements as set forth by hud 
however  it is possible that the coinsurance lender s potential liability for loss on these developments  and others  could exceed its hud required minimum net worth 
in such case  the partnership would bear the risk of loss if the coinsurance lenders were unable to meet their coinsurance obligations 
in addition  hud s obligation for the payment of its share of the loss could be diminished under certain conditions  such as the lender not adequately pursuing regulatory violations of the borrower or the failure to comply with other terms of the mortgage

the partnership s operating cash receipts  derived from payments of principal and interest on insured mortgages  plus cash receipts from interest on short term investments are the partnership s principal sources of cash flows and were sufficient during the years ended december   and to meet operating requirements 
the partnership anticipates its cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expense requirements for the basis for paying distributions to unitholders is net proceeds from mortgage dispositions  if any  and cash flow from operations  which includes regular interest income and principal from insured mortgages after paying all expenses of the partnership 
although the insured mortgages yield a fixed monthly mortgage payment once purchased  the cash distributions paid to the unitholders will vary during each quarter due to the fluctuating yields in the short term money market where the monthly mortgage payment receipts are temporarily invested prior to the payment of quarterly distributions  the reduction in the asset base  resulting from monthly mortgage payment receipts or mortgage dispositions  variations in the cash flow attributable to the delinquency or default of insured mortgages  and professional fees and foreclosure costs incurred in connection with those insured mortgages and variations in the partnership s operating expenses 
since the partnership is obligated to distribute the proceeds of mortgage prepayments  sales and insurance on insured mortgages as defined in the partnership agreement to its unitholders  the size of the partnership s portfolio will continue to decrease 
the magnitude of the decrease will depend upon the amount of the insured mortgages  which are prepaid  sold or assigned for insurance proceeds 
cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities decreased for as compared to this decrease is primarily due to the decrease in mortgage base 
the change in accounts payable and accrued expenses is primarily due to the payment of legal expenses related to the water s edge of new jersey litigation  as discussed previously 
net cash provided by investing activities increased for as compared to this increase is primarily due to proceeds received from patrician for the disposition of the delinquent mortgage on st 
charles place phase ii  proceeds received from greystone as a result of the settlement of water s edge of new jersey litigation  and an increase in the receipt of proceeds from mortgage dispositions 
these increases were slightly offset by a decrease in scheduled principal payments as a result of the reduction in mortgage base
