per bac for all years prior to the date of the merger 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company was formed on june  under the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act for the purpose of acquiring  holding  operating  selling and otherwise dealing primarily with multifamily residential properties  including the acquisition of debt and equity securities of entities engaged in similar activities 
the company began operations on december   when it merged with cap source i and cap source ii with the company being the surviving entity 
the company s business objectives are to i provide increased cash distributions to investors  ii provide a potential for an increase in net asset value  and iii provide enhanced liquidity and market value of its units 
management s strategy to meet these objectives includes acquiring investments in multifamily residential properties and acquiring securities of other entities engaged in similar real estate business 
results of operations the company s operating results depend primarily on income from its multifamily properties  which is substantially influenced by supply of and demand for apartment units  operating expense levels and property level operations 
the multifamily real estate industry is experiencing soft market conditions in most markets nationwide  including those in which certain of the company s properties operate 
these conditions are attributable to a general deterioration of economic conditions  more market competition  and competition from single family homes 
as a result of the above  the company s properties are experiencing what management anticipates to be a short term decline in the physical and economic occupancy levels of its properties 
at december   the average physical occupancy of the company s properties was  compared to at december  for the year ended december   the average economic occupancy of the company s properties was  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the average economic occupancy of the properties was primarily noted in the fourth quarter and is primarily attributable to the use of rental concessions to maintain physical occupancy levels 
in addition  property operating expenses such as utilities  insurance and property taxes continue to increase 
utility expenses have increased due to rate increases  property taxes have increased due to rate and assessed value increases in certain jurisdictions where the properties are located and insurance expenses have increased due to rate increases by insurance carriers 
these expenses are fixed costs to an extent but are still actively managed 
in response to these conditions  management continues to actively manage each property to maximize the net operating income from each 
this includes the employment of innovative on site marketing techniques with a strong focus on resident retention and the negotiation and management of operating expenses 
as a result  management believes the properties will continue to perform at reasonable levels during these conditions and will be well situated for growth when the conditions turn more favorable 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding the company s real estate investments as of december

critical accounting policies the company considers its critical accounting policies to be the accounting for its investment in operating partnerships and the valuation of its investments in real estate assets 
the investment in operating partnerships consists of interests in limited partnerships which own multifamily residential properties 
the investments in operating partnerships are accounted for using the equity method as the company has significant influence  but not control over the operating partnerships 
as such  the company records its proportionate share of the operating partnerships income or losses 
the investments in the operating partnerships were recorded at the cost to acquire such interests 
the company suspends recognizing losses in the operating partnerships when its entire investment becomes consumed by such losses 
losses are then recognized only to the extent of additional contributions  net of distributions received  to the operating partnerships by the company 
cash distributions received from operating partnerships whose entire investment has been reduced to zero through the recognition of proportionate losses are recognized as income when received by the company 
the company is not the general partner of the operating partnerships and does not have a legal obligation to provide additional cash support  nor has it indicated any commitment to provide this support  accordingly  the investment in such operating partnerships has not been reduced below zero 
cash distributions received from operating partnerships whose entire investment has not been reduced to zero through the recognition of proportionate losses is recorded as a reduction of the company s investment in the respective operating partnership 
such operating partnerships include the former capital source ii assets  which were recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of the merger  and operating partnerships in which the company has made additional equity investments 
the gnma certificates owned by the company are guaranteed as to principal and interest by gnma and are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government 
the operating partnerships  however  are not insured or guaranteed 
the value of these investments is a function of the value of the real estate owned by the operating partnerships and the amount of cash distributions received from the operating partnerships is a function of the net rental revenue generated by the properties owned by the operating partnerships 
it is the policy of the company to make a periodic review of the estimated fair value of the properties underlying the operating partnerships 
the review of recoverability is based upon comparing the net book value of each real estate property to its estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value is determined based upon the estimated future cash flows of each property  discounted at an estimated capitalization rate 
the calculation of discounted estimated future cash flows includes certain variables such as the assumed inflation rates for rents and expenses  capitalization rates and discount rates 
in certain cases  additional factors such as the replacement value of the property or comparable sales of similar properties are also taken into consideration 
each real estate property is recorded at the lower of the company s cost or fair value 
management reviews each property for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable 
the review of recoverability is based upon comparing the net book value of each real estate property to its estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value is determined based upon the estimated future cash flows of each property  discounted at an estimated capitalization rate 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the property exceeds its estimated fair value 
the recognition of an impaired investment in an operating partnership or property and the potential impairment calculation are subject to a considerable degree of judgment  the results of which when applied under different conditions or assumptions could have a material impact on the financial statements 
the estimated future cash flow of each property is subject to a significant amount of uncertainty in the estimation of future rental receipts  future rental expenses  and future capital expenditures 
such estimates are affected by economic factors such as the rental markets and labor markets in which the properties operate and tax and insurance expenses 
different conditions or different assumptions applied to the calculation would likely result in materially different amounts 
the company does periodically compare the results of its estimates with historical results to evaluate the reasonableness and accuracy of its estimates and adjust its estimates accordingly 
the company did not incur any impairment losses in the years ended december   or depreciation of real estate is based on the estimated useful life of the property  generally years  using the straight line method 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
capital improvements and significant betterment projects exceeding  per project are capitalized and depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful life 
misapplication of the company s capitalization and depreciation policies may have a significant impact on the financial statements 
the company has designed preventive and detective controls for adherence to such policies 
however  in the event of a control departure  materially different amounts may be reported 
the tables below compare the results of operations for each year shown

in accordance with the purchase method of accounting  the results of operations for the years ended december  and up until the date of the merger  december   are that of the predecessor cap source i only  and are therefore not comparable with the company s results of operations for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to the year ended december  mortgage backed securities income increased  from to as a result of the merger 
slightly offsetting this increase are decreases due to the payoff of three mortgage backed securities in and the continued amortization of the principal balances of the mortgage backed securities 
interest income on cash and cash equivalents decreased  from to due to a decrease in the average balance of such investments and the decrease in rates earned thereon 
the decrease in the average balance is attributable to the purchase of corporate equity securities  acquisitions of real estate properties and the payment of distributions in accordance with the settlement 
the company earned dividend income of  on its investment in corporate equity securities which were acquired in the predecessor did not own corporate equity securities in and accordingly did not earn dividend income in the company earned rental income of  which is attributable to the acquisitions of brentwood oaks apartments in august and huntsview apartments in december 
the predecessor did not directly own any properties in and accordingly did not earn rental income in equity in the earnings of operating partnerships increased  from to this increase is primarily due to the effects of the merger 
in addition  during  the company received distributions totaling  from fox hollow apartments  highland park apartments  water s edge apartments  and bluff ridge apartments  compared to when the predecessor received distributions totaling  from the ponds at georgetown  highland park apartments and water s edge apartments 
such cash distributions from operating partnerships are recorded as income when received because the company s financial statement balance of these operating partnerships has been reduced to zero through the recognition of proportionate losses in excess of the company s investment 
these increases in cash distributions from the operating partnerships are due to increases in the net cash flows generated by the underlying properties 
the company incurred real estate operating expenses of  and depreciation expense of  in  which are attributable to the acquisitions of brentwood oaks apartments in august and huntsview apartments in december 
the predecessor did not directly own any properties in and  accordingly  did not incur real estate operating expenses or depreciation expense in the company incurred interest expense of  in on its i bonds and mortgage payable  ii notes payable originated in connection with the merger  and iii repurchase obligations 
the predecessor did not have borrowings and  accordingly  did not recognize interest expense during operating and administrative expenses increased  from to in  the company recorded  of legal fees incurred in connection with the settlement 
excluding such expense  operating and administrative fees increased  which is attributable to increases of i  in salaries and related expenses due to the merger  ii  in administrative fees due to the merger  and iii  in the company s other general and administrative expenses due to the merger 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  mortgage backed securities income decreased by  from to such decrease was attributable to the continued amortization of the principal balances of the mortgage backed securities 
interest income on cash and cash equivalents increased  from to due to an increase in the average interest rate earned on cash investments 
during  distributions totaling  were received from the ponds at georgetown  highland park apartments and water s edge apartments compared to  received from the water s edge apartments in no additional contributions were made to any operating partnerships during  while additional contributions totaling  were made to waterman s crossing  misty springs apartments and fox hollow apartments during equity in earnings of the operating partnerships for was recorded to the extent of distributions received from the operating partnerships  net of additional investments 
likewise  equity in losses of operating partnerships for was recorded to the extent of additional contributions to operating partnerships  net of distributions received 
accordingly  equity in earnings of operating partnerships increased  from to these increases in cash distributions from the operating partnerships are due to increases in the net cash flows generated by the underlying properties 
operating and administrative expenses increased  from to excluding the effects of the  of legal fees incurred in connection with the settlement  operating and administrative expenses increased  from to such increase resulted from i an increase of approximately  in salaries and related expenses  ii an increase in legal fees of approximately  partially offset by iii a net decrease of approximately  in other operating and administrative expenses 
funds from operations the company considers funds from operations ffo to be a key measure of its performance and should be considered along with  but not as an alternative to  net income and cash flow as a measure of the company s operating performance and liquidity 
ffo was  for the year ended december  the white paper on ffo approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit in october defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred financing cost and after comparable adjustments for an entity s portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities and joint ventures 
the company computes ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other entities that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net income as an indication of the company s financial performance or to gaap cash flow from operating activities as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
ffo may include funds that may not be available for management s discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures and property acquisitions  and other commitments and uncertainties 
liquidity and capital resources cash generated by the operating partnerships and the two multifamily residential properties is a function of the net cash flow of the underlying property 
the amount of cash received by the company from the real estate is a function of the net rental revenues generated by the properties 
net rental revenues from a multifamily apartment complex depend on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and on the level of operating expenses 
occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of  and demand for  apartments in the market areas in which a property is located 
this  in turn  is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions  the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single family mortgage loans 
in addition  factors such as government regulation such as zoning laws  inflation  real estate and other taxes  labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a property 
the company believes that cash provided by its real estate investments and investment income from its gnmas and other investments  supplemented  if necessary  by cash on hand  will be adequate to meet its projected short term and long term liquidity requirements 
the company s strategy includes the acquisition of additional multifamily residential properties as well as debt and equity securities of entities engaged in similar activities 
in addition  the company intends to actively manage the makeup of its real estate portfolio 
the company s investment strategy will be funded from available cash and short term investments and from i borrowing against or sale of the existing properties  ii borrowing against or sale of the gnma certificates  and iii borrowing against the additional properties acquired by the company 
the company may also use additional sources of financing  both debt and equity  to further its business objectives and investment strategies 
the company s primary uses of cash are i the payment of distributions to unit holders  ii debt service  iii payment of operating expenses  and iv the acquisition of additional real estate investments 
the following table sets forth information regarding cash distributions paid to unit holders during the years shown 
imagegif 
per bac of the predecessor for years prior to the date of the merger 
in addition  in the company also made special distributions to note holders in conjunction with the settlement and merger 
the special distributions to note holders in january and april were and per note  respectively 
future distributions to unit holders will depend on the amount of net rental income and interest income earned by the company and the amount of undistributed cash 
on january   the company announced an increase in its annual regular distribution to 
per unit effective with the first quarter distribution payable on april  new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial accounting standards fas no 
 business combinations and fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets which provide guidance on how entities are to account for business combinations and for the goodwill and other intangible assets that arise from those combinations or are acquired otherwise 
these standards are effective for the company on january  fas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
as of the date of adoption  the company had unamortized goodwill of approximately  amortization expense related to such goodwill was approximately  for the year ended december  management does not believe the impact of adoption of the new pronouncements will have a significant effect on the financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued fas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  which provides guidance on the accounting of long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of and the reporting of discontinued operations 
the adoption of this standard  which is effective for the company on january   is not expected to have a significant impact on the financial statements of the company 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements that reflect management s current beliefs and estimates of future economic circumstances  industry conditions  the company s performance and financial results 
all statements  trend analysis and other information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations of the company and the real estate investments it has made including  but not limited to  the information contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  constitute forward looking statements 
unit holders and others should understand that these forward looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  and a number of factors could affect the future results of the company and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements contained herein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its long and short term borrowings used to fund expansion of the company s real estate portfolio and its variable rate notes payable issued in connection with the merger 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate caps  in order to mitigate its interest rate risk 
the company does not enter into derivative instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the company s control 
the potential for significant volatility in the interest rate markets was especially displayed during  when the federal reserve board decreased the federal funds rate eleven times 
at december   approximately of the company s borrowings consisted of fixed rate financing 
the remaining consisted of variable rate financing 
variations in interest rates affect the company s cost of borrowing on its variable rate financing 
the interest rates payable by the company on these obligations increase or decrease with certain index interest rates 
if the company s borrowing costs increase  the amount of cash available for distribution to unit holders will decrease 
the following tables provide information at december  regarding the company s financial instruments sensitive to interest rate risk 
imagegif 
the aggregate fair value of the company s borrowings at december  was  as the above tables incorporate only those positions or exposures that existed as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
the company s ultimate economic impact with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  the company s risk mitigating strategies at that time and interest rates
