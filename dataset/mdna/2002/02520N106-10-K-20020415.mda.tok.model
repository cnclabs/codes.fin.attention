item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial conditions forward looking statements certain matters discussed and statements made within this form k are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private litigation reform act of and as such may involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company to be different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
although the company believes the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  it can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained 
these risks are detailed periodically in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission or other public statements 
general historically  the company s financial results have been affected significantly by the cyclical nature of the real estate industry 
accordingly  the company s historical financial statements may not be indicative of future results 
the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles through the company s accounting policies 
these policies may require the use of estimates 
the most critical policy used involves the allocation of land and development costs to the lots or parcels sold in any given period 
the cost of sales is determined by the relative sales value method which relies on estimated costs and sales values 
residential and commercial land sales can be highly cyclical 
once development is undertaken  no assurances can be given that the company will be able to sell the various developed lots in a timely manner 
failure to sell such lots in a timely manner could result in significantly increased carrying costs and erosion or elimination of profit with respect to any development 
even though our cost estimates are based on outside engineers cost estimates  historical cost and current actual development costs can exceed estimates for various reasons  including but not limited to unknown site conditions  rising prices and changes in government regulations 
any estimates of such costs may differ substantially from the actual results of such costs and reduce or eliminate the future profits with respect to any development
