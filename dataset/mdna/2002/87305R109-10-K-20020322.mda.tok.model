item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes  and the other financial information included in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in item  business factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this report 
overview we provide time critical  one stop manufacturing services for highly complex printed circuit boards 
our customers include original equipment manufacturers of electronic products and their suppliers  or electronic manufacturing services providers 
our time to market focused manufacturing services enable our customers to shorten the time required to develop new products and bring them to market 
we measure customers as those companies that placed at least two orders in the preceding month period 
as of december   we had approximately customers  compared to approximately customers at december  we added approximately new customers in sales to our top customers represented of our net sales in and of our net sales in our products are manufactured to our customers design specifications and are priced to reflect both the complexity of the printed circuit boards and the time and volume requirements for the order 
generally  we quote prices after we receive the design specifications and time and volume requirements from our customers 
purchase orders may be cancelled prior to shipment 
we charge customers a fee  based on percentage completed  if an order is cancelled once it has entered production 
we recognize revenues upon shipment to the customer 
we record net sales as our gross sales less an allowance for returns 
we provide our customers a limited right of return for defective printed circuit boards 
we record an allowance for estimated sales returns at the time of sale based on our historical results 
our provision for sales returns as a percentage of gross sales was less than in and cost of goods sold consists of materials  labor  outside services and overhead expenses incurred in the manufacture and testing of our products 
many factors affect our gross margin  including capacity utilization  product mix  production volume and yield 
we do not participate in any significant long term supply contracts  and we believe there are a number of potential suppliers for the raw materials we use 
we believe that our cost of goods sold will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
our operating expenses have historically been classified into five general categories selling and marketing  general and administrative  amortization of intangibles  amortization of deferred retention bonus and management fees 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions paid to our internal sales force and commissions paid to independent sales representatives  as well as costs associated with marketing materials and trade shows 
as quickturn sales become a higher percentage of total sales  our average commission rate is expected to increase 
we expect our selling and marketing expenses to continue to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
general and administrative costs primarily include the salaries for executive  finance  accounting  facilities and human resources personnel  as well as insurance expenses and expenses for accounting and legal assistance 
we expect these expenses to continue to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales as we add personnel and incur additional costs related to the growth of our business and the requirements of operating as a public company 
amortization of intangibles consists of the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets which we recorded as a result of the power circuits acquisition in july amortization of the deferred retention bonus relates to a retention bonus plan we implemented as part of our leveraged recapitalization in december in  we paid out million to participants in order to eliminate our obligations under this plan 
in  we paid management fees for advisory services to three firms  tc management  tc management iv and brockway moran partners management 
these firms indirectly control our principal shareholder  circuit holdings  inc in consideration for advisory and management services rendered to us  we paid these firms an aggregate fee of million upon consummation of our september initial public offering  which was accounted for as an offering cost 
in addition  we used approximately million of the net proceeds we received from our initial public offering to amend and consolidate these management agreements 
under the amended agreement  we no longer pay monthly management fees  however  we will pay financial advisory fees of of the first million of proceeds or value of any transaction with respect to which these entities render services and of any amount of proceeds or value in excess of million 
accordingly  we paid a financial advisory fee of  in connection with our public offering in february  which will be accounted for as an offering cost 
our interest expense relates to our senior credit facility and our other long term obligations 
primarily as a result of our repayment of indebtedness  our interest expense has decreased significantly in recent periods 
amortization of debt issuance costs consists of the amortization of loan origination fees and related expenses 
as a result of our repayment of indebtedness and the refinancing of our senior credit facility see liquidity and capital resources in september  we wrote off a significant portion of our debt issuance costs as an extraordinary item  and amortization of debt issuance costs has decreased 
interest and other income consists of interest received on cash balances as well as lease revenue received for subleasing some of our space in santa ana  california  to an unaffiliated tenant through march prior to  we received significant interest income due to a large cash position invested in treasury securities 
prior to our leveraged recapitalization in december  we were taxed for federal income tax purposes as an s corporation 
accordingly  we had no income tax expense prior to december  at the time of our recapitalization  we became a c corporation and the tax effect of all differences between the tax reporting and financial reporting bases of our net assets was recorded as a net deferred tax asset 
the most significant basis difference resulted from an internal revenue code section h tax election we made at the time of recapitalization 
this election had the effect of characterizing the recapitalization and stock purchase as an asset purchase for income tax purposes 
therefore  the consideration paid to our former owners  either by us or by circuit holdings  in excess of the tax basis of our net assets was recorded as tax deductible goodwill of million  even though no goodwill was recorded for financial reporting purposes 
to the extent that we have future taxable income  we will realize the benefit of this tax goodwill over years 
this results in an annual deduction of million which  assuming an effective income tax rate of  could reduce our cash taxes payable each year by million 
from time to time we estimate whether we will be able to earn enough taxable income over the life of the deferred tax asset to fully realize the benefit of the asset 
at the time of our recapitalization  we concluded that we were unlikely to fully realize its benefit and  accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance against the asset 
at december   we reassessed the realizability of our deferred tax assets and concluded  based upon our tax net operating loss of million  among other factors  that the valuation allowance was still necessary 
at december   we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million and a valuation allowance of million 
upon the completion of our initial public offering  we reevaluated the realizability of our deferred tax asset 
in  we eliminated the million valuation allowance and recorded this as an income tax benefit 
our decision was based upon the anticipated significant reduction in interest expense and increases in operating income for the quarters after our initial public offering 
as of december   we had net tax deferred assets of approximately million and no valuation allowance 
should our expectations of taxable income change in future years  it may become necessary to record a valuation allowance which would adversely affect our results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth income statement data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangibles amortization of deferred retention bonus management fees total operating expenses operating income interest expense amortization of debt issuance costs interest income and other  net income before income taxes and extraordinary items income tax provision benefit income before extraordinary items extraordinary items  net of taxes net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease resulted primarily from a decline in the volume of printed circuit boards sold 
net sales declined due to a significant downturn in the electronics industry and the end markets we serve 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold decreased million  or  from million in to million in lower cost of goods sold resulted from a decline in the number of printed circuit boards sold  combined with a work force reduction and decreased employee overtime  partially offset by higher depreciation expense 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold increased from in to in the reduced revenue base caused an increase in unabsorbed manufacturing overhead  resulting in higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease in gross profit resulted from a lower volume of printed circuit boards sold 
our gross margin was during  compared to for gross margin decreased due to lower absorption of fixed manufacturing expenses 
operating expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease resulted from lower commissions due to lower net sales in general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease resulted from a lower bad debt provision  reduced incentive compensation  a decline in office rent expense and lower legal and accounting fees 
the lower bad debt provision was due to a smaller accounts receivable balance and an improved aging of accounts receivable in amortization of intangibles consists of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets from the power circuits acquisition  which occurred in july amortization of intangibles was million for both and as more fully described in recently issued accounting standards below  we will not amortize goodwill in or future periods 
with the proceeds of our initial public offering in september  we bought out our deferred retention bonus plan 
therefore  we recorded no amortization of the deferred retention bonus in as compared to million for in conjunction with our initial public offering in september  we amended and consolidated our management agreements with tc management  tc management iv and brockway moran partners management 
under the amended agreement  we are not required to pay management and consulting fees  although we are required to pay financial advisory fees in the event of certain transactions as defined in the amended agreement 
we had no management fees and related expenses in  compared to million in interest expense 
interest expense decreased million from million in to million in this decrease resulted primarily from our repayment of indebtedness with the proceeds of our initial public offering and cash flow from operations 
this repayment significantly reduced our debt and decreased our accompanying level of interest expense 
amortization of debt issuance costs 
amortization of debt issuance costs decreased  from  in to  in as a result of our repayment of indebtedness and the refinancing of our senior credit facility in september  we wrote off a significant portion of our debt issuance costs 
interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net  which includes rental income  increased  from  in to  in this change was due primarily to increased interest income earned on our higher average cash balance during  partially offset by a decrease in net rental income 
net rental income decreased from  for to a net expense of  for due to the termination of a sublease to allow for the expansion of our santa ana  california  facility 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased from a net benefit of million in to an expense of million in the net benefit of million in was due to higher pretax income offset by a one time million benefit recorded from eliminating our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
our effective tax rate for was 
extraordinary items 
in  we recorded a loss of million  net of a tax benefit of million  to extinguish subordinated debt obligations carried at a discount and to write off debt issuance costs related to repayments and refinancing of our senior credit facility 
we recorded no extraordinary items in year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased million  or  from million in to million in of this increase  approximately million resulted from our acquisition of power circuits  as a full year of net sales were included in approximately million of the net sales increase resulted from internal sales growth 
internal sales growth increased primarily due to higher levels of units shipped and higher price levels in response to increasing demand from new and existing customers 
in addition  a favorable sales mix  including a higher proportion of quick turn and advanced technology printed circuit boards  which have higher average selling prices  contributed to higher net sales in sales in our networking and high end computing end markets increased in compared with as a result of strong demand in those segments 
cost of goods sold 
costs of goods sold increased million  or  from million in to million in higher costs of goods sold resulted from our acquisition of power circuits  which contributed million to the increase 
the remaining million increase in costs was due to our increase in net sales as well as higher per unit costs associated with producing quick turn products and higher layer count printed circuit boards 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in of this increase  million resulted from the acquisition of power circuits 
the remaining increase of million resulted from an improved mix of higher margin quick turn and advanced technology printed circuit boards  higher capacity utilization and generally higher unit volumes and pricing levels for all of our products 
gross margin increased from in to in primarily due to an improved mix of higher margin products 
operating expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in of this increase  million resulted from the acquisition of power circuits 
the remaining increase of million resulted from an increase in commissions related to higher sales volume 
selling and marketing expenses increased as a percentage of net sales from in to in primarily due to quick turn sales  for which we pay a higher commission rate 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in of this increase  million resulted from the acquisition of power circuits 
the remaining increase of million resulted from an increase in bad debt and incentive bonus expenses  the hiring of additional financial management and back office staff to support our growth  and increased costs associated with being a public company 
amortization of intangibles increased million  or  from million in to million in  due to the acquisition of power circuits in july we recorded a full year of amortization of intangibles in versus approximately months in amortization of deferred retention bonus increased million from million in to million in  due to the vesting and buy out of our deferred retention bonus plan 
management fees and related expenses increased million from  in to million in of this increase  million resulted from a one time payment to amend and consolidate our management agreements with tc management  tc management iv and brockway moran partners management 
the remaining increase resulted from additional management fees related to greater scope and services in due to the acquisition of power circuits as well as reimbursable expenses under the agreements 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase resulted from a higher level of indebtedness and higher interest rates through the first three quarters of associated with the acquisition of power circuits 
interest expense decreased significantly in the last quarter of due to lower interest rates and reduced debt levels resulting from the pay down of debt with the net proceeds of our initial public offering 
amortization of debt issuance costs 
amortization of debt issuance costs decreased  or  from  in to  in amortization of debt issuance costs increased through the first three quarters of as a result of higher levels of indebtedness associated with the acquisition of power circuits 
these costs decreased in the fourth quarter of due to the restructuring of our credit facilities after our initial public offering 
as a result of our repayment of indebtedness and the refinancing of our senior credit facility see liquidity and capital resources in september  we wrote off a significant portion of our debt issuance costs as an extraordinary item 
interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net  increased  or  from  in to  in  due to interest earned on our cash balances as well as additional income from a sublease that we obtained as a result of the acquisition of power circuits 
we terminated a portion of the sublease in the second quarter of to accommodate our then planned santa ana facility expansion 
income taxes 
our provision for income taxes decreased from an expense of  in to a benefit of million in this decrease resulted primarily from a million benefit recorded in from eliminating our deferred tax asset valuation allowance  which was only partially offset by higher taxes associated with increased pretax net income levels 
extraordinary items 
we recorded extraordinary items in both and both extraordinary items were for losses on early extinguishment of debts  net of the tax benefit 
in  we recorded a loss of million  net of a tax benefit of million  to extinguish subordinated debt obligations and eliminate our retention bonus obligation  both of which were carried at a discount  and to write off debt issuance costs related to repayments and refinancing of our senior credit facility 
in  we recorded a loss of million  net of a tax benefit of  to write off debt issuance costs as a result of new financing obtained in connection with the acquisition of power circuits 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations  proceeds from our initial public offering in september  our public offering in february and borrowings under debt agreements 
our principal uses of cash have been to finance mergers and acquisitions  meet debt service requirements and finance capital expenditures 
we anticipate that these uses will continue to be our principal uses of cash in the future 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million in the difference between our net income of million and our million operating cash flow was primarily attributable to a million decrease in accounts receivable  million of depreciation and amortization expense  a million decrease in inventories and a million decrease in the deferred income tax asset  partially offset by a million increase in income taxes receivable  a million decrease in accounts payable  a million decrease in income taxes payable and a million decrease in accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in this decrease was due to a lower level of purchases of and deposits on property and equipment 
the approximately million of capital expenditures in were primarily attributable to our quick turn expansion in santa ana and technology advancements in our redmond facility 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million in in  we repaid million of long term debt and bought out our deferred retention bonus program at million 
we used million in net proceeds from our initial public offering  refinanced our term debt at million  drew million on our revolving credit facility and used available cash to satisfy these obligations 
in contrast  no cash was generated from such financing activities as the sale of common stock or issuance of long term debt during the significant reduction of our long term debt in september greatly reduced our principal payments in effective september   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement and refinanced all remaining amounts outstanding under our existing senior credit facility 
under the new agreement  we borrowed million under a term loan 
the term loan bears interest ranging from libor plus to libor plus or the alternate base rate as defined in the agreement plus to the alternative base rate plus and is due in quarterly payments of various amounts through september  the agreement also provides for a revolving loan commitment for up to million  which bears interest at libor plus to libor plus or the alternate base rate plus to the alternative base rate plus and expires september  as of december   we had outstanding term loan borrowings of million and no borrowings on our revolving loan facility 
as of december   the term loan and the revolving loan had an interest rate of 
we pay quarterly a commitment fee ranging from to on the unused revolving commitment amount 
the credit facility contains financial covenants customary for this type of financing 
as of december   we were in compliance with these financial covenants 
the following table provides information on future payments under the company s credit facility and future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt    operating leases total contractual cash obligations    based on our current level of operations  we believe that cash generated from operations  available cash and amounts available under our senior credit facility will be adequate to meet the debt service requirements  capital expenditures and working capital needs of our current operations for at least the next months 
we may require additional financing if we decide to consummate additional acquisitions 
foreign currency exchange risk all of our sales are denominated in us dollars  and as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not dependent upon moderate changes in the inflation rate as we expect that we will be able to pass along component price increases to our customers 
seasonality we have experienced sales fluctuations due to patterns in the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our customers and the end markets they serve 
in particular  this effect is caused by the seasonality of the high end computing and computer peripherals end markets 
we expect to mitigate the impact of seasonality through diversification of our customer base 
significant accounting policies accounting policies where significant judgments and estimates are made include asset valuations related to bad debts  sales returns and allowances  impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  and realizability of deferred tax assets 
a description of these estimates and our policies to account for them is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our estimates are based on historical experience as well as relevant facts and circumstances known to us at each reporting date 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
statement no 
requires the recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and the measurement date of those instruments at fair value 
gains and losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
statement no 
 as amended  is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  based upon the nature of the financial instruments and our hedging activities  this pronouncement requires us to reflect the fair value of our derivative instruments interest rate swaps on our consolidated balance sheet 
changes in fair value of these derivatives are reflected as a component of comprehensive income 
we adopted statement no 
effective january  this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
as of december   we had no derivative instruments 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we will apply the new rules beginning in the first quarter of also during  we will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  we have not yet fully determined what the effect of these statements will be on our results of operations and financial position 
goodwill amortization for the year ended december  was approximately million 
in august  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application encouraged 
we do not believe the adoption of statement will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which replaces fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale applies to all long lived assets  including discontinued operations  and replaces the provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  for the disposal of segments of a business 
statement requires that those long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
therefore  discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred 
statement also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
the provisions of statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and  generally  are to be applied prospectively 
we do not believe the adoption of statement will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our senior credit facility bears interest at floating rates 
we have in the past reduced our exposure to interest rate risks through swap agreements 
however  at december   we had no outstanding swap agreements 
the outstanding balance due on our senior credit facility as of december   was million 
our credit facility also includes a million revolving loan  which bears interest ranging from to per annum plus the applicable libor or from to per annum plus the alternate base rate  as defined in the agreement governing the amended and restated credit facility 
therefore  a change in interest rates is not expected to materially affect the interest expense to be incurred on this facility during such period 
as of december   we had no outstanding balance due on our revolving loan
