item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis contains statements that are forward looking 
these statements are based upon current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors 
see the discussion in forward looking statements below 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
management uses its best judgment in the assumptions used to value these estimates  which are based on current facts and circumstances  prior experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
the company s accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and are the policies which are most critical in the portrayal of the company s financial position and results of operations long term contracts revenue on long term fixed price contracts is recognized using the efforts expended percentage of completion method of accounting 
this method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of costs to complete for contracts in progress 
in making such estimates  judgments are required to evaluate contingencies  such as potential variances in schedule and labor and other contract costs  liability claims  contract disputes or achievement of contractual performance standards 
changes in total estimated contract costs and losses  if any  are recognized in the period they are determined 
allowance for doubtful accounts allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes at june   the company had approximately million of deferred income tax benefits 
the realization of a portion of these benefits is dependent on the company s estimates of future taxable income and its tax planning strategies 
management believes that sufficient taxable income will be earned in the future to realize deferred income tax benefits  accordingly  no valuation allowance has been provided 
additionally  the realization of these deferred income tax benefits can be impacted by changes to tax codes  statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
business acquisitions assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
at june   the company had approximately million of goodwill  representing the cost of acquisitions in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired companies 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment testing 
the assessment of goodwill involves the estimation of the fair value of the company s reporting unit  as defined by sfas management completed this assessment during the second quarter of fiscal based on the best information available as of the date of assessment and determined that no impairment existed 
there can be no assurance that future events will not result in impairments of goodwill or other assets 
results of operations the company derives its revenue from fees for providing engineering and consulting services 
the types of contracts with our customers and the approximate percentage of net service revenue for the year ended june  from each contract type are as follows o time and material o fixed price or lump sum o cost type with various fee arrangements in the course of providing its services  the company routinely subcontracts drilling  laboratory analyses  construction equipment and other services 
these costs are passed directly through to customers and  in accordance with industry practice  are included in gross revenue 
because subcontractor costs and direct charges can vary significantly from project to project  the company considers net service revenue nsr  which is gross revenue less subcontractor costs and direct charges  as its primary measure of revenue growth 
the following table presents the percentage relationships of items in the consolidated statements of operations to net service revenue years ended june  net service revenue operating costs and expenses cost of services general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization income from operations interest expense income before taxes federal and state income tax provision net income dividends and accretion charges on preferred stock net income available to common shareholders compared to the revenue growth trend established in fiscal has continued for the fifth consecutive year 
gross revenue increased million  or  to an all time high of million in fiscal  from million in fiscal net service revenue increased million  or  to an all time high of million in fiscal  from million in fiscal these increases were due to a combination of internal growth arising out of increased demand for the company s services and the additional revenue from acquisitions made in fiscal and nsr from acquired companies is considered part of acquisition growth during the twelve months following the date acquired 
approximately of the nsr growth for fiscal was from acquisitions  while as discussed below  operating income growth for fiscal was greater from organic existing business activities 
these characteristics are due to o the relatively larger size of the two recently acquired companies  compared to the company s historically smaller size acquisitions 
o the seasonality of the largest acquisition site blauvelt  which added significant nsr with relatively small operating income during the winter period 
o increased margins provided by the company s organic business activities 
management s goal continues to be to provide a reasonable balance between organic and acquisition growth over a several year period 
for example  operating income growth over the last three years has averaged and  respectively  between organic and acquisition activities 
cost of services increased in fiscal due to the increase in net service revenue 
general and administrative expenses g a increased approximately in fiscal primarily from additional costs necessary to support the company s internal and acquisition growth 
however  as a percentage of nsr  g a expenses decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease is due to the company s ability to generate and manage the increased revenue without adding a proportional amount of overhead  resulting in higher margins for all services performed 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the company s early adoption of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets on july  in accordance with sfas  the company no longer amortizes goodwill 
the decrease associated with the adoption of sfas  was  however  partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense primarily associated with acquisitions completed in fiscal and income from operations increased approximately to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal additionally  the company s operating income margin increased to from during the same period 
approximately of the fiscal operating income growth increase was from organic activities 
the remaining of operating income growth was from acquisitions completed during the past twelve months 
the favorable organic growth percentages reflect the company s successful efforts to obtain higher margin revenue for its services 
the improvement in operating income performance was primarily due to o the company s focus toward higher margin  economically driven markets  o the growth in revenue  without comparable increases in overhead  and o the favorable impact resulting from the adoption of sfas interest expense decreased by approximately in fiscal primarily due to lower average interest rates throughout the year 
the company s percentage of debt to capitalization ratio of continues to remain relatively low  reflecting management s conservative debt philosophy 
the provision for federal and state income taxes reflects an effective rate of in fiscal compared to an effective rate of in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in the federal income tax rate bracket as a result of the company s income growth 
the company believes that there will be sufficient taxable income in future periods to enable utilization of available deferred income tax benefits 
compared to the revenue growth trend established in fiscal continued for the fourth consecutive year 
gross revenue increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal net service revenue increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal these increases were due to a combination of internal growth arising out of increased revenue from the company s services including  as expected  revenue from the exit strategy and power markets  and the additional revenue from acquisitions made in fiscal and internal growth provided approximately of the increase in net service revenue in fiscal  and the net service revenue from acquisitions represented approximately of the increase 
net service revenue from acquired companies is considered part of acquisition growth during the first twelve months from the date acquired 
as a percentage of net service revenue  cost of services decreased to in fiscal  from in fiscal this decrease contributed directly to an increase in income from operations as a percentage of net service revenue operating margin  which increased from last year to 
the increase in cost of services of approximately in fiscal was primarily due to additional operating costs incurred to support the increase in net service revenue and additional operating costs associated with the businesses acquired in fiscal and as a percentage of net service revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased from in fiscal  to in fiscal this is a result of controlling overhead at a growth rate below that of revenue  and also contributes directly to an increase in income from operations as a percentage of net service revenue 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately in fiscal was primarily from additional costs necessary to support the company s internal and acquisition growth 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of net service revenue in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  also contributed to a higher operating margin 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to the additional goodwill amortization associated with businesses acquired in fiscal and the related additional purchase price payments comprised of cash and stock recorded in fiscal associated with those acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  the additional depreciation expense on equipment acquired through acquisitions 
income from operations increased approximately to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the continued improvement in operating performance was primarily due to the company s focus toward higher margin  economically driven markets such as the exit strategy and power sectors and the growth in revenue without comparable increases in operating overhead 
the fiscal growth in operating income was equally balanced between internal growth and growth from acquisitions 
interest expense increased approximately in fiscal  as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to higher levels of average debt outstanding during the year to finance acquisitions completed in fiscal and the company s percentage of debt to capitalization ratio continues to remain low  reflecting management s conservative philosophy 
the provision for federal and state income taxes reflects an effective rate of in fiscal  compared to in fiscal this increase was primarily due to nondeductible goodwill amortization resulting from the acquisitions completed in fiscal and the company believes that there will be sufficient taxable income in future periods to enable utilization of available deferred income tax benefits 
impact of inflation the company s operations have not been materially affected by inflation or changing prices because of the short term nature of many of its contracts and the fact that most contracts of a longer term are subject to adjustment or have been priced to cover anticipated increases in labor and other costs 
liquidity and capital resources the company primarily relies on cash from operations and financing activities  including borrowings based upon the strength of its balance sheet  to fund operations 
as discussed below  the cash generated from operations  the cash on hand at june  and available borrowings under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements for currently anticipated activities 
the company s liquidity is assessed in terms of its overall ability to generate cash to fund its operating and investing activities and to reduce debt 
of particular importance in the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  acquisitions  capital expenditure levels and an adequate bank line of credit 
cash flows from operating activities were approximately million in fiscal  compared to million last year 
the decrease in year to year operating cash flows was primarily the result of changes in billings in advance of revenue earned  which fluctuate primarily depending on the number of new exit strategy contracts entered into during each year 
billings in advance of revenue earned primarily represents amounts collected in accordance with contractual terms in advance of when the work is performed on exit strategy contracts 
these prepayments provide the company with an advance source of cash for one to several years 
during years when the amount of prepayments from new exit strategy contracts exceeds the amount of revenue recognized as work is performed on the contracts  billings in advance of revenue earned will increase and thereby provide operating cash flow 
for instance  during fiscal  the increase in billings in advance of revenue earned contributed million towards the total cash provided by operating activities 
however  during years when the amount of revenue recognized from work performed exceeds the amount of prepayments from new exit strategy contracts  billings in advance of revenue earned will decrease and reduce operating cash flow 
during fiscal  the decrease in billings in advance of revenue earned reduced operating cash flow by million 
operating cash flows are also increased by non cash charges for depreciation and amortization million for the year ended june   and typically decreased by accounts receivable associated with the company s revenue growth million for the year ended june  
also  over time  operating cash flows can be either increased or decreased by changes in the long term insurance receivable 
for the year ended june   operating cash flows decreased by the million increase in the long term insurance receivable 
overall accounts receivable and long term receivable characteristics for the company are discussed in the following paragraphs 
accounts receivable include both billed receivables associated with invoices submitted for work previously completed and unbilled receivables work in progress 
the unbilled receivables are primarily related to work performed in the last month of the fiscal year 
the magnitude of the accounts receivable for a professional services company is typically evaluated as days sales outstanding dso  which is calculated by dividing both current and long term receivables by the most recent six month average of daily gross revenue  adjusted to include gross revenue from acquired entities to the extent it is not already included in the company s gross revenue 
at june   the company s dso was approximately days 
dso would have been days at june  if the site acquisition was excluded from the calculation 
this compares favorably to dso of days at june  management s long term goal is to reduce dso to days 
funding and risk management for exit strategy projects is generally provided by a finite risk cost cap insurance policy issued by the company s insurer  american international group aig 
the policy provides protection against potential increases in the cost of the projects 
the company generally receives the contract price as a prepayment from its customer and a substantial portion of that prepayment is deposited with aig pursuant to the policy 
aig then pays the company from the deposited funds as work is performed 
the long term insurance receivable is associated with amounts held by aig for work performed but which are currently not yet payable under the terms of the policy 
these amounts will be paid as the company completes certain project milestones eg  completion of capital improvements 
the effect on periodic operating cash flows will vary depending upon the mix of work performed but not yet payable and amounts reimbursed to the company by aig 
as a result of these factors  some periods will have a high operating cash flow to net income relationship 
in others  this relationship will be lower 
over longer periods the effect should tend to be normalized with an overall positive operating cash flow trend 
investing activities used cash of approximately million during the year ended june   primarily consisting of million for acquisitions and additional purchase price payments and approximately million in capital expenditures for additional information technology and other equipment to support business growth 
financing activities provided cash of approximately million during the year ended june  to support operating and investing activities 
the private placement of a new class of preferred stock in december   provided million net of issuance costs and the remaining million was primarily provided by net borrowings from the company s credit facility and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
the company has no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
in march  the company entered into a new banking arrangement with wachovia bank  na that provides a revolving credit facility of up to million to support various short term operating and investing activities 
the initial availability under the facility was million 
in september  the agreement was amended to increase the aggregate amount available to million 
borrowings under the agreement bear interest at the bank s base rate or the eurodollar rate plus or minus applicable margins and are due and payable in march when the agreement expires 
borrowings under the agreement are collateralized by accounts receivable 
the agreement contains various covenants including  but not limited to  restrictions related to net worth  ebitda  leverage  asset sales  mergers and acquisitions  creation of liens and dividends on common stock other than stock dividends 
at june   outstanding borrowings pursuant to the agreement were million  at an average interest rate of 
we expect that the cash generated from operations  the cash on hand at june  and available borrowings under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements for currently anticipated activities 
if in the future the company pursues acquisitions in which the potential cash consideration approaches or exceeds the availability of current sources  the company would either increase its lending facility or pursue additional financing
