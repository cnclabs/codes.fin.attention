item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on december   in a tax free transaction  marathon oil corporation marathon  formerly usx corporation  converted each share of its usx u 
s 
steel group class of common stock steel stock into the right to receive one share of united states steel corporation common stock separation 
the net assets of united states steel on december  were approximately the same as the net assets attributable to steel stock at the time of the separation  except for a value transfer of million in the form of additional net debt and other financings retained by marathon 
during the last six months of  united states steel completed a number of financings so that  upon the separation  the net debt and other financings of united states steel on a stand alone basis were approximately equal to the net debt and other financings attributable to the steel stock less the value transfer and the tax settlement with marathon

certain sections of management s discussion and analysis include forward looking statements concerning trends or events potentially affecting the businesses of united states steel 
these statements typically contain words such as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects or similar words indicating that future outcomes are not known with certainty and are subject to risk factors that could cause these outcomes to differ significantly from those projected 
in accordance with safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors  though not necessarily all such factors  that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in forward looking statements 
for additional risk factors affecting the businesses of united states steel  see supplementary data disclosures about forward looking information 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon united states steel s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the year 
management regularly evaluates these estimates  including those related to the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  valuation allowances for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  liabilities for deferred income taxes  potential tax deficiencies  environmental obligations  potential litigation claims and settlements  and assets and obligations related to employee benefits 
management estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from current expectations under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
depreciation united states steel records depreciation primarily using a modified straight line method based upon estimated lives of assets and production levels 
the modification factors for domestic steel producing assets range from a minimum of at a production level below of capability  to a maximum of for a production level 
no modification is made at the production level  considered the normal long range level 
depreciation charges for  and were  and  respectively  of straight line depreciation based on production levels for each of the years 
for certain equipment related to railroad operations  depreciation is recorded on the straight line method  utilizing a composite or grouped approach  based on estimated lives of assets 
asset impairments united states steel evaluates the impairment of its property  plant and equipment on an individual asset basis or by logical groupings of assets 
asset impairments are recognized when the carrying value of those productive assets exceed their aggregate projected undiscounted cash flows 
if future demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional asset write downs may be required 
allowances for doubtful accounts united states steel maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories united states steel determines the cost of inventories primarily under the last in  first out lifo method 
consequently  the overall carrying value of inventories is significantly less than the replacement cost 
united states steel writes down inventories for the difference between the carrying value of the inventories and the estimated market value on a worldwide basis 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
deferred taxes united states steel records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while united states steel has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that united states steel were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should united states steel determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
united states steel makes no provision for deferred us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of ussk and other consolidated foreign subsidiaries because management intends to permanently reinvest such earnings in foreign operations 
if circumstances change and it is determined that earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future  a charge would be required to record the us deferred tax liability for the amounts planned to be remitted 
liabilities for potential tax deficiencies united states steel records liabilities for potential tax deficiencies 
these liabilities are based on management s judgment of the risk of loss should those items be challenged by taxing authorities 
in the event that united states steel were to determine that tax related items would not be considered deficiencies or that items previously not considered to be potential deficiencies could be considered as potential tax deficiencies as a result of an audit  tax ruling or other positions or authority an adjustment to the liability would be recorded through income in the period such determination was made 
environmental remediation united states steel provides for remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable 
remediation liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposures and are discounted in certain instances 
united states steel regularly monitors the progress of environmental remediation 
should studies indicate that the cost of remediation is to be more than previously estimated  an additional accrual would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made 
accruals for potential litigation claims and settlements united states steel records accruals for potential litigation claims and settlements when legal counsel advises that an obligation is probable and reasonably estimable 
changes in findings and negotiations as the cases progress cause changes in the recorded accruals 
pensions and other postretirement benefits opeb net pension and opeb expense recorded for pension and other postretirement benefits are based on  among other things  assumptions of the discount rate  estimated return on plan assets  salary increases  the mortality of participants and the current level and escalation of health care costs in the future 
changes in these and other factors and differences between actual and assumed changes in the present value of liabilities or assets of united states steel s plans above certain thresholds could cause net annual expense to increase or decrease materially from year to year 
management s discussion and analysis of income due to the capital intensive nature of integrated steel production  the principal drivers of united states steel s financial results are price  volume and mix 
to the extent that these factors are affected by industry conditions and the overall economic climate  revenues and income will reflect such conditions 
revenues and other income for each of the last three years are summarized in the following table dollars in millions revenues by product sheet and semi finished steel products    tubular products plate and tin mill products  raw materials coal  coke and iron ore 
other a income loss from investees net gains on disposal of assets other income total revenues and other income    a includes revenue from the sale of steel production by products  real estate development  resource management  and engineering and consulting services and  beginning in  transportation services 
total revenues and other income increased by million in from primarily due to the inclusion of ussk revenues for the full year  the inclusion of transtar revenues following the reorganization and higher income from investees relating to the gain on the transtar reorganization  partially offset by lower domestic shipment volumes domestic steel shipments decreased  tons and lower average domestic steel product prices average prices decreased per ton 
total revenues and other income in increased by million from primarily due to the consolidation of lorain tubular effective january   higher average realized prices  particularly tubular product prices  and lower losses from investees  which  in  included a million charge for the impairment of united states steel s investment in uss kobe steel company uss kobe

d for further details  see note to the financial statements 
segment income loss for domestic steel domestic steel operations recorded a segment loss of million in versus segment income of million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in segment income was primarily due to lower prices  primarily for sheet products  lower domestic shipment volumes which resulted in less efficient operating rates and higher unit costs  lower income from coke and taconite pellet operations  lower results from tin operations during the phase out of operations at fairless and higher than anticipated start up and operating expenses associated with the march acquisition of east chicago tin  and business interruption effects at uss posco following the cold mill fire in may  some of which were offset by insurance recoveries already received in the second half of offsetting these decreases were improved results from coal operations due to improved operating and geological conditions as well as higher tubular prices during the first half of segment income for domestic steel operations in decreased million from the decrease in segment income for domestic steel was primarily due to lower throughput  lower income from raw materials operations  particularly coal operations  and lower sheet shipments resulting from high levels of imports 
segment income for u 
s 
steel kosice ussk segment income for the full year was million compared to million in for the period following united states steel s acquisition of ussk on november  the increase is primarily due to united states steel s full year of ownership  changes in commercial strategy  strong customer focused marketing and a favorable cost structure 
items not allocated to segments net periodic pension credits  which are primarily noncash  totaled million in  million in and million in the decrease of million in the net periodic pension credit from to was primarily due to the million effect of the transition asset being fully amortized in and an unfavorable change in the amortization of actuarial gains losses 
the increase of million from to was primarily due to a favorable change in the amortization of actuarial gains losses 
net periodic pension credits in and include settlement and termination effects 
for additional information on pensions  see note to the financial statements 
gain on transtar reorganization represents united states steel s share of the gain in because this was a transaction with a noncontrolling shareholder  transtar  inc recognized a gain by comparing the carrying value of the businesses sold to their fair value 
see note to financial statements 
insurance recoveries related to uss posco fire represent united states steel s share of insurance recoveries in excess of facility repair costs for the cold rolling mill fire at uss posco in asset impairments trade receivables were for charges related to receivables exposure from financially distressed steel companies  primarily republic  in and asset impairments other receivables were for charges related to retiree medical cost reimbursements owed by republic in in  impairment and other costs related to investments in equity investees totaled million to establish reserves against notes from republic and to represent united states steel s share of republic special charges which resulted from the completion of a financial restructuring of republic 
in  impairment and other costs related to investments in equity investees totaled million related to the impairment of united states steel s investment in uss kobe  costs related to the formation of republic and other non recurring equity investee charges 
income from operations in also included a loss on investment used to satisfy indexed debt obligations of million from the termination of ownership in rti international metals  inc rti 
for further discussion  see note to the financial statements 
costs related to fairless shutdown resulted from the permanent shutdown of the cold rolling and tin mill facilities at fairless works in costs related to the separation were for united states steel s share of professional fees and expenses and certain other costs directly attributable to the separation in asset impairments intangible asset was for the impairment of an intangible asset in related to the five year agreement for ltv to supply united states steel with pickled hot bands entered into in conjunction with the acquisition of ltv s tin mill products business 
asset impairments coal was for asset impairments at coal mines in alabama and west virginia in following a reassessment of long term prospects after adverse geological conditions were encountered 
environmental and legal contingencies relate to certain environmental and legal accruals in and the voluntary early retirement program pension settlement in relates to a favorable pension settlement primarily related to salaried employees 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million in as compared to the increase was due to several factors  including the million decrease in the net periodic pension credit previously discussed 
other contributing factors were the increase in costs in as a result of the ussk acquisition and the reorganization of transtar  separation costs and the impairment of retiree medical cost reimbursements owed by republic 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million from to was primarily due to a million decrease in the portion of the net periodic pension credit recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses  as well as increased costs following the acquisition of ussk 
net interest and other financial costs for each of the last three years are summarized in the following table dollars in millions net interest and other financial costs plus favorable adjustment to carrying value of indexed debt a favorable adjustment to interest related to prior years taxes 
net interest and other financial costs adjusted to exclude above item a in december  usx issued million of exchangeable notes due february  indexed debt indexed to the price of rti common stock 
the carrying value of indexed debt was adjusted quarterly to settlement value  based on changes in the value of rti common stock 
any resulting adjustment was credited to income and included in interest and other financial costs 
for further discussion of indexed debt  see note to the financial statements 
adjusted net interest and other financial costs increased by million in as compared with this increase was largely due to higher average debt levels  which resulted from negative cash flow and the elective funding for employee benefits and the acquisition of ussk  both of which occurred in the fourth quarter of adjusted net interest and other financial costs increased million in as compared with  primarily due to higher average debt levels 
the credit for income taxes in was million primarily as a result of higher losses from operations 
the credit included a million deferred tax benefit associated with the transtar reorganization 
in addition  as a result of slovak republic laws regarding tax credits and certain tax planning strategies to permanently reinvest earnings in foreign operations  virtually no income tax provision is recorded for ussk income 
if circumstances change and it is determined that earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future  a charge would be required to record the us deferred tax liability for the amounts planned to be remitted 
the provision for income taxes in decreased million compared to primarily due to a decline in income from operations  partially offset by higher state income taxes as certain previously recorded state tax benefits will not be utilized 
see also note to the financial statements 
the extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt of million  net of income tax benefit  in included a million loss resulting from the satisfaction of the indexed debt and a million loss for united states steel s share of republic s extraordinary loss related to the early extinguishment of debt

management s discussion and analysis of operations the year turned out to be an extremely difficult one for the domestic steel industry 
steel imports to the united states accounted for an estimated  and of the domestic steel market for  and  respectively 
in  imports of steel pipe increased and imports of hot rolled sheets decreased  compared to injurious levels of imports continued to disrupt an already weakened market in which domestic steel consumption plummeted from an annualized rate of million tons in the first half to million tons in the fourth quarter 
the average growth in the domestic economy predicted by economists never materialized largely due to a worldwide economic recession in the second half and the impact of the september tragedies 
contributing to the decline in net income was a decrease in average realized domestic prices of compared to the average and higher unit costs due to depressed production levels at all of our domestic plants 
total shipments from the domestic steel segment were million tons in  million tons in and million tons in  and comprised approximately of the domestic steel market in domestic steel shipments in were affected by a weak domestic economy  which reduced demand for sheet  plate and tubular products 
shipments in were reduced because of weak tubular markets 
high import levels impacted all three years 
exports accounted for approximately of our shipments from domestic steel in  in and in ussk shipments were million net tons in and million net tons in in the short period following the acquisition 
domestic raw steel production was million tons in  compared with million tons in and million tons in domestic raw steel production averaged of capability in  compared with of capability in and of capability in in  domestic raw steel production was negatively impacted by poor economic conditions and the high level of imports 
in  domestic raw steel production was negatively impacted by a planned reline at the gary works no 
blast furnace in july because of market conditions  united states steel limited its domestic production by keeping the gary works no 
blast furnace out of service until february because of market conditions  united states steel curtailed its domestic production by keeping the gary works no 
blast furnace out of service until february  after a scheduled reline was completed in mid august united states steel s stated annual domestic raw steel production capability was million tons in  and ussk raw steel production was million tons in  or of ussk s stated annual raw steel production capability of million net tons 
on november   united states steel joined with eight other producers and the independent steelworkers union to file trade cases against hot rolled carbon steel flat products from countries argentina  india  indonesia  kazakhstan  the netherlands  the people s republic of china  romania  south africa  taiwan  thailand and ukraine 
three days later  the uswa also entered the cases as a petitioner 
antidumping ad cases were filed against all the countries and countervailing duty cvd cases were filed against argentina  india  indonesia  south africa  and thailand 
the us department of commerce commerce has found margins in all of the cases 
the international trade commission itc had previously found material injury to the domestic industry in the cases against argentina and south africa  and  on november   the itc found material injury to the domestic industry in the cases against the remaining countries 
on september   united states steel joined with seven other producers to file trade cases against cold rolled carbon steel flat products from countries argentina  australia  belgium  brazil  china  france  germany  india  japan  korea  netherlands  new zealand  russia  south africa  spain  sweden  taiwan  thailand  turkey  and venezuela 
ad cases were filed against all the countries and cvd cases were filed against argentina  brazil  france  and korea 
on november   the itc determined that there is a reasonable indication that the us industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of the imports in question 
these cases will be the subject of continuing investigations at both commerce and the itc 
united states steel believes that the remedies provided by ad and cvd cases are insufficient to correct the widespread dumping and subsidy abuses that currently characterize steel imports into our country and has  therefore  urged the us government to take actions such as those in president bush s three part program to address the excessive imports of steel that have been depressing markets in the united states 
united states steel  nevertheless  intends to file additional ad and cvd petitions against unfairly traded imports that adversely impact  or threaten to adversely impact  the results of united states steel 
on march   president bush announced his decision in response to the prior finding of the itc under section that imports were a substantial cause of serious injury to the domestic steel industry 
slab imports will be subject to a quota of million metric tons in the first year on product shipped from countries other than canada and mexico  with excess imports subject to a tariff of 
the annual quota increases to million metric tons in the second year and million metric tons in the third year 
imports of finished carbon and alloy steel products hot rolled  cold rolled  coated  plate and tin mill products from developed countries will be subject to a tariff in the first year  decreasing to and in the second and third years  respectively 
imports of these finished products from developing countries will be subject to an anti surge mechanism to ensure they do not substantially increase their shipments from historic levels 
imports of finished flat rolled products from canada and mexico are not subject to the import remedies announced by the president 
the tariffs and quotas are effective as of march  an import licensing program applicable to imports covered by the above remedies will be implemented 
the application of the remedies is subject to various specific product exclusions 
the people s republic of china has filed a challenge to president bush s action with the world trade organization and other nations have indicated that they also intend to do so or to take other actions responding to the section remedies 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition  cash flows and liquidity current assets at year end decreased million from year end primarily due to the settlement in of the million income tax receivable from marathon established in  decreased trade receivables including receivables subject to a security interest  and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
the proceeds from the settlement of the income tax receivable from marathon were used to reduce debt attributed to united states steel 
investments and long term receivables decreased million from year end primarily due to the reorganization of transtar in march of  which converted an equity method investee into a consolidated subsidiary 
net property  plant and equipment at year end increased million from year end primarily due to the transtar reorganization and the acquisition of east chicago tin  which were noncash transactions 
current liabilities at year end decreased million from year end primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and long term debt due within one year  partially offset by an increase in accrued taxes and amounts payable to marathon in connection with the separation 
total long term debt and notes payable at december  was  million  million lower than year end the decrease in debt was primarily due to the million value transfer from marathon and the receipt of million of favorable tax settlements with marathon  partially offset by negative operating cash flow of million absent the marathon tax settlements  net cash used in investing activities of million  debt repayments of million and dividends paid of million 
employee benefit liabilities at december  increased million from year end of which million reflected mergers of liabilities associated with the transtar reorganization  the acquisition of ltv tin mill properties and medical expenses of former lorain works retirees paid by united states steel which are pending collection under republic bankruptcy proceedings 
the remainder of the increase was primarily due to ongoing accruals in excess of cash payments from company assets 
following the elective million voluntary employee benefit association veba funding in the fourth quarter of  which decreased the employee benefits liability  most union retiree medical claims are being paid from the veba instead of company assets 
preferred stock of subsidiary and mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of a subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated convertible debentures decreased million and million  respectively  from year end in connection with the separation 
these amounts were previously attributed to united states steel under the marathon capital structure 
net cash provided from operating activities of million increased in compared to the increase was primarily due to the receipt of favorable intergroup tax settlements from marathon totaling million in the period compared to a favorable intergroup settlement of million in the period and the absence of a million elective contribution to a veba and non union retiree life insurance trust 
the million tax settlement is reflected in net cash provided by operating activities primarily as favorable working capital changes of million related to the settlement of the income tax receivable established in arising from tax attributes primarily generated in the year  increases in net income of million for tax benefits generated by united states steel in  and net increases in all other items net of million for state tax benefits generated in the last two items were included in the million settlement with marathon  which occurred in as a result of the separation 
absent these intergroup tax settlements in and and the million of elective contributions in to a veba and non union retiree life insurance trust  net cash used in operating activities decreased by million 
cash payments of employee benefit liabilities were lower because million was paid from assets held in trust for the plan in compared to million in primarily as a result of approximately million of funds from the veba being used to pay retiree medical and life insurance benefits for union retirees in in addition  working capital improved 
these improvements were partially offset by decreased net income 
net cash used in operating activities in was million and reflected the million elective contribution to a veba  a million elective contribution to a non union retiree life insurance trust and an income tax receivable from marathon of million 
these unfavorable effects were partially offset by a million income tax settlement with marathon received in primarily for the year in accordance with the group tax allocation policy 
the million veba contribution has provided united states steel with the flexibility to pay ongoing costs of providing uswa retiree health care and life insurance benefits from the veba instead of from corporate cash flow 
net cash used in operating activities was million in including a net payment of million under a terminated accounts receivable program 
excluding the non recurring veba contributions and the accounts receivable facility termination as well as the tax settlements with marathon in both years  net cash provided from operating activities decreased million in due mainly to decreased profitability and an increase in working capital 
capital expenditures of million in included exercising a buyout option of a lease for half of the gary works no 
slab caster  repairs to the no 
blast furnace at the mon valley works  work on the no 
stove at the no 
blast furnace at gary works  the completion of the replacement coke battery thruwalls at gary works  the completion of an upgrade to the mon valley works cold reduction mill  systems development projects  and projects at ussk  including the tin mill expansion and the vacuum degasser project 
capital expenditures of million in included exercising an early buyout option of a lease for half of the gary works no 
slab caster  the continued replacement of coke battery thruwalls at gary works  installation of the remaining two coilers at the gary works hot strip mill  a blast furnace stove replacement at gary works  and the continuation of an upgrade to the mon valley works cold reduction mill 
capital expenditures of million in included the completion of the pickle line at mon valley works  the replacement of one coiler at the gary works hot strip mill  an upgrade to the mon valley works cold reduction mill  replacement of coke battery thruwalls at gary works  several projects at gary works allowing for production of specialized high strength steels  primarily for the automotive market  and completion of the conversion of the fairfield works pipemill to use rounds instead of square blooms 
contract commitments for capital expenditures at year end were million  compared with million at year end ussk has a commitment to the slovak government to spend million for a capital improvements program at ussk  subject to certain conditions  over a period commencing with the acquisition date and ending on december  as of december   ussk had spent million on this capital improvement program 
capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million  including million for ussk 
this estimate anticipates entering into operating leases for certain mobile and systems equipment  valued at approximately million  the acquisition of which would be included in capital spending if the leases are not completed 
major expenditures include the installation of a new quench and temper line at lorain tubular  continued information systems development at straightline  and projects at ussk  including continued work on the new tin and continuous annealing lines and the completion of the vacuum degasser 
over and above this capital spending  million will be paid to vsz by ussk in both and to complete payment for the ussk acquisition 
the preceding statement concerning expected capital expenditures is a forward looking statement 
this forward looking statement is based on assumptions  which can be affected by among other things levels of cash flow from operations  general economic conditions  business conditions  availability of capital  whether or not assets are purchased or financed by operating leases  and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions  explosions or fires  which could delay the timing of completion of particular capital projects 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from current expectations in the forward looking statement 
the acquisition of u 
s 
steel kosice sro  consisted of cash payments of million in and net cash payments of million in  which reflected million of cash payments in less million of cash acquired in the transaction 
two additional payments of million each are to be made to vsz in and related to the purchase 
the first quarter acquisition of east chicago tin and reorganization of transtar were noncash transactions 
see also note to the financial statements 
investees return of capital in of million reflected a return of capital on an investment in stock of vsz in which united states steel holds a interest 
net change in attributed portion of marathon consolidated debt and other financings was a decrease of million in compared to an increase of  million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in primarily reflected the net effects of cash provided from operating activities less cash used for investing activities and dividend payments 
the increase in primarily reflected the net effects of cash used in operating activities  including a veba contribution  cash used in investing activities  dividend payments and preferred stock repurchases 
the increase in primarily reflected the net effects of cash used in operating and investing activities and dividend payments 
dividends paid decreased million from year due to a decrease in the quarterly dividend rate from to per share paid to usx u 
s 
steel group common stockholders  effective with the june payment 
after the separation  united states steel established an initial quarterly dividend rate of per share effective with the march payment 
debt ratings as of december   moody s investor services  inc assigned a corporate credit rating of ba to united states steel with negative implications 
on january   standard poor s corp 
placed the bb corporate credit rating for united states steel on credit watch with negative implications 
additionally  moody s and standard poor s have assigned ba and bb  respectively  to united states steel s senior unsecured debt 
liquidity in november  united states steel entered into a five year receivables purchase agreement with financial institutions 
united states steel established a wholly owned subsidiary  united states steel receivables llc  which is a special purpose  bankruptcy remote entity that acquires  on a daily basis  eligible trade receivables generated by united states steel and certain of its subsidiaries 
fundings under the facility are limited to the lesser of eligible receivables or million 
as of february   united states steel had million of eligible receivables  of which million were sold  primarily to fund working capital needs to build inventory based on increased order rates 
in addition  united states steel entered into a three year revolving credit facility expiring december   that provides for borrowings of up to million secured by all domestic inventory and related assets inventory facility  including receivables other than those sold under the receivables purchase agreement 
as of february   million was available to united states steel under the inventory facility 
ussk has bank credit facilities aggregating million 
at december   there were no borrowings against these facilities 
if ussk were to default under the million outstanding loan  lenders could refuse to allow additional borrowing under the million facility  however  outstanding loans would not be called 
united states steel currently has senior notes outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the senior notes impose significant restrictions on united states steel such as the following restrictions on payments of dividends  limits on additional borrowings  including limiting the amount of borrowings secured by inventories or accounts receivable  limits on sale leasebacks  limits on the use of funds from asset sales and sale of the stock of subsidiaries  and restrictions on our ability to invest in joint ventures or make certain acquisitions 
the inventory facility imposes additional restrictions on united states steel including the following effective september   united states steel must meet an interest expense coverage ratio of at least to through march  and to thereafter and a leverage ratio of no more than to through december   to through march   to through june   to through september   to through march  and to thereafter  limitations on capital expenditures  and restrictions on investments 
if these covenants are breached or if we fail to make payments under our material debt obligations or the receivables purchase agreement  creditors would be able to terminate their commitments to make further loans  declare their outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and foreclose on any collateral  and it may also cause termination events to occur under the receivables purchase agreement and a default under the senior notes 
additional indebtedness that united states steel may incur in the future may also contain similar covenants  as well as other restrictive provisions 
cross default and cross acceleration clauses in the receivables purchase agreement  the inventory facility  the senior notes and any future additional indebtedness could have an adverse effect upon our financial position and liquidity 
united states steel has utilized surety bonds to provide financial assurance for certain transactions and business activities 
the total amount of active surety bonds currently being used for financial assurance purposes is approximately million 
recent events have caused major changes in the surety bond market including significant increases in surety bond premiums 
these factors  together with our non investment grade credit rating  may cause united states steel to replace some surety bonds with other forms of financial assurance  or provide some form of collateral to the surety bond providers in order to keep bonds in place 
the other forms of financial assurance or collateral could include financial instruments that are supported by either the receivables purchase agreement or inventory facility 
the use of these types of financial instruments for financial assurance and collateral will have a negative impact on liquidity 
united states steel is contingently liable for debt and other obligations of marathon in the amount of million as of december  marathon is not limited by agreement with united states steel as to the amount of indebtedness that it may incur 
in the event of the bankruptcy of marathon  these obligations for which united states steel is contingently liable  as well as obligations relating to industrial development and environmental improvement bonds and notes that were assumed by united states steel from marathon  may be declared immediately due and payable 
if that occurs  united states steel may not be able to satisfy such obligations 
see note to the financial statements for further information on the industrial development and environmental improvement bonds and notes assumed by united states steel 
in addition  if marathon loses its investment grade ratings  certain of these obligations will be considered indebtedness under the senior notes indenture and for covenant calculations under the inventory facility 
this occurrence could prevent united states steel from incurring additional indebtedness under the senior notes or may cause a default under the inventory facility

contingent lease payments have been excluded from the above table 
contingent lease payments relate to operating lease agreements that include a floating rental charge  which is associated to a variable component 
future contingent lease payments are not determinable to any degree of certainty 
united states steel s annual incurred contingent lease expense is disclosed in note to the financial statements 
additionally  recorded liabilities related to deferred income taxes  employee benefits and other liabilities that may have an impact on liquidity and cash flow in future periods are excluded from the above table 
united states steel management believes that our liquidity will be adequate to satisfy our obligations for the foreseeable future  including obligations to complete currently authorized capital spending programs 
future requirements for united states steel s business needs  including the funding of capital expenditures  debt service for financings incurred in relation to the separation  and any amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies  are expected to be financed by a combination of internally generated funds  proceeds from the sale of stock  borrowings and other external financing sources 
however  there is no assurance that our business will generate sufficient operating cash flow or that external financing sources will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs 
if there is a prolonged delay in the recovery of the manufacturing sector of the us economy  united states steel believes that it can maintain adequate liquidity through a combination of deferral of nonessential capital spending  sales of non strategic assets and other cash conservation measures 
united states steel management s opinion concerning liquidity and united states steel s ability to avail itself in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward looking statements are based on currently available information 
to the extent that this information proves to be inaccurate  future availability of financing may be adversely affected 
factors that could affect the availability of financing include the performance of united states steel as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities  levels of inventories and accounts receivable  the state of worldwide debt and equity markets  investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance  the overall us financial climate  and  in particular  with respect to borrowings  the levels of united states steel s outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies

management s discussion and analysis of environmental matters  litigation and contingencies united states steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance  and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations 
in recent years  these expenditures have been mainly for process changes in order to meet clean air act obligations  although ongoing compliance costs have also been significant 
to the extent these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of united states steel s products and services  operating results will be adversely affected 
united states steel believes that all of its domestic competitors are subject to similar environmental laws and regulations 
however  the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of its operating facilities  production processes and the specific products and services it provides 
to the extent that competitors are not required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations  the competitive position of united states steel could be adversely affected 
ussk is subject to the laws of the slovak republic 
the environmental laws of the slovak republic generally follow the requirements of the european union  which are comparable to domestic standards 
ussk has also entered into an agreement with the slovak government to bring  over time  its facilities into european union environmental compliance 
in addition  united states steel expects to incur capital and operating expenditures to meet environmental standards under the slovak republic s environmental laws for its ussk operation

united states steel s environmental capital expenditures accounted for  and of total capital expenditures in  and  respectively 
compliance expenditures represented of united states steel s total costs and expenses in and of united states steel s total costs and expenses in and remediation spending during to was mainly related to remediation activities at former and present operating locations 
these projects include remediation of contaminated sediments in a river that receives discharges from the gary works and the closure of permitted hazardous and non hazardous waste landfills 
the resource conservation and recovery act rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes 
besides affecting current waste disposal practices  rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations  the recycling of wastes and the regulation of storage tanks 
united states steel is in the study phase of rcra corrective action programs at its fairless works and its former geneva works 
a rcra corrective action program has been initiated at its gary works and its fairfield works 
until the studies are completed at these facilities  united states steel is unable to estimate the total cost of remediation activities that will be required 
united states steel has been notified that it is a potentially responsible party prp at waste sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla as of december  in addition  there are sites related to united states steel where it has received information requests or other indications that it may be a prp under cercla but where sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability or make any judgment as to the amount thereof 
there are also additional sites related to united states steel where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes  both federal and state  or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation 
at many of these sites  united states steel is one of a number of parties involved and the total cost of remediation  as well as united states steel s share thereof  is frequently dependent upon the outcome of investigations and remedial studies 
united states steel accrues for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable 
as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise  charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required

in october  united states steel was notified by the indiana department of environmental management idem acting as lead trustee  that idem and the us department of the interior had concluded a preliminary investigation of potential injuries to natural resources related to releases of hazardous substances from various municipal and industrial sources along the east branch of the grand calumet river and indiana harbor canal 
the public trustees completed a pre assessment screen pursuant to federal regulations and have determined to perform a natural resource damages assessment 
united states steel was identified as a prp along with other companies owning property along the river and harbor canal 
united states steel and eight other prps have formed a joint defense group 
the trustees notified the public of their plan for assessment and later adopted the plan 
in  the trustees concluded their assessment of sediment injuries  which includes a technical review of environmental conditions 
the prp joint defense group has proposed terms for the settlement of this claim  which have been endorsed by representatives of the trustees and the us environmental protection agency epa to be included in a consent decree that united states steel expects will resolve this claim 
in  united states steel entered into a consent decree with the epa which resolved alleged violations of the clean water act national pollution discharge elimination system npdes permit at gary works and provides for a sediment remediation project for a section of the grand calumet river that runs through gary works 
contemporaneously  united states steel entered into a consent decree with the public trustees  which resolves potential liability for natural resource damages on the same section of the grand calumet river 
in  united states steel paid civil penalties of million for the alleged water act violations and million in natural resource damages assessment costs 
in addition  united states steel will pay the public trustees million at the end of the remediation project for future monitoring costs and united states steel is obligated to purchase and restore several parcels of property that have been or will be conveyed to the trustees 
during the negotiations leading up to the settlement with epa  capital improvements were made to upgrade plant systems to comply with the npdes requirements 
as of december   the sediment remediation project is an approved final interim measure under the corrective action program for gary works and is expected to cost approximately million over the next five years 
estimated remediation and monitoring costs for this project have been accrued 
at the former duluth  minnesota works  united states steel spent a total of approximately million through the duluth works was listed by the minnesota pollution control agency under the minnesota environmental response and liability act on its permanent list of priorities 
the epa has consolidated and included the duluth works site with the other sites on the epa s national priorities list 
the duluth works cleanup has proceeded since united states steel is conducting an engineering study of the estuary sediments 
depending upon the method and extent of remediation at this site  future costs are presently unkown and indeterminable 
in  uss kobe  a joint venture between united states steel and kobe steel  ltd 
kobe  was the subject of a multi media audit by the epa that included an air  water and hazardous waste compliance review 
uss kobe and the epa entered into a tolling agreement pending issuance of the final audit and commenced settlement negotiations in july in august  the steelmaking and bar producing operations of uss kobe were combined with companies controlled by blackstone capital partners ii to form republic 
the tubular operations of uss kobe were transferred to a newly formed entity  lorain tubular company  llc lorain tubular  which operated as a joint venture between united states steel and kobe until december   when united states steel purchased all of kobe s interest in lorain tubular 
republic and united states steel are continuing negotiations with the epa 
most of the matters raised by the epa relate to republic s facilities  however  air discharges from united states steel s seamless pipe mill have also been cited 
united states steel will be responsible for matters relating to its facilities 
the final report and citations from the epa have not been issued 
in  united states steel and the pennsylvania department of environmental resources pader entered into a consent order to resolve an incident in january involving the alleged unauthorized discharge of benzene and other organic pollutants from clairton works in clairton  pa 
that consent order required united states steel to pay a penalty of  and a monthly payment of  for five years 
in  united states steel and the pader reached agreement to amend the consent order 
under the amended order  united states steel agreed to remediate the peters creek lagoon a former coke plant waste disposal site  to pay a penalty of  and to pay a monthly penalty of up to  each month until the former disposal site is closed 
remediation costs have amounted to million with another million presently projected to complete the project 
in  united states steel and three other prps agreed to the issuance of an administrative order by the epa to undertake emergency removal work at the municipal industrial disposal co 
site in elizabeth township  pa 
the cost of such removal  which has been completed  was approximately million  of which united states steel paid million 
the epa indicated that further remediation of this site would be required 
in october  the pader placed the site on the pennsylvania state superfund list and began a remedial investigation ri  which was issued in united states steel s share of any final allocation formula for cleanup of the entire site was never determined  however  based on presently available information  united states steel may have been responsible for as much as of the waste material deposited at the site 
the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep  formerly pader  issued its final feasibility study report for the entire site in august the report identifies and evaluates feasible remedial alternatives and selects three preferred alternatives 
these alternatives are estimated to cost from million to million 
consultants for united states steel have concluded that a less costly alternative should be employed at the site  which is estimated to cost million 
based on the allocation of liability that has been recognized for past site cleanup activities  the united states steel share of costs for this remedy would be approximately million 
united states steel is in the process of negotiating a consent decree with padep 
united states steel has submitted a conceptual remediation plan  which padep has approved 
united states steel will be submitting a remedial design plan based on the remediation plan 
padep is also seeking reimbursement for approximately million in costs 
united states steel could potentially be held responsible for an undetermined share of those costs 
in september  united states steel agreed to an administrative order on consent with the state of north carolina for the assessment and cleanup of a greensboro  nc fertilizer manufacturing site 
the site was owned by armour agriculture chemical company now named viad from to united states steel owned the site from to and sold the site to laroche industries in the agreed order allocated responsibility for assessment and cleanup costs as follows viad  united states steel and laroche  and laroche was appointed to be the lead party responsible for conducting the cleanup 
in march  united states steel was notified that laroche had filed for protection under the bankruptcy law 
on august   the allocation of responsibility for this site assessment and cleanup and the cost allocation was approved by the bankruptcy court in the laroche bankruptcy 
the estimated remediation costs are million to million 
united states steel s estimated share of these costs is million 
new or expanded environmental requirements  which could increase united states steel s environmental costs  may arise in the future 
united states steel intends to comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment  but since many of them are not fixed or presently determinable even under existing legislation and may be affected by future legislation  it is not possible to predict accurately the ultimate cost of compliance  including remediation costs which may be incurred and penalties which may be imposed 
however  based on presently available information  and existing laws and regulations as currently implemented  united states steel does not anticipate that environmental compliance expenditures including operating and maintenance and remediation will materially increase in united states steel s environmental capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million in primarily related to projects at gary works and at ussk approximately million 
predictions beyond can only be broad based estimates  which have varied  and will continue to vary  due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements  the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies to remediate sites  among other matters 
based upon currently identified projects  united states steel anticipates that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately million in including million for ussk  however  actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed 
united states steel has been and is a defendant in a large number of cases in which plaintiffs allege injury resulting from exposure to asbestos 
many of these cases involve multiple plaintiffs and most have multiple defendants 
these claims fall into three major groups claims made under certain federal and general maritime law by employees of the great lakes fleet or intercoastal fleet  former operations of united states steel  claims made by persons who performed work at united states steel facilities  and claims made by industrial workers allegedly exposed to an electrical cable product formerly manufactured by united states steel 
to date all actions resolved have been either dismissed or settled for immaterial amounts 
it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters  however  based upon present knowledge  united states steel believes that it is unlikely that the resolution of the remaining actions will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition 
this statement of belief is a forward looking statement 
predictions as to the outcome of pending litigation are subject to substantial uncertainties with respect to among other things factual and judicial determinations  and actual results could differ materially from those expressed in this forward looking statement 
united states steel is the subject of  or a party to  a number of pending or threatened legal actions  contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters  including laws and regulations relating to the environment  certain of which are discussed in note to the financial statements 
the ultimate resolution of these contingencies could  individually or in the aggregate  be material to the united states steel financial statements 
however  management believes that united states steel will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably to united states steel 
outlook for in november  domestic steel s order rate began to increase and this trend has continued into the first quarter 
sheet facilities are now fully loaded and spot market price increases are being implemented 
plate and tubular markets continue to reflect weak demand 
in the first quarter  domestic shipments are expected to improve and average realized prices are expected to be lower  largely due to product mix and the halt in production at desco as a result of the december fire 
united states steel and rouge plan to return desco to full production by the fourth quarter of ussk first quarter shipments and average realized prices are expected to be lower than fourth quarter for full year  domestic shipments are expected to be approximately million net tons and ussk shipments are expected to be approximately million net tons 
for the longer term  domestic shipment levels and realized prices will be influenced by the strength and timing of a recovery in the manufacturing sector of the domestic economy  levels of imported steel following the outcome of the president s section decision and production capability changes at domestic facilities 
many factors will determine the strength and timing of such recovery  and shipment levels and prices are also subject to many of the same factors 
for ussk  economic and political developments in europe  including many factors similar to those impacting domestic steel  will impact ussk s results of operations 
united states steel s income from operations includes net pension credits  which are primarily noncash  associated with all of united states steel s pension plans 
net pension credits were million in at the end of  united states steel s main pension plan s transition asset was fully amortized  decreasing the pension credit by million in and in future years for this component 
in addition  for the year  lower than expected market returns in the year and the mergers of transtar and ltv tin mill liabilities will further reduce net pension credits to approximately million  excluding settlements and any potential effects of consolidation or rationalization activities 
an unfavorable million settlement charge is expected in the first half of under the nonqualified pension plan relative to salaried employees accepting retirement under last year s verp 
a settlement effect is not currently expected under the qualified salaried pension plan in relative to the verp program 
the above includes forward looking statements concerning net pension credits which can vary depending upon the market performance of plan assets  changes in actuarial assumptions regarding discount rate and rate of return on plan assets  plan amendments affecting benefit payout levels and profile changes in the beneficiary populations being valued 
changes in any of these factors could cause net pension credits to change 
to the extent net pension credits decline in the future  income from operations would be adversely affected 
in its retiree medical estimates of escalation  united states steel projects an aggregate initial trend rate in that gradually reduces each year to an ultimate trend rate of in the year this was increased from a initial trend rate assumed for the rate reflects a weighting of various escalation rates on different components of the plan  with some rates as high as  after taking into consideration the demographics of the affected populations and the different utilization patterns of medicare versus pre medicare retirees

united states steel owns a investment in republic  through united states steel s ownership in republic technologies international holdings  llc  which is the sole owner of republic 
republic is a major purchaser of raw materials from united states steel and the primary supplier of rounds for our tubular facility in lorain  ohio 
during the first quarter of  united states steel discontinued applying the equity method of accounting since investments in and advances to republic had been reduced to zero 
united states steel now accounts for this investment under the cost method 
on april   republic filed to reorganize under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
republic has continued to supply the lorain mill since filing for bankruptcy 
during the first quarter of  as a result of republic s action  united states steel recorded a pretax charge of million for potentially uncollectible receivables from republic and recognized certain debt obligations of million previously assumed by republic 
due to further financial deterioration of republic during the balance of  united states steel recorded a pretax charge of million in the fourth quarter of related to a portion of the remaining republic trade receivables and retiree medical cost reimbursements owed by republic 
at december   united states steel s remaining financial exposure to republic was approximately million 
on january   united states steel announced that it had entered into an option agreement with nkk corporation nkk of japan 
the agreement grants united states steel an option to purchase  either directly or through a subsidiary  all of nkk s national steel corporation common stock and to restructure a million loan previously made to national steel by an nkk subsidiary 
nkk s ownership of national steel s common stock represents approximately of national s outstanding shares 
the option expires on june although united states steel has the ability to exercise the option at any time during its term  it is united states steel s current intent not to exercise the option or to consummate a merger with national steel unless a number of significant conditions are satisfied  including a substantial restructuring of national steel s debt and other obligations 
other significant conditions include the resolution of key contingencies related to the consolidation of the domestic steel industry  the financial viability of national steel and satisfactory general market conditions 
on march   national steel filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
any agreement with national steel will be subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court 
united states steel has publicly stated that it is willing to participate in consolidation of the domestic steel industry if it would be beneficial to our shareholders  creditors  customers and employees 
a number of important conditions must occur to facilitate such consolidation including implementation of president bush s three part program to address worldwide overcapacity  relief from the burden of costs related to retiree obligations of other domestic steel companies and a new progressive labor agreement 
on march   president bush announced a section trade remedy as discussed previously 
in addition  united states steel may make additional investments in central europe to grow our business and to better serve our customers who are seeking worldwide supply arrangements 
united states steel has responded to domestic competition resulting from excess steel industry capability by eliminating less efficient facilities  modernizing those that remain and entering into joint ventures  all with the objective of focusing production on higher value added products  where superior quality and special characteristics are of critical importance 
our business strategy is to maximize our investment in high end finishing assets and to minimize or redeploy our investment in domestic raw materials and hot ends 
the preceding statements concerning anticipated steel demand  steel pricing  and shipment levels are forward looking and are based upon assumptions as to future product prices and mix  and levels of steel production capability  production and shipments 
these forward looking statements can be affected by levels of imports following government action on section activities  domestic and international economies  domestic production capacity and customer demand 
in the event these assumptions prove to be inaccurate  actual results may differ significantly from those presently anticipated 
the potential exercise of the national steel option by united states steel  the negotiation and possible consummation of any merger or acquisition agreement  and the potential completion of any industry consolidation or acquisitions whether domestic or international are all subject to numerous conditions  some of which are described above 
many of these conditions depend upon actions of other parties  such as the federal government  the united steelworkers of america and foreign governments 
there is no assurance that the national steel option will be exercised  that any merger agreement will be negotiated and or consummated  or that any industry domestic or international consolidation in general will occur  nor any specificity concerning the terms upon which any of these might occur  other than the specific terms of the option agreement

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management opinion concerning derivative instruments united states steel uses commodity based and foreign currency derivative instruments to manage its price risk 
management has authorized the use of futures  forwards  swaps and options to manage exposure to price fluctuations related to the purchase of natural gas  heating oil and nonferrous metals and also certain business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
derivative instruments used for trading and other activities are marked to market and the resulting gains or losses are recognized in the current period in income from operations 
while united states steel s risk management activities generally reduce market risk exposure due to unfavorable commodity price changes for raw material purchases and products sold  such activities can also encompass strategies that assume price risk 
management believes that the use of derivative instruments  along with risk assessment procedures and internal controls  does not expose united states steel to material risk 
the use of derivative instruments could materially affect united states steel s results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods 
however  management believes that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on financial position or liquidity 
for a summary of accounting policies related to derivative instruments  see note to the financial statements 
commodity price risk and related risks in the normal course of its business  united states steel is exposed to market risk or price fluctuations related to the purchase  production or sale of steel products 
to a lesser extent  united states steel is exposed to price risk related to the purchase  production or sale of coal and coke and the purchase of natural gas  steel scrap  iron ore and pellets  and certain nonferrous metals used as raw materials 
united states steel s market risk strategy has generally been to obtain competitive prices for its products and services and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand 
however  united states steel uses derivative commodity instruments primarily over the counter commodity swaps to manage exposure to fluctuations in the purchase price of natural gas  heating oil and certain nonferrous metals 
the use of these instruments has not been significant in relation to united states steel s overall business activity 
sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on pretax income of hypothetical and decreases in commodity prices for open derivative commodity instruments as of december   and december   are provided in the following table 
dollars in millions incremental decrease in pretax income assuming a hypothetical price decrease of a commodity based derivative instruments zinc tin a with the adoption of sfas no 
 the definition of a derivative instrument has been expanded to include certain fixed price physical commodity contracts 
such instruments are included in the above table 
amounts reflect the estimated incremental effect on pretax income of hypothetical and decreases in closing commodity prices for each open contract position at december   and december  management evaluates the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments on an ongoing basis and adjusts strategies to reflect anticipated market conditions  changes in risk profiles and overall business objectives 
changes to the portfolio subsequent to december   may cause future pretax income effects to differ from those presented in the table 
united states steel uses otc commodity swaps to manage exposure to market risk related to the purchase of natural gas  heating oil and certain nonferrous metals 
united states steel recorded net pretax other than trading activity losses of million in  gains of million in and losses of million in these gains and losses were offset by changes in the realized prices of the underlying hedged commodities 
for additional quantitative information relating to derivative commodity instruments  including aggregate contract values and fair values  where appropriate  see note to the financial statements 
interest rate risk united states steel is subject to the effects of interest rate fluctuations on certain of its non derivative financial instruments

accordingly  these instruments are excluded from the table 
b see note to the financial statements for carrying value of instruments 
c reflects  by class of financial instrument  the estimated incremental effect of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates at december   and december   on the fair value of united states steel s non derivative financial instruments 
for financial liabilities  this assumes a decrease in the weighted average yield to maturity of united states steel s long term debt at december   and december  d for additional information  see note to the financial statements 
e includes amounts due within one year 
f fair value was based on market prices where available  or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities 
for additional information  see note to the financial statements 
g see note to the financial statements 
at december   united states steel s portfolio of long term debt was comprised primarily of fixed rate instruments 
therefore  the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to effects of interest rate fluctuations 
this sensitivity is illustrated by the million increase in the fair value of long term debt assuming a hypothetical decrease in interest rates 
however  united states steel s sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of its debt portfolio would unfavorably affect united states steel s results and cash flows only to the extent that united states steel elected to repurchase or otherwise retire all or a portion of its fixed rate debt portfolio at prices above carrying value 
foreign currency exchange rate risk united states steel is subject to the risk of price fluctuations related to anticipated revenues and operating costs  firm commitments for capital expenditures and existing assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than us dollars  in particular the euro and slovak koruna 
united states steel has not generally used derivative instruments to manage this risk 
however  united states steel has made limited use of forward currency contracts to manage exposure to certain currency price fluctuations 
at december   united states steel had no open forward currency contracts 
in november  the month in which united states steel had the most foreign currency exchange maturities  total notional maturities were million

safe harbor united states steel s quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forward looking statements with respect to management s opinion about risks associated with united states steel s use of derivative instruments 
these statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to market prices and industry supply of and demand for steel products and certain raw materials 
to the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate  future outcomes with respect to united states steel s hedging programs may differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements
