the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and  therefore  differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of total assets and on noninterest expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
inflationary pressures over the last few years have been modest  although the potential for future inflationary pressure is always present given changing trends in the economy 
one of the greatest external influences that impacts financial institutions is the interest rate environment 
during  the federal reserve aggressively reduced interest rates during the year in order to mitigate the effects of a slumping national economy 
interest rates were cut times during  resulting in a reduction of the prime lending rate from at january  to at december  the prime rate of represents a thirty year low in this key interest rate indicator 
the declines in interest rates experienced in were in contrast to interest rate movements in  in which the federal reserve incrementally raised interest rates four times  for a total increase in the prime lending rate of basis points bp the declining interest rate environment dictated by the federal reserve had an immediate impact on repricing variable interest rate interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which led to some compression in the net interest margin 
management recognizes that asset liability management  including the effect of rate changes on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  remains a critical responsibility in ensuring continuing profitability of the corporation

under the terms of the agreement  shareholders of equipment finance will receive consideration of million of which approximately will be paid in stock and in cash 
sterling issued approximately  shares of its common stock to acquire equipment finance 
the transaction closed on february  and was accounted for under the provisions of statement no 
the equipment finance acquisition will add approximately million in assets to sterling and is expected to be accretive to earnings per share during net interest income the primary source of sterling s traditional banking revenue is net interest income  which represents the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on liabilities used to fund those assets 
earning assets include loans  securities  and federal funds sold 
interest bearing funds include deposits and borrowings 
to compare the tax exempt yields to taxable yields  amounts are adjusted to pretax equivalents based on a federal corporate income tax rate 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates  volume of interest bearing assets and liabilities  and the composition of those assets and liabilities 
the interest rate spread and net interest margin are two common statistics related to changes in net interest income 
the interest rate spread represents the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is defined as the percentage of net interest income to average earning assets 
due to demand deposits and stockholders equity  the net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread  as these funding sources are noninterest bearing 
table presents net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis  interest rate spread and net interest margin for the years ending december   and table analyzes the changes in net interest income for the periods broken down by their rate and volume components 
tax equivalent net interest income in was  compared to  in and  in sterling has been able to increase its net interest income over the last two years primarily through increases in average earning assets  offset somewhat by a declining net interest rate spread 
the interest rate spread and net interest margin have experienced compression over the last three years 
the interest rate spread was in  down from in and in the net interest margin experienced similar declines  totaling in  down from in and in several factors impacted s net interest margin 
first  sterling is in a liability sensitive interest rate risk position  and in a rapidly falling rate environment like that experienced in  interest earning assets tend to reprice quicker than interest bearing liabilities  as a greater portion of assets are variable rate 
longer term funding sources  including certificates of deposits  have to reach their maturity date to reprice 
second  sterling had a less profitable interest earning asset mix  in which federal funds sold carried significantly higher balances as the corporation tried to increase liquidity to fund loan growth additionally  the market area served by sterling is highly competitive  resulting in financial institutions pricing quality credits competitively in order to increase volume 
finally  the decline in net interest margin was due to increased reliance on third party borrowings to fund both finance and operating leases 
this impacts the margin in two ways 
first  third party funding tends to be more costly than average rates paid on deposit accounts  and the interest expense associated with funding attributed to the operating lease portfolio increases interest expense  but the revenues earned on operating leases appear as rental income  and not interest income 
average earning assets were  in  an increase of over s balance of  average earning assets for totaled  loan growth was the primary contributor to the increase in average earning assets during these periods 
average loans totaled  for the year ended december   compared to  in and  in the favorable economic climate in sterling s market area has resulted in strong commercial loan demand  fueling the growth in the loan balances 
additionally  strong marketing efforts to professionals in the market area has resulted in increased referrals  as these professionals have a greater awareness of sterling s products and services 
sterling has also experienced growth in the consumer loan balances  due to effective marketing campaigns 
average securities were  in  versus  in and  in the increase in securities  in part  reflects the growth trends in deposits during the years 
strong deposit growth  which outpaced loan growth during the year  resulted in additional funding sources being invested in the security portfolio 
many of the securities have a relatively short duration that should provide sufficient liquidity to assist in the funding of loan demand during average interest bearing liabilities were  in  up from  in and  in funding needs to support loan and lease growth partially led to the increase in interest bearing liabilities in and  with the continued shift in mix from lower cost demand and savings deposits to time deposits and borrowed money

income from fiduciary activities  which includes both institutional trust and personal wealth management services  grew to  for the year ended december   up from  in and  in a higher level of assets under management supported the revenue increases in both and at december   sterling had total assets under administration of approximately million compared to million at the end of and million at the end of these numbers include assets under management of million  million and million at december   and the positive effects of new business development were able to offset the market declines in the past two years that would negatively influence fee based income 
this resulted in the positive gains noted in both income from fiduciary activities and assets under administration 
management strongly believes that wealth management business represents a significant growth opportunity for the corporation 
sterling will continue its concerted efforts to expand this business  including marketing efforts aimed at cross selling these services  and the hiring of experienced professionals 
in addition  effective january   the wealth management divisions of bank of lancaster county and bank of hanover were combined into a single entity  sterling financial trust company 
through the formation of a separate trust company  sterling believes it will be able to increase revenue generation opportunities  while increasing operating efficiencies 
other service charges  commissions and fees totaled  in  a increase over s total of  experienced a similar increase over s results  which totaled  increased customer debit card usage  higher fees implemented in the latter half of on non customer atm transactions and higher volumes of customers enrolled in cash management programs have led to the revenue increases in this category 
mortgage banking income totaled  in  compared to  in and  in mortgage banking income has been favorably influenced by the trend noted in the financial services industry  which has seen an increased volume of mortgage loan originations refinancing during this increase in originations refinancing volumes is the direct result of lower interest rates on mortgage loan products offered in versus this lower interest rate environment has accelerated prepayment speeds 
during  sterling recognized a  gain on the sale of maryland real estate  versus a  gain in rental income on operating leases has increased from  in to  in this follows an increase of in over results 
the increase in rental income is primarily due to an increase in the number of units under operating leases  which totaled   and  as of december   and sterling recognizes that leasing operations represent a growth opportunity for the corporation and has committed resources to expand this line of business 
these resources include increased marketing efforts  not only in developing new customer relationships  but also in maintaining existing customer relationships 
other operating income totaled  for the year ended december   an increase of  or  over s operating of  the increase is primarily attributable to the revenues generated from reinsurance credit life and disability activities that began in  through sterling s cayman island captive reinsurance company 
the  increase in other operating income in over is the result of normal increases in other operating income levels that have been supplemented in the current year with the reinsurance activities 
securities gains and losses  all from the available for sale portfolio  are summarized as follows net realized gains losses debt securities gains losses equity securities gains   losses gains and losses on debt securities are realized as part of ongoing investment portfolio and balance sheet management strategies 
equity security gains and losses are generated primarily through sterling s equity portfolio of financial institution sector stocks

as a result  training had to be completed for new employees  while severed employees worked through their arranged dates resulting in some redundancy of positions  increased overtime pay and temporary help incurred as result of the additional efforts required to ensure four successful core processing system conversions that occurred throughout  and increases in employee benefit costs  particularly health and welfare benefit plans  consistent with the increased health care cost trend noted nationwide 
net occupancy expense totaled  in   in and  in the increase experienced in was primarily the result of several branches that opened throughout  which were fully operational for the entire year 
additionally  expansion and renovations made at other existing branches led to the increase in occupancy expense 
similarly  the  or  increase in furniture and equipment expense during versus was the result of an increase in number of locations  as well as the increased maintenance costs associated with more sophisticated delivery channels offered to our customer base 
professional service expense totaled  for the year ended december   a increase over results 
this followed a decrease in professional service expense experienced in as compared to the increase in professional services can be attributed to the following factors sterling s continued reliance on services outsourced to third parties who can bring a greater degree of knowledge and experience to the organization that can be obtained internally  obtain temporary professional resources to assist in the four core processing conversions that took place throughout  legal and other consulting fees associated with the formation of two new business ventures  including sterling financial trust company and professional services group  and management s desire to increase awareness of the parent company s name 
as a result  professional service fees were incurred in establishing  reserving and preserving the sterling name in the communities served 
depreciation on operating lease assets totaled  in   in  and  in the and increases noted in and are consistent with the and increases noted in rental income on operating leases discussed above 
depreciation on operating lease assets as a percent of rental income on operating leases remained at approximately for all three years 
during the third quarter of  sterling completed its merger with hanover bancorp  inc and incurred  of merger related and restructuring charges 
the direct costs that resulted from the merger totaled  and consisted principally of legal  accounting  investment advising fees  as well as regulatory filing fees and other miscellaneous expenses 
in addition  sterling incurred restructuring costs totaling  which primarily consists of severance and related benefits  professional fees  termination fees related to non cancelable service contracts and asset write offs related to conversion of the banking subsidiaries into a common core processing system 
sterling expects the conversion of the banking subsidiaries into one common core processing system will result in operating efficiencies through a better leveraging of technology  a greater array of products being offered to customers  and better customer service 
the conversion to the new core processing system and resulting reduction in the workforce is expected to result in an estimated net annual savings of approximately million 
of this amount  approximately was realized in and will be realized in years and beyond 
the following summarizes the restructuring expenses charged to operations during  and the remaining restructuring accrual balance at december  the remaining unpaid expenses will be paid throughout initial remaining expense accrual employee termination asset disposal write downs noncancelable contracts professional fees other merger related costs during totaled  and was a direct result of sterling s acquisition of northeast bancorp  inc completed in june these merger expenses consisted entirely of attorney  accountant  investment advisory and application fees 
other noninterest expenses totaled  during  versus  in and  in significant expense components in this category include marketing and advertising  postage  utilities  mac fees  and pennsylvania shares tax 
the increase in expense noted during and was the direct result of sterling s overall growth  which requires many of these types of expenses to increase as well 
operating expenses levels are often measured by the efficiency ratio  which expresses noninterest expense  excluding merger related and restructuring charges  as a percentage of tax equivalent net interest income and other income 
in calculating its efficiency ratio  sterling nets depreciation on operating leases with the related rental income to more consistently present operating results with the banking industry 
the efficiency ratio was  and for the years ended december   and the deterioration in the efficiency ratio can be attributed to compression in the net interest margin  certain redundancies in operational staffing related to centralizing support units  and the opening of five denovo branches throughout and whose revenue streams are growing 
income taxes sterling recognized income taxes of  or of pre tax income  in income tax expense totaled  or of pretax income in  and  or of pre tax income in the variances from the federal statutory rate of are generally due to tax exempt income  investments in low income housing partnerships which qualify for federal tax credits  offset somewhat by certain non deductible merger related costs and state income taxes 
the decline in the effective tax rate during is a result of non deductible merger costs expensed in  with no similar costs incurred in the downward trend in the effective tax rate from to is consistent with the increase in tax free investment securities during this period 
financial condition average earning assets increased in to  from  in and  in solid growth in commercial loans  consumer loans  and finance leases contributed greatly to the increase in average earning assets 
additionally  sterling s security portfolio increased over the last three years  as a result of its funding exceeding the loan demand 
average funding sources  or interest bearing liabilities  increased in to  from  in and  in investment securities sterling utilizes investment securities to generate interest and dividend income  to manage interest rate risk  and to provide liquidity 
the growth in the security portfolio  in part  reflects the trends in loans  deposits  and borrowed funds during as deposit and borrowing growth outpaced loan growth during  excess funding was invested in the securities portfolio 
much of the investment activity focused on us government agencies  tax free municipal  and corporate securities 
these securities provide the appropriate characteristics with respect to yield and maturity relative to the management of the overall balance sheet 
at december   the securities balance included a net unrealized gain on available for sale securities of  versus a net unrealized gain of  at december  the reduction in long term interest rates at december  versus led to the appreciation in the fair value of securities during table investment securities the following table shows the amortized cost of the held to maturity securities owned by sterling as of the dates indicated

loans loans outstanding increased  or in  compared to growth experienced in the growth in loans is consistent with a stable local economy  and continued for loans to support existing customers growth 
the commercial loan portfolio experienced strong growth during the period  increased by  or 
this growth trend is consistent with the trend noted in prior years  and is the result of actively marketing commercial services to professionals in the target market  leading to an increased referral base 
additionally  sterling has been able to develop a network of regional community banks to participate loans 
the  decrease in real estate mortgage loans has been a result of increasing our emphasis on commercial loan products  combined with holding fewer mortgage loans for portfolio 
as mentioned previously  interest rates hit year lows  which produced a great deal of refinancings of portfolio loans 
given the low interest rates on newly originated loans  management has sold a higher percentage of mortgage loans in the secondary market than in the past in order to manage its interest rate risk position 
table loan portfolio the following table sets forth the composition of sterling s loan portfolio as of the dates indicated december  commercial  financial and agricultural      real estate construction      real estate mortgage      consumer      lease financing net of unearned income      total      table loan maturity and interest sensitivity the following table sets forth the maturity of the loan portfolio as of december  after one within one but within after five year five years years total commercial  financial and agricultural     real estate construction     loans due after one year totaling  have variable interest rates 
the remaining  in loans have fixed rates 
asset quality sterling s loan portfolios are subject to varying degrees of credit risk 
credit risk is mitigated through prudent underwriting standards  on going credit review  and monitoring and reporting asset quality measures 
additionally  loan portfolio diversification  limiting exposure to a single industry or borrower  and requiring collateral also reduces sterling s credit risk 
sterling s commercial  consumer and residential mortgage loans are principally to borrowers in south central pennsylvania and northern maryland 
as the majority of sterling s loans are located in this area  a substantial portion of the debtor s ability to honor their obligations may be affected by the level of economic activity in the market area 
the unemployment rate in sterling s market area remained below the national average during additionally  reasonably low interest rates  a stable local economy and minimal inflation continued to support favorable economic conditions in the area 
non performing assets include nonaccrual and restructured loans  accruing loans past due days or more and other foreclosed assets 
sterling s general policy has been to cease accruing interest on loans when management determines that a reasonable doubt exists as to the collectibility of additional interest 
when management places a loan on nonaccrual status  it reverses unpaid interest credited to income 
sterling recognizes income on these loans only to the extent that it receives cash payments 
sterling typically returns nonaccrual loans to performing status when the borrower brings the loan current and performs in accordance with contractual terms for a reasonable period of time 
sterling categorizes a loan as restructured if it changes the terms of the loan such as interest rate  repayment schedule or both  to terms that it otherwise would not have granted originally 
table nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans the following table presents information concerning the aggregate amount of nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans december  nonaccrual loans     accruing loans  past due days or more     restructured loans     total non performing loans      foreclosed assets total non performing assets      nonaccrual loans interest income that would have been recorded under original terms interest income recorded ratios non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total loans and foreclosed assets non performing assets to total assets as of december   total non performing assets totaled  an increase of  or from december  the increase in nonaccrual loans is primarily the result of two large credits that moved into nonaccrual status during one of these loans is fully secured by real estate  while the other loan is partially secured by real estate 
as a result of the increase in nonaccrual loans  sterling experienced an increase in non performing loans to total loans outstanding  as well as non performing assets to total loans and foreclosed assets 
however  these levels are within acceptable limits and are consistent with sterling s peer group 
potential problem loans are defined as performing loans that have characteristics that cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to perform under present loan repayment terms and which may result in the reporting of these loans as nonperforming loans in the future 
total potential problem loans approximated million at december  additionally  outstanding letter of credit commitments totaling approximately million could result in potential problem loans if drawn upon 
the majority of these loans are secured by real estate with acceptable loan to value ratios 
allowance for loan losses sterling maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level believed adequate by management to absorb potential losses in the loan portfolio and is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
quarterly  the company utilizes a defined methodology in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  which considers specific credit reviews  past loan loss historical experience  and qualitative factors 
this methodology  which has remained consistent for the past several years  results in an allowance consisting of two components  allocated and unallocated 
management assigns internal risk ratings to all commercial relationships with aggregate borrowings or commitments to extend credit in excess of  utilizing migration analysis for the previous eight quarters  management develops a loss factor test  which it then uses to estimate losses on impaired loans  potential problem loans and non classified loans 
when management finds loans with uncertain collectibility of principal and interest  it places those loans on the problem list  and evaluates them on a quarterly basis in order to estimate potential losses 
management s analysis considers adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of underlying collateral  and prevailing market conditions 
if management determines that a specific reserve allocation is not required  it assigns the general loss factor to determine the reserve 
for homogeneous loan types  such as consumer and residential mortgage loans  management bases specific allocations on the average loss ratio for the previous two years for each specific loan pool 
additionally  management adjusts projected loss ratios for other factors  including the following trends in delinquency levels  trends in non performing and potential problem loans  trends in composition  volume and terms of loans  effects in changes in lending policies or underwriting procedures  experience ability and depth of management  national and local economic conditions  concentrations in lending activities  other factors that management may deem appropriate 
management determines the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses based on the following criteria risk of error in the specific and general reserve allocations  other potential exposure in the loan portfolio  variances in management s assessment of national and local economic conditions  and other internal or external factors that management believes appropriate at that time 
management believes the above methodology accurately reflects losses inherent in the portfolio 
management charges actual loan losses to the allowance for loan losses 
management periodically updates the methodology discussed above  which reduces the difference between actual losses and estimated losses 
management bases the provision for loan losses  or lack of provision  on the overall analysis taking into account the methodology discussed above 
a summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses is as follows table summary of loan loss experience years ended december  beginning balance      loans charged off during year commercial  financial and agricultural  real estate mortgage consumer   lease financing total charge offs      recoveries commercial  financial and agricultural real estate mortgage consumer lease financing total recoveries net loans charged off    provision for loan losses     balance at end of year      ratio of net loans charged off to average loans outstanding ending allowance for loan losses to net loans charged off x x x x x net loans charged off to provision for loan losses allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans outstanding allowance for loan losses as a percent of non performing loans the allowance for loan losses decreased  from  at december  to  at december  the allowance represents of loans outstanding at december   versus as of the prior year end 
net charge offs totaled  for the year ended december   versus  in  an increase of 
a primary reason for the increase in charge offs was a charge off of approximately  in loans that were determined to have had fraudulent collateral associated with them 
during the first quarter of  sterling recovered  in insurance proceeds  which represents a large portion of the fraudulent loans 
additionally  consumer loan charge offs increased  primarily the result of our higher consumer debt and delinquencies 
the increase in the lease financing charge offs during as compared to previous years is the result of rising fuel prices  escalating insurance costs  and a downturn in the economy  which has led to increased delinquencies and subsequent charge offs of certain transportation industry lease receivables 
as a result of the increased net loan charge offs  sterling increased its provision for loan losses by  or 
table allocation of allowance for loan losses years ended december  loans loans loans loans loans to to to to to total total total total total amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans commercial  financial and agricultural      real estate  mortgage and construction consumer     leases unallocated      total      the allocation of the allowance for loan losses between the various loan portfolios has changed over the past few years  consistent with the historical net loss experience in each of the portfolios 
the largest reserve allocation is to the commercial  financial and agricultural loan portfolio  which represents approximately of the reserve balance 
despite a increase in this portfolio and higher charge offs of commercial loans during  the total reserve allocation has declined 
factors contributing to this decrease were the reserve allocation of  for fraudulent loans that were subsequently charged off in  and an overall improvement in the credit quality of the commercial loan portfolio 
in the first quarter of  sterling recovered approximately  of the fraudulent loan principal balance through insurance proceeds and recorded them as a recovery 
although nonaccrual loans have increased during the year  this was primarily the result of two large credits 
absent these two credits  the overall credit rating of the portfolio has improved since this nonhomogeneous loan portfolio continues to represent the greatest risk exposure to sterling  as the credits generally are significantly larger than the remainder of the portfolio and the related collateral is not as marketable 
additionally  other external factors such as competition for high rated credits have also been considered in allocating this reserve balance 
sterling sold its credit card portfolio in  which resulted in a significant improvement in net charge offs within the consumer loan portfolio since the sale of this portfolio 
over time  the allocation of the reserve of the consumer loan portfolio has declined  as the historical aggregate charge offs to average loans outstanding improves  thereby resulting in a lower reserve allocation on the existing portfolio 
further  management has been more aggressive in charging off consumer loans  which results in a portfolio requiring lower reserves 
this reduction in allocated allowance is due to continued decreases in net charge offs and enhanced performance in this portfolio 
during  the reserve allocation related to the lease portfolio has increased  consistent with the trends noted in lease charge offs during the period and continued uncertainty as to the impact of the economy on the slumping transportation industry 
over the past several years  the allowance for loan losses as a percent of outstanding loan balance has declined from at december  to at december  the unallocated portion of the allowance reflects estimated inherent losses within the portfolio that have not been detected 
the unallocated portion of the reserve results due to risk of error in the specific and general reserve allocations  other potential exposure in the loan portfolio  variances in management s assessment of national and local economic conditions  and other internal or external factors that management believes appropriate at the time 
while management believes sterling s allowance for loan losses is adequate based on information currently available  future adjustments to the reserve may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions  and management s assumptions as to future delinquencies or loss rates 
assets held for operating leases assets held for operating leases  net of accumulated deprecation  totaled  at december   an increase of  from the december  balance of  assets held for operating leases totaled  at december  the increase is a direct result of an increase in the number of units under operating leases  which totaled   and  as of december   and operating leases have residual value risk associated with them 
operating lease terms  including monthly rental payment and length of the lease  are established based upon the residual value  or the estimate of fair value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term 
if  at the end of the lease term  the fair value of the leased property is less than the residual value calculated at lease origination  a loss on disposal could result 
sterling mitigates this risk through the utilization of anticipated values published by various industries  and in some instances  discussions with industry experts 
further  the lease terms include provisions that the lessee shares the risk of loss on disposal of equipment  up to of the residual value 
deposits sterling continues to rely heavily on deposit growth as the primary source of funds for lending activities 
average deposits increased  or million  in this increase is consistent with the growth trend noted in this growth has been achieved through the development of products that meets the needs of our customers 
additionally  due to consumers confidence slipping in the stock and mutual fund markets  deposits have grown as these consumers migrate towards deposit products  which are generally regarded as safer  more liquid investments 
sterling will continue to explore new products for its customers  to mitigate increased consumer preference for higher risk investments  such as mutual funds and equity securities 
an example of this is the development of a cash management product that was promoted to customers that historically had their balances swept into a non deposit product

long term debt totaled  at december   an increase of  from december  sterling increased its reliance on long term debt during  including utilization of long term debt to reduce its short term obligations 
the increase in long term debt was a direct result of management s intention to capitalize on the year lows in interest rates  and matching finance and operating lease growth with these long term funds 
capital the management of capital in a regulated financial services industry must properly balance return on equity to stockholders while maintaining sufficient capital levels and related risk based capital ratios to satisfy regulatory requirements 
additionally  capital management must also consider acquisition opportunities that may exist  and the resulting accounting treatment 
sterling s capital management strategies have been developed to provide attractive rates of returns to stockholders  while maintaining its well capitalized position at each of the banking subsidiaries 
the primary source of additional capital to sterling is earnings retention  which represents net income less dividends declared 
during  sterling retained  or  of its net income 
stockholders equity also increased as a result of  in other comprehensive income  which relates exclusively to unrealized gains on securities available for sale

through december    shares have been repurchased under this program at an average price of 
sterling and its banking subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on sterling and the subsidiary banks financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  sterling and its banking subsidiaries must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and reclassifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require sterling and its banking subsidiaries to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier capital to average assets 
management believes  as of december  and that sterling and the subsidiary banks met all minimum capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject and are categorized as well capitalized 
there are no conditions or events since the notification that management believes have changed the subsidiary banks category

the liquidity of the parent company also represents an important aspect of liquidity management 
the parent company s cash outflows consist principally of dividends to shareholders and unallocated corporate expenses 
the main source of funding for the parent company is the dividends it receives from its banking subsidiaries 
federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid to the parent company from the subsidiary banks

new financial accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  requires all derivative instruments to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet 
this requirement is in contrast to previous accounting guidance  which did not require unrealized gains and losses on derivatives used for hedging purposes to be recorded in the financial statements 
the new statement does allow hedge accounting treatment for derivatives used to hedge various risks and sets forth specific criteria to be used to determine when hedge accounting can be applied 
hedge accounting treatment provides for changes in fair value or cash flows of both the derivative and the hedged item to be recognized in earnings in the same period 
statement no 
does not change the accounting for those derivative instruments not designated in a hedge accounting relationship  considered trading derivatives  for which fair value changes are recorded through earnings as they occur

considerations  were adopted by sterling as required on january  application of this statement did not have a material impact on sterling s financial condition or results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial institutions can be exposed to several market risks that may impact the value or future earnings capacity of an organization 
these risks involve interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange risk  commodity price risk and equity market price risk 
sterling s primary market risk is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is inherent because as a financial institution  sterling derives a significant amount of its operating revenue from purchasing funds customer deposits and borrowings at various terms and rates 
these funds are then invested into earning assets loans  leases  investments  etc 
at various terms and rates 
this risk is further discussed below 
equity market risk is not a significant risk to the corporation as equity investments on a cost basis comprise less than of corporate assets 
sterling does not have any exposure to foreign currency exchange risk or commodity price risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the exposure to fluctuations in the corporation s future earnings earnings at risk and value value at risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
this exposure results from differences between the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that reprice within a specified time period as a result of scheduled maturities and repayment and contractual interest rate changes 
the primary objective of the corporation s asset liability management process is to maximize current and future net interest income within acceptable levels of interest rate risk while satisfying liquidity and capital requirements 
management recognizes that a certain amount of interest rate risk is inherent and appropriate yet is not essential to the corporation s profitability 
thus the goal of interest rate risk management is to maintain a balance between risk and reward such that net interest income is maximized while risk is maintained at a tolerable level 
management endeavors to control the exposures to changes in interest rates by understanding  reviewing and making decisions based on its risk position 
the corporate and bank subsidiary asset liability committees are responsible for these decisions 
the corporation primarily uses the securities portfolios and fhlb advances to manage its interest rate risk position 
additionally  pricing  promotion and product development activities are directed in an effort to emphasize the loan and deposit term or repricing characteristics that best meet current interest rate risk objectives 
at present  the use of off balance sheet instruments is not significant 
the committees operate under management policies defining guidelines and limits on the level of risk 
these policies are approved by the boards of directors 
the corporation uses simulation analysis to assess earnings at risk and net present value analysis to assess value at risk 
these methods allow management to regularly monitor both the direction and magnitude of the corporation s interest rate risk exposure 
these modeling techniques involve assumptions and estimates that inherently cannot be measured with complete precision 
key assumptions in the analyses include maturity and repricing characteristics of both assets and liabilities  prepayments on amortizing assets  other imbedded options  non maturity deposit sensitivity and loan and deposit pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
however  the analyses are useful in quantifying risk and provide a relative gauge of the corporation s interest rate risk position over time 
earnings at risk simulation analysis evaluates the effect of upward and downward changes in market interest rates on future net interest income 
the analysis involves changing the interest rates used in determining net interest income over the next twelve months 
the resulting percentage change in net interest income in various rate scenarios is an indication of the corporation s shorter term interest rate risk 
the analysis utilizes a static balance sheet approach 
the measurement date balance sheet composition or mix is maintained over the simulation time period  with maturing and repayment dollars being rolled back into like instruments for new terms at current market rates 
additional assumptions are applied to modify volumes and pricing under the various rate scenarios 
these include prepayment assumptions on mortgage assets  the sensitivity of non maturity deposit rates  and other factors deemed significant 
the simulation analysis results are presented in the graph in table a 
these results as of december  indicate that the corporation would expect net interest income to decrease over the next twelve months by assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of and to increase by if rates shifted downward in the same manner 
this profile reflects a relatively neutral short term rate risk position and is with the guidelines set by policy 
at december   annual net interest income was expected to decrease by in the upward scenario and to increase by in the downward scenario 
the change in the risk position from year to year reflects the shift to a less liability sensitive position as projected over the next twelve months 
the change in the earnings at risk position is in part reflective of management s efforts throughout the year to extend liability maturities 
value at risk the net present value analysis provides information on the risk inherent in the balance sheet that might not be taken into account in the simulation analysis due to the shorter time horizon used in that analysis 
the net present value of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of expected asset cash flows minus the discounted present value of the expected liability cash flows 
the analysis involves changing the interest rates used in determining the expected cash flows and in discounting the cash flows 
the resulting percentage change in net present value in various rate scenarios is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet 
the net present value analysis results are presented in the graph in table b 
these results as of december  indicate that the net present value would decrease assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of and to increase if rates shifted downward in the same manner 
the risk position of sterling is within the guidelines set by policy 
at december   the analysis indicated that the net present value would decrease assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of and to increase if rates shifted downward in the same manner 
the change in the analysis results from year to year highlight that while efforts to extend liability maturities reduced the shorter term earnings at risk in the simulation analysis  growth in longer term assets and expectations for changes in asset prepayments and non maturity deposit lives and rates have created greater value at risk
