segments 
we classify our operations into three principal segments 
each segment s earnings before corporate interest and income taxes are reported to our chief operating decision makers 
general corporate expenses other than certain interest costs and certain amortization of financing costs have been allocated to each segment on the basis used for internal management decision making purposes 
we operates our business under three segments as follows o consumer electronics accessories business 
accessory products sold include tv antennas  music  camcorder  and photo storage cases  stereo headphones  universal remote controls  other accessories for home and mobile audio  camcorder  cellular and standard telephone  music  video  satellite  digital  computer and home office products  and products utilizing mhz and other wireless technology 
these products are marketed under numerous brand names including jensen  advent  ar acoustic research  recoton  discwasher  stinger  ambico and roadgear and  under license  sprint for telephone accessories 
the percentage of our net sales by this segment were approximately for the year ended december   for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  o audio business 
this segment primarily sells home and mobile audio and video products 
products for the home  sold under the jensen  advent  ar acoustic research and nht now hear this brand names and under the magnat and heco brand names in europe  include state of the art high fidelity stereo and home theater loudspeaker systems

the percentage of our net sales by this segment were approximately for the years ended december  and and for the year ended december  o video and computer game business 
products sold primarily under the interact and performance brands include joysticks  controllers  game steering wheels  rf modulators  memory cards and other accessories  and our popular gameshark  a device which assists game players to improve their play 
the percentage of our net sales by this segment were approximately for the year ended december   for the year ended december  and for the year ended december critical accounting policies and estimate the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required by the policies  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found the application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note a to the consolidated financial statements  located elsewhere in this k 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies which are described below 
merchandise inventory our merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
market development accruals we estimate expenses for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  price protection  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental expenses at the time the incentive is offered 
long lived assets in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of long lived asset  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long lived assets and reduce their carrying value by the excess  if any  of the result of such calculation 
we believe at this time that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives continues to be appropriate 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
deferred tax valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if we were to determine that it would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made

comparison for the years ended december  and net sales for the year ended december  totaled million  a decrease of million or from sales for the year ended december  of million 
the decrease in sales is primarily attributable to lower sales across all segments due to the general softening of the retail environment  the transition of the video game industry and the tragic events of september th 
sales by segment were as follows o net sales for the consumer electronics accessory business for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of compared to million for the year ended december  the decreases are primarily due to lower oem sales and a decline in our consumer electronic sales in europe

gross margins for the year ended december  decreased to from for the year ended december  gross margins by segment were as follows o gross margin for the consumer electronics accessories business increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  these increases were mainly due to product mix and a decrease in oem sales  which traditionally have a lower gross margin 
o gross margin for the audio business decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this was a result of our efforts to decrease inventory levels of more mature products to prepare for the launch of newer models in the later half of fiscal o gross margin for the video and computer game business decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this was primarily due to the general transition of the video game industry and competitive pricing pressures  cost of air freighting goods for product launches and certain inherent inefficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased by approximately million to million from million for the year ended december  and as a percent of sales increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the dollar decrease was mainly due to variable expenses as a result of lower sales volume 
increases as a percent of sales for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  are reflective of fixed costs being absorbed on lower sales volume 
operating income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the operating income decrease was primarily attributable to losses in our video and computer game business due to the transition of the industry 
sell through of older platform inventories  new product development costs  cost of air freighting third goods for product launches  k mart s bankruptcy  the high cost of maintaining party market leadership and certain inherent inefficiencies in our video game business 
we have engaged the services of a financial consultant to advise with respect to current operations with a view to increasing operating income  especially in the video and game segment 
interest expense decreased by approximately million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was attributable to lower interest rates and our present three year million senior credit facility which replaced our prior senior debt facility at a lower overall cost of funds see discussion under liquidity and capital resources senior loan agreement 
amortization of financing costs increased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this was mainly attributable to the debt refinancing in october on a consolidated basis  the loss before income taxes for the year ended december  was million compared to a loss before income taxes of million reported for the year ended december  the following is a discussion  on a segment basis  of income or loss before income taxes and unallocated expenses which expenses consist primarily of corporate interest and certain amortization of financing costs o income before income taxes and unallocated expenses for the consumer electronics accessories business for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is mainly due to a decrease in sales of oem products offset in part by increased sales of accessories products 
o income before income taxes and unallocated expenses for the audio business for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the general economic conditions and decreased gross profit as a result of the sale of more mature products during the first six months of to prepare for the launch of newer models in the later half of fiscal o the loss before income taxes and unallocated expenses for the video and computer game business for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the losses for the year were mainly due to the late launch mid november of new video game machines  pricing pressures on products associated with older video game platforms  new product development costs  cost of air freighting goods for product launches  k mart s bankruptcy  the high cost of maintaining third party market leadership and certain inherent inefficiencies 
in recent years  our income taxes and effective consolidated income tax rate have been materially affected by changes in the proportion of domestic and foreign earnings 
while earnings from operations in north america and western europe are primarily taxed at or above united states income tax rates  earnings from our asian operations are taxed at a current maximum rate of 
however  the actual tax rate from asian operations is dependent upon the proportion of earnings from mainland china 
our income tax provision for and is the result of a mix of foreign and domestic earnings and additional us income taxes on repatriated foreign earnings 
this resulted in a net income tax provision of million for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  we currently estimate that the balance of our asian retained earnings will remain indefinitely invested 
such estimate is subject to future revision based upon such factors as the results of domestic operations  ability to borrow or otherwise obtain funds to finance operations  market conditions in the consumer electronics industry and general economic conditions in the united states and in asia 
comprehensive loss is comprised of the net loss and foreign currency translation adjustments 
as a result of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar in relation to the euro and british pound currencies for the year ended december  and the fluctuations in value of the us dollar in relation to currencies in western europe for the year ended december  adjustments  net of income tax effect  were a negative million for the year ended december  and a negative million for the year ended december  total comprehensive loss for the year ended december  was million and for the year ended december  was million 
in the year ended december   basic and diluted loss per share was based on average outstanding shares of  in the year ended december   basic and diluted loss per share was based on average outstanding shares of  comparison for the years ended december  and certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period classifications net sales for the year ended december  totaled million  down approximately million or from the sales for the year ended december  of million 
the decreases in sales were primarily attributable to lower sales of our video game and computer products  as well as the elimination of poorly performing product lines in our international markets offset slightly by sales increases for the year in our consumer electronics accessory segment and domestic and german audio divisions 
sales by segment were as follows o net sales for the consumer electronics accessory business in were million  a decrease of compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to decreased sales of accessory products in recoton uk as well as decreases in satellite accessories and antennas in partially offset by increases sales of mhz wireless headphones and speakers  camcorder and video accessories  digitally compatible products and car audio accessories 
o net sales for the audio business in were million  a decrease of compared to million in the reduction is predominantly due to the sale of certain european assets as part of our reorganization offset by increased sales in our mobile audio products  home speaker products and german audio products 
o net sales for the video and computer game business in were million  a decrease of compared to in these decreases are primarily attributable to the initial launch shortages of the sony playstation video game platform and the general transition of the video game industry while consumers await the introduction of new platforms in gross margin in was compared to in however  in gross margin was adversely impacted by inventory write downs associated with our strategic plan see description below 
the gross margin before the inventory write downs in was 
gross margins by segment were as follows o gross margin for the consumer electronics accessories business increased to in from in gross margin before inventory write downs associated with our strategic plan in was these increases were mainly due to product mix 
o gross margin for the audio business increased to in from in gross margin before inventory write down associated with our strategic plan in was 
these increases were mainly due to the introduction of higher margin mobile audio products and the conversion of domestically manufactured home audio products to outsourced products 
o gross margin for the video and computer game business decreased to in from in this is primarily due to the increased competitive environment as dealers cleared out older products  the initial launch shortages of the sony playstation video game platform and the general transition of the video game industry while consumers await the introduction of new platforms in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in by approximately million to million from million in and decreased as a percent of net sales to in from in sg a expenses before costs associated with the strategic plan in were million or as a percent of sales 
these decreases were mainly due to cost savings and initiatives outlined in our strategic plan initiated in the second half of and decreased market development expenses and other variable expenses as a result of lower sales volume in the video and computer game segment 
operating income in improved million to million from million in operating income before write downs associated with our strategic plan and restructuring charges in was million 
the year to date operating income increases were mainly due to increased sales by the accessories segment  higher gross margins in the audio and accessories segments and reduced selling  general and administrative expenses as a result of our strategic plan  reduced market development and other variable expenses as a result of lower sales volume in the video and computer accessories segment 
interest expense increased by million to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to approximately million increase in the net present value of the make whole provision associated with our senior notes recorded in  increases in interest rates following the restructuring of our debt in september  as well as increases in the federal discount rate  which affected our variable rate debt 
amortization of financing costs increased to million in compared to million in this was mainly attributable to the debt restructuring in september and debt refinancing in october on a consolidated basis  the loss before income taxes and extraordinary item in was million compared to a loss before income taxes and extraordinary item of million in income before income taxes and extraordinary item in before charges associated with the strategic plan was million 
our losses in were mainly due to the continuation of higher cost financing because of delays in finalizing new financing arrangements and lower than anticipated sales of video and computer game accessories because of the significantly reduced quantities of the sony playstation video game system available at launch 
the following is a discussion  on a segment basis  of income or loss before income taxes and unallocated expenses which expenses consists primarily of corporate interest and certain amortization of financing costs and extraordinary item o income before income taxes  unallocated expenses and extraordinary item for the consumer electronics accessories business was million in compared to income of million in before restructuring and other charges associated with our strategic plan were recorded in income before income taxes  unallocated expenses and extraordinary item was million 
the improved results are mainly due to strategic cost savings  increased sales of products with higher gross margins and the strong sales of mhz wireless headphones and speakers  camcorder and video accessories  digitally compatible products and car audio accessories 
o income before income taxes  unallocated expenses and extraordinary item for the audio business was million in compared to a loss of million in before charges related to the strategic plan in  income before income taxes  unallocated expenses and extraordinary item was million 
the strong turnaround in the audio segment is mainly due to the initiatives outlined in our strategic plan  which consolidated the north american home audio division into the car audio group  moved our european distribution business into germany and eliminated poorly performing product lines in england and italy 
this  together with increased sales of higher margin mobile audio products  the conversion of domestically manufactured home audio products to outsourced products and the introduction of new products including car and marine receivers  speakers  and amplifiers  resulted in improved operating results on lower sales 
o the loss before income taxes  unallocated expenses and extraordinary item for the video and computer game business was million in compared to income of million in before charges associated with the strategic plan  income before income taxes  unallocated expenses and extraordinary item in was million 
the decrease in was mainly due to the initial launch shortages of the sony playstation video game platform  the general transition of the video game industry while consumers await the introduction of new platforms in and the competitive environment as dealers cleared out older products 
the extraordinary item of million recorded in relates to charges resulting from the debt refinancing 
the extraordinary item of million recorded in relates to charges resulting from the restructuring of our senior notes 
comprehensive loss is comprised of the net loss and foreign currency translation adjustments 
as a result of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar in relation to currencies in western europe for and adjustments  net of income tax effect  were a negative million in and a negative million in total comprehensive loss in was million and in was million

per share associated with the debt refinancing 
in  basic and diluted loss per share was based on average outstanding shares of  includes an extraordinary loss equal to per share associated with the strategic plan and restructuring of debt 
the effect of the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants is antidilutive and therefore is not reflected in the loss per share amounts 
impact of inflation and changing prices the impact of inflation and changing prices on our net sales and revenues and on income from continuing operations for the year ended december  and was negligible 
liquidity and capital resources sources and components of working capital 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  at december   we had working capital of million as compared to million at december  the decrease in working capital primarily resulted from a decrease in inventory levels 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december  and to at december  trade receivables increased million to million at december  as compared to million at december  inventory levels decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  accounts payable and accrued expenses were million at december  compared to million at december  senior loan agreement

our german subsidiaries entered into a million deutsche mark factoring facility up to approximately million with interest at over european libor

which in part supports a million letter of credit issued in favor of heller as security for the loans under the senior loan agreement 
the borrowings under the senior loan agreement and the subordinated loan agreement were secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our united states and canadian subsidiaries  and by of the capital stock of the other first tier foreign subsidiaries pursuant to certain guarantees  security agreements and pledge agreements 
the credit facility contains a number of significant covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness  repay other indebtedness  create liens on assets  make investments or acquisitions and engage in mergers or consolidations 
in addition  we are required to comply with specified ratios and tests  including quarterly and trailing twelve months ebitda as defined and minimum consolidated tangible net worth as defined and fixed charges coverage 
at the same time  modifications were made to the existing security purchase agreement with our senior subordinated creditors to reflect the subordination of the rights of the holders of notes issued pursuant to that agreement and the continuation of certain provisions of the september  master restructuring agreement entered into with our then existing creditors including an increased rate of interest see discussion below and a cash payment of  in connection with the refinancing  warrants to purchase  recoton corporation common shares were issued to the holders of the notes issued pursuant to the security purchase agreement 
warrants to purchase an aggregate of  recoton corporation common shares were issued to certain lenders under one of the new term loans pursuant to the senior loan agreement 
such warrants expire on october  and have an exercise price of 
sources of credit at december  as of december  we had credit facilities aggregating million 
the credit facilities include a million facility of which million was outstanding as at december  at march   our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility were approximately million and approximately million was available for borrowing 
the outstanding letters of credit under this facility as of december  were million  including standby letters of credit aggregating approximately million to a foreign bank for the benefit of our hong kong subsidiary primarily for import facilities and discounting of customer drafts  of which million in letters of credit and million in trust receipt loans were outstanding at december  at march   the outstanding letters of credit were million 
at december  and march   the deutsche mark factoring facility supported a million letter of credit issued in favor of heller as security for the loans in the united states under the senior loan agreement 
as of december  there was no debt outstanding for germany 
see the discussion above regarding debt refinancing and the discussion below regarding our outstanding notes 
in october the company also entered into a loan agreement with its then existing senior lenders for a million term loan with interest at over prime 
as of december  this boar interest of at december   we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants under the credit facility those relating to tangible net worth  minimum ebitda   fixed charge coverage and required minimum excess availability 
the bank lenders subsequently waived our non compliance with these covenants 
in connection with such waiver  the credit facility was amended to reset the covenant thresholds  authorize certain insurance premium financing  add certain additional covenants regarding minimum cumulative ebitda for our subsidiary interact international  inc  assess minimum excess availability at all times  modify the inventory advance rate limitation reducing it in steps starting september  from to of orderly liquidation value and increase interest rates on the revolver and term loan a by basis points 
this will bring the pricing on the revolver to prime plus or libor plus and term loan a to prime plus or libor plus 
in addition  we will pay the lenders an amendment fee of of their current outstanding commitment 
there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with the modified covenants in the future or that the lenders will waive or amend any of the covenants should we be in violation of any such covenants in the future 
in february  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due february  the notes with interest of 
under the terms of the agreement  we issued warrants to the noteholders to purchase  common shares at a price of per share which expire on february  in connection with debt restructuring in september  the exercise price of the warrants was reduced to a share and additional warrants to purchase  common shares at a price of a share were issued in place of warrants to purchase up to an additional  shares which would have been issuable in may if the subordinated debt had not been repaid by that date 
these warrants expire on september  on march  we entered into a month capital lease agreement with ibm credit corporation to finance approximately million in computer hardware  software and additional related expenses for the purpose of implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system see discussion below regarding capital expenditures for more information of which million was outstanding as of december  and million was outstanding as of march  a letter of credit aggregating approximately million was issued pursuant to the existing credit facility in favor of ibm credit corporation as security for the loan 
capital expenditures 
we have committed to implement a new global erp system to fully integrate functions such as finance  manufacturing  distribution and inventory management 
implementation for north american operations excluding aamp has been completed 
the estimated timeframe for full implementation of the erp system is currently july for european excluding italy and june for asian operations excluding japan 
the estimated cost of the project is approximately million including software licensing  hardware  consulting and related expenses 
see discussion above regarding the march capital lease agreement 
historically  we have financed capital expenditures with borrowings under our credit facility and cash flow from operations 
other capital expenditures relating to normal business expenditures which will be financed through working capital and our existing credit facility 
leases 
we have long term lease commitments and obligations at december  expiring at various dates through aggregating million 
foreign operations 
to date there has been limited exposure to loss due to foreign currency risks in our asian subsidiaries  because the hong kong dollar has been pegged to the us dollar at an official exchange rate of hk to us 
additionally  in recent years there have been no material fluctuations in the hong kong chinese exchange rates 
also  we maintain the majority of our currency in asia in us dollar accounts 
however  there have been discussions in hong kong about eliminating the peg and there can be no assurance that these relationships will continue 
our operations  which are currently being transacted on a global basis  are exposed to variations in foreign exchange rates 
shareholders equity was reduced by a foreign currency translation adjustment of approximately million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the changes in the exchange rates of the euro and british pound  which were the principle causes of the foreign translation adjustments in and the changes in the german and italian currencies against the american dollar  which were the principle causes of the foreign translation adjustments in  had no material impact on the consolidated results of operations but such adjustments serve to reduce our tangible net worth 
if there are any material adverse changes in the relationships between the european and or canadian currencies with the united states dollar or if the hong kong or chinese currencies should no longer be tied to the us dollar  such changes could adversely affect the results of our european  canadian and or asian operations included in the consolidated financial statements and could cause further increases in the amount of foreign currency translation adjustments which are charged directly to shareholders equity 
implications to the company from the adoption of a european common currency the countries of the european union have adopted a single currency  the euro 
the euro came into existence on january   and could have been used for transactions within and between the countries of the economic and monetary union austria  belgium  finland  france  germany  netherlands  ireland  italy  luxembourg  portugal and spain  with national currencies expressed as a denomination national currency units of the euro 
during the three year transition period following its introduction  countries were allowed to transact business both in the euro and in their own currencies at fixed exchange rates 
on january   the euro became the only currency in economic and monetary union countries 
we have extensive operations in certain european countries  including germany  italy and the united kingdom 
we also sell to additional countries in europe 
for the year ended december   approximately of our net sales were in europe 
with the exception of the united kingdom  all of the european countries in which we have operations adopted the euro 
we have not experienced  and do not anticipate that there will be  any material adverse impact on our accounting systems or our european business resulting from the adoption of the euro and any resulting changes in european economic and market conditions 
we adopted the euro for internal systems and reporting as of january  new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued two new pronouncements statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and supersedes apb no 
business combinations and fasb statement no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises 
all business combinations in the scope of this statement are to be accounted for using one method  the purchase method 
sfas is effective as follows a use of the pooling of interest method is prohibited for business combinations initiated after june   and b the provisions of sfas also apply to all business combinations accounted for by the purchase method that are completed after june  that is  the date of the acquisition is july or later 
we have determined that the adoption of this statement will not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes apb no 
 intangible assets 
it changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to either an impairment or periodic amortization approach depending on the intangible asset 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized in an entity s statement of financial position at that date  regardless of when those assets were initially recognized 
we are still evaluating the impact of this pronouncement as it pertains to unamortized goodwill 
amortization of goodwill for the year ended december  was million 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
sfas no 
is effective for the first quarter we do not believe that the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material impact on their consolidated results of operations 
in october of  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  but retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
for recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
however  sfas no 
applies the fair value method for testing of impairment  which differs from sfas no 
sfas no 
also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
as it pertains to the disposal of a business segment  but retains the requirement of that opinion to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
sfas no
