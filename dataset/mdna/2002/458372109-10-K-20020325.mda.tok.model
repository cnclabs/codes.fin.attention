the words expects  anticipates  believes  intends  will and similar expressions identify forward looking statements which are based on information available to us on the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in factors that may affect future operating results and elsewhere in this k 
general inter tel  incorporated in  is a single point of contact  full service provider of business communications systems  voice mail systems and networking applications 
we market and sell voice processing and unified messaging software  call accounting software  internet protocol ip telephony software  computer telephone integration cti applications  long distance calling services  and other communications services 
our products and services include the axxess by inter tel and eclipse by inter tel business communication systems  with integrated voice processing and unified messaging systems  ip telephony voice and data routers  and clearconnect talk to agent e commerce software 
we also provide maintenance  leasing and support services for our products 
our customers include business enterprises  government agencies and non profit organizations 
our common stock is quoted on the nasdaq national market system under the symbol intl 
we have developed a distribution network of direct sales offices  dealers and value added resellers vars  which sell our products to organizations throughout the united states and internationally  including to divisions of fortune companies  large service organizations and governmental agencies 
as of december   we had direct sales offices in the united states and one in japan  and a network of hundreds of dealers and vars around the world that purchase directly from us 
we also maintain a wholesale distribution office in the united kingdom that supplies inter tel s dealers and distributors throughout the uk and parts of europe 
in january  we acquired selected assets and assumed certain selected liabilities of mcleod usa  inc mcleod 
as a result  we added new direct sales offices and added personnel to other existing offices 
we integrated several of these offices into existing sales offices during sales of systems through our dealers and vars typically generate lower gross margins than sales through our direct sales organization  although direct sales typically require higher levels of selling  general and administrative expenses 
in addition  our long distance and network services typically generate lower gross margins than sales of software and system products 
accordingly  our margins may vary from period to period depending upon distribution channel and product mix 
in the event that sales through dealers or sales of long distance services increase as a percentage of net sales  our overall gross margin could decline 
our operating results depend upon a variety of factors  including the volume and timing of orders received during a period  the mix of products sold and the mix of distribution channels  general economic conditions  patterns of capital spending by customers  the timing of new product announcements and releases by us and our competitors  pricing pressures  the cost and effect of acquisitions and the availability and cost of products and components from our suppliers 
historically  a substantial portion of our net sales in a given quarter have been recorded in the third month of the quarter  with a concentration of such net sales in the last two weeks of the quarter 
in addition  we are subject to seasonal variations in our operating results  as net sales for the first and third quarters are frequently less than those experienced during the fourth and second quarters  respectively 
the markets served by us have been characterized by rapid technological changes and increasing customer requirements 
we have sought to address these requirements through the development of software enhancements and improvements to existing systems and the introduction of new products and applications 
inter tel s research and development efforts over the last several years have been focused primarily on the development of  and enhancements to  our axxess and eclipse systems  including adding new applications  incorporating ip convergence applications and ip telephones  developing unified messaging software applications  and expanding the telecommunications networking package to include networking over ip and frame relay networks 
over the last several years  our research and development efforts have also focused on the development of the clearconnect softphone and the related clearconnect talk to agent web communications software 
inter tel s current efforts are focused on developing and enhancing the ip telephony products and applications for our axxess and eclipse systems  increasing single site node capacity using an asynchronous transfer mode backbone using version axxess and eclipse software  enhancing our unified messaging software  developing a speech recognition and text to speech enabled unified communications product  developing an advanced ivr and ct application development tool  enhancing the ip digital telephones  and enhancing inter tel s server based pbx offering

net was due primarily to our sale of of inter tel 
net on july  accordingly  less than seven months of activity from inter tel 
net was reflected in the results as compared to the full year results of inter tel 
net reported in the decrease in net sales was also attributable to delayed customer buying decisions in related to a deterioration in macroeconomic conditions 
inter tel recognized lower revenues due to lower sales volumes of systems collectively through the direct sales offices  government and national accounts group  dealer channel and foreign operations  offset partially by sales increases in our lease finance operations 
in some instances  prices of various telecommunications systems decreased  and discounts or other promotions that were offered to customers to generate sales resulted in lower revenues

gross profit 
gross profit increased to million  or of net sales in  from million  or of net sales in excluding the executone restructuring charge  gross profit increased compared to million  or of net sales in this increase in gross profit was primarily a result of lower sales from inter tel 
net  which experienced negative gross margins  an increase in sales  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  through our direct sales channel compared to our dealer network  reduced product costs and higher relative recurring revenues 
gross profit also increased as a percentage of net sales  due in large part to items noted above 
these increases were offset by greater competitive pricing pressures in and by pricing discounts on telephone system sales 
excluding the operations of inter tel

net generated negative gross profit of million in compared to negative million in research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million  or of net sales in  from million  or of net sales in the decline is attributable in large part to the closure of the executone research and development operations in milford  connecticut in july accordingly  our costs did not reflect the executone expenses  compared to seven months of activity in in  research and development expenses were directed principally toward the continued development of the digital axxess and eclipse software and systems including version  unified messaging and voice processing software  interprise ip router solutions  talk to agent web e commerce solutions  speech recognition and text to speech applications  and certain cti and ivr applications

these expenses may vary  however  as a percentage of net sales 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of net sales in  from million  or of net sales in the increase in these expenses reflected an increase in costs associated with sales through our direct office channels compared to our dealer network  increased reserves for accounts receivable  and an increase in costs of maintaining additional facilities  including our new facilities in the phoenix metro area and the convergent offices acquired in january we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars  but may vary as a percentage of net sales

in connection with the sale of its interest in inter tel 
net in july  the company recorded a pre tax charge or million during  which reduced net income by million  or per share after tax 
this charge was associated with the impairment of our investment in inter tel 
net 
the impairment was measured as the difference between the carrying value of inter tel s interest in inter tel 
net and the estimated fair market value of the interest in the net assets of inter tel 
net 
we reported pre tax charges of million during  which reduced net income by million  or per share after tax

net assets of million during the second quarter  the equity share of cirilium s losses of million for the year  and write off of inter tel s investment in cirilium of million including reserve adjustments during the third quarter

without this charges  we would have reported net income of million per diluted share for the year ended december  interest and other income 
other income in both periods consisted primarily of interest income and foreign exchange rate gains and losses 
interest and other income decreased  in compared to the same period in principally as a result of lower levels of cash available for investment

however  gross profit decreased as a percentage of net sales  due in large part to increases in sales of ip and long distance services  which have lower gross margins than sales of our digital systems and software 
in addition  we experienced a lower proportion of sales through our direct sales offices compared to our dealer network  and were impacted by pricing discounts on telephone system sales 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of net sales in from million  or of net sales  in the increase was attributable in large part to the purchase of executone and related research and development operations in milford  connecticut in january accordingly  our costs included seven months of executone activity  compared to none in in  these expenses were directed principally toward the continued development of the axxess and eclipse business communication systems  unified messaging and voice processing software  interprise ip router solutions  clearconnect solutions and certain cti applications 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of net sales  in from million  or of net sales  in the increase reflected increased costs from continued development of the inter tel 
net network and related expenses  increased reserves for accounts receivable  additional personnel to support the direct dealer network  and selling  incentive  training and other compensation costs at our direct sales office operations

per diluted share  in inflation currency fluctuation inflation and currency fluctuations have not previously had a material impact on inter tel s operations 
international procurement agreements have traditionally been denominated in us currency 
moreover  a significant amount of contract manufacturing has been or is expected to be moved to alternative sources 
the expansion of international operations in the united kingdom and europe and increased sales  if any  in japan and other parts of asia could result in higher international sales as a percentage of total revenues  however  international revenues are currently not significant 
liquidity and capital resources at december   cash and equivalents totaled million  which represented an increase of approximately million from december  we maintain a million unsecured  revolving line of credit with bankone arizona  na  that is available through june  under the credit facility  we have the option to borrow at a prime rate or adjusted libor interest rate 
historically  we have used the credit facility primarily to support international letters of credit to suppliers 
during the year ended december   approximately million of available cash was used to repurchase our common stock and an additional million of available cash was used to fund acquisitions 
during the prior year ended december   we used approximately million to repurchase shares of our common stock and an additional million of available cash in acquisitions and joint ventures 
also during  we expended approximately million in the restructuring of the executone operations  including severance and related costs  the shut down and consolidation of the milford facility and the impairment of assets associated with the restructuring 
the remaining cash balances may be used for acquisitions  strategic alliances  working capital and general corporate purposes 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in cash provided by operating activities in primarily resulted from income from operations after considering the non cash portion of restructuring charges and the non cash depreciation and amortization expenses 
cash generated by the change in operating assets and liabilities in was million  compared to cash used by the change in operating assets and liabilities of million in at december   we achieved lower accounts receivable  inventory  prepaid expenses and other current assets than at december   which was primarily a result of close management of receivables and inventory and working down elevated levels of working capital assets acquired in the executone acquisition 
in addition  accounts payable at december  were lower than prior year end consistent with the lower inventory levels achieved 
we expect to expand sales through our direct sales office and dealer networks  which is expected to require the expenditure of working capital for increased accounts receivable and inventories 
net cash used in investing activities  primarily in the form of acquisitions and capital expenditures totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash used in acquisitions and investments in joint ventures totaled approximately million in compared to million in capital expenditures totaled approximately million for compared to million in net cash used in investing activities in were partially offset by cash received of million from the disposition of the manufacturing operations of executone 
we anticipate additional capital expenditures during  principally relating to expenditures for equipment and management information systems used in operations  facilities expansion and acquisition activities 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million during compared to million in we expended approximately million and million for stock repurchases during and  respectively  funded by existing cash balances during each period 
we issued long term debt  net of repayments  of million in and million in primarily in the form of long term capital leases to support capital additions to inter tel 
net prior to our divestiture of our majority ownership in july  during  we reissued treasury shares through stock option exercises and issuances  with the proceeds received totaling less than the cost basis of the treasury stock reissued 
accordingly  the difference was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings 
net cash used for cash dividends totaled million in and million during  which was offset in each period by cash provided by the exercise of stock options and stock issuances pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
we offer to our customers lease financing and other services  including our total solution formerly totalease program  through our inter tel leasing  inc subsidiary 
we fund our total solution program in part through the sale to financial institutions of rental income streams under the leases 
resold lease rentals totaling and million remain unbilled at december  and december   respectively 
we are obligated to repurchase such income streams in the event of defaults by lease customers and  accordingly  maintain reserves based on loss experience and past due accounts 
although we to date have been able to resell the rental streams from leases under the total solution program profitably and on a substantially current basis  the timing and profitability of lease resales could impact our business and operating results  particularly in an environment of fluctuating interest rates and economic uncertainty 
if we are required to repurchase rental streams and realizes losses thereon in amounts exceeding our reserves  our operating results will be adversely affected 
inter tel received a gross cash award of million in february in settlement of a binding arbitration claim 
income taxes  attorney s fees  expert witness costs  arbitration costs and additional costs and expenses  including million in bonus payments to employees who assisted in the litigation and arbitration  totaled approximately million in accordingly  net proceeds from this arbitration totaled approximately million 
this transaction concluded in  therefore no cash proceeds were included in the financial statements 
we believe that our working capital and credit facilities  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to develop and expand our business operations  to finance acquisitions of additional resellers of telephony products and other strategic acquisitions or corporate alliances  and to provide adequate working capital for the next twelve months 
however  to the extent that additional funds are required in the future to address working capital needs and to provide funding for capital expenditures  expansion of the business or additional acquisitions  we will seek additional financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when required or on acceptable terms 
critical accounting policies and estimates the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is both fixed and determinable and  iv collectibility is reasonably probable 
revenue derived from sales of systems and services to end user customers is recognized upon installation of the systems and performance of the services  respectively 
pre payments for communications services are deferred and recognized as revenue as the communications services are provided 
for shipments to dealers and other distributors  our revenues are recorded as products are shipped and services are rendered  because the sales process is complete 
these shipments are primarily to third party dealers and distributors and title passes when goods are shipped free on board shipping point 
long distance services revenues are recognized as service is provided 
sales leases 
for our sales type lease accounting  we follow the guidance provided by fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
we record the discounted present values of minimum rental payments under sales type leases as sales  net of provisions for continuing administration and other expenses over the lease period 
the costs of systems installed under these sales leases  net of residual values at the end of the lease periods  are recorded as costs of sales 
gains or losses resulting from the sale of rental income from such leases are recorded as net sales 
we maintain reserves against potential recourse following the resales based upon loss experience and past due accounts 
the allowance for uncollectible minimum lease payments and recourse liability at the end of the year represent reserves against the entire lease portfolio or allowance for collectibility from customers 
these reserves are either netted in the current and long term components of net investments in sales leases on the balance sheet  or included in long term liabilities on our balance sheet for off book leases 
goodwill and other identifiable intangibles 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical  expected or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  our market capitalization relative to net book value  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other identified intangibles may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  we will cease to amortize goodwill arising from acquisitions completed prior to july  inter tel has tested goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
inter tel has performed the first of the required impairment tests for goodwill as of january  and has determined that the carrying amount of goodwill is not impaired 
inter tel has adopted sfas effective january  application of the nonamortization provisions of sfas is expected to result in an increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes of approximately million in allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers or channel partners were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
additional reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded for our sales type leases  discussed above in sales leases 
inventories 
we value our inventories at lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method  including material  labor and factory overhead 
significant management judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because the product is outdated  or obsolete  or because the amount on hand is more than can be used to meet future need  or excess 
we currently consider all inventory that has no activity within one year as well as any additional specifically identified inventory to be excess 
we also provide for the total value of inventories that we determine to be obsolete based on criteria such as customer demand  product life cycles  changing technologies and market conditions 
we write down our excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
at december   our inventory reserves were million of our million gross inventories 
if actual customer demand  product life cycles  changing technologies and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
contingencies 
we are a party to various claims and litigation in the normal course of business 
management s current estimated range of liability related to various claims and pending litigation is based on claims for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending claims and litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
we also received correspondence during from a major competitor and subsidiary inviting us to negotiate a license agreement regarding the competitors patents 
we have continued to negotiate with these competitors regarding their patent claims as well as make claim for our patents 
we received additional correspondence in alleging intellectual property claims from another competitor 
inter tel responded by providing notice of consent to transfer license previously granted by this competitor 
we do not anticipate that the resolution of such matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
other charges inter tel 
net and ica 
during the second quarter of  inter tel recorded a pre tax charge associated with inter tel 
net operations of million million after tax  related to the write down to net realizable value of network equipment and lease termination costs of certain redundant facilities 
the reserves established at the time of the write down have been fully utilized as of december  the following table summarizes the details of the write down and activity in the reserve balances from the date of the write down through december  activity represents payments made or amounts written off

net subsidiary acquired the stock of intercomm americas  inc ica  an international ip communications reseller for  cash and  shares of inter tel 
net  with conversion rights into inter tel  incorporated common stock 
the acquisition purchase price was valued at million at march  the ica shareholders did not intend to exercise conversion rights 
however  due to market conditions  they decided to convert their inter tel 
net shares to inter tel shares in july based on the exercise of conversion rights in july  the valuation of purchase price of ica increased to million in accordance with the provisions of the acquisition agreement 
the conversion of inter tel 
net shares into inter tel  incorporated common stock was treated as an acquisition by inter tel of inter tel 
net shares  rather than as an adjustment to the original purchase price of ica  as the conversion rights were part of the original purchase agreement  even though the value of the conversion rights could not be readily determined at that time 
as a result  inter tel made adjustments totaling million to goodwill based on the value of the converted inter tel shares as of june  on july   inter tel agreed to sell of inter tel 
net to comm services corporation for a note of million  secured by comm services stock  other marketable securities of the shareholders of comm services and of the net assets of inter tel

additionally  any funds due comm services for services rendered can be applied against the note 
the note is due and payable on december   or earlier in certain circumstances 
in connection with the sale of of inter tel 
net  we assessed the fair value of the remaining investment in inter tel 
net 
pursuant to sfas  we recorded a charge as of the close of the second quarter of million million after tax associated with the impairment of our investment in inter tel 
net 
the impairment was measured as the difference between the carrying value of inter tel s interest in inter tel 
net comm services and the estimated current fair market value of the note plus the ownership interest in inter tel 
net 
the charge is primarily non cash 
inter tel s management has not participated in the management of inter tel 
net since the sale in july as a result  since july   we have accounted for the remaining inter tel 
net comm services investment using the cost method of accounting 
on december   comm services entered into a merger agreement with vianet 
inter tel s investment in comm services was converted to approximately of vianet stock 
the million loan was assumed by vianet and inter tel continues to hold collateral from the former shareholders of comm services 
inter tel will account for the remaining investment in vianet using the cost method of accounting 
the net investment in the notes receivable and interest in vianet formerly comm services is recorded in other assets for approximately million 
during  and  inter tel 
net entered into operating lease agreements totaling approximately million from an equipment vendor for network equipment and software 
the lease agreements required inter tel 
net to purchase vendor maintenance on their products 
inter tel originally guaranteed the indebtedness 
in the second quarter of  inter tel 
net notified the vendor of network and network equipment problems encountered due to equipment and software recommended by the vendor  and supplied and financed by this vendor 
inter tel 
net requested that the vendor not only solve the problems  but also compensate inter tel 
net for the problems and the resulting lost customers  lost revenues and lost profits 
pursuant to inter tel s sale of of inter tel 
net  comm services assumed the vendor lease and maintenance obligations and as such inter tel has not recorded any liability for these obligations 
however  the vendor has not released inter tel from its guarantee of these obligations and inter tel has not released the vendor from inter tel s claims  nor did we assign our rights to these claims to comm services 
executone 
on january  inter tel purchased certain computer telephony assets and assumed certain liabilities of executone information systems  inc executone for million in cash plus related acquisition costs  subject to purchase price adjustments as of the closing date 
the executone transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the aggregate purchase price was allocated to the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired  of which million million after taxes was written off as purchased in process research and development 
during the first quarter of  the executone division recognized losses of approximately million million after taxes  or 
per diluted share excluding the charge for in process research and development 
in connection with the executone acquisition  we sold executone s manufacturing assets and liabilities to varian of tempe  arizona at a net book value of million 
during the second quarter of  the executone division continued to experience significant losses 
the executone division recognized pre tax losses during the second quarter and six months ended june  of million  or million after tax 
per diluted share and million  or million after tax 
per diluted share  respectively 
as a result of these losses  together with other considerations noted below  we decided to close the primary executone facility in milford  connecticut and to recognize a restructuring charge related to the executone operations 
at the time the original purchase was recorded  we had not anticipated closing the milford facility 
after incurring higher than anticipated losses from executone operations and after a deterioration in the executone business  including loss of dealers and customers  delays in introduction and acceptance of new products  we decided it was in the best interests of us and our shareholders to close the milford facility and consolidate operations into our metro phoenix  arizona facilities 
we have accounted for the restructuring of the executone operations  including severance and related costs  the shut down and consolidation of the milford facility and the impairment of assets associated with the restructuring 
we finalized our plan for the exiting of activities and the involuntary termination or relocation of approximately employees in connection with the integration of executone operations 
accrued costs associated with this plan were estimates  although the original estimates made for the second quarter of for reserve balances have not changed significantly as of december  exit costs associated with the closure of the milford facility also included liabilities for building  furniture and equipment lease  and other contractual obligations 
we are liable for the lease on the milford buildings through january various furniture leases run concurrently through march other capital leases for computer and other equipment terminate on varying dates through september to date  we have entered into sublease agreements with third parties to sublease portions of the facility and equipment

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our non trading investment portfolio 
inter tel maintains a portfolio of highly liquid cash equivalents typically maturing in three months or less as of the date of purchase 
inter tel places its investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
given the short term nature of these investments  and that we have no borrowings outstanding other than short term letters of credit  we are not subject to significant interest rate risk 
lease portfolio 
we offer to our customers lease financing and other services  including our total solutions program  through our inter tel leasing subsidiary 
we fund these programs in part through the sale to financial institutions of rental income streams under the leases 
upon the sale of the rental income streams  we continue to service the leases and maintain limited recourse on the leases 
we maintain reserves for loan losses on all leases based on historical loss experience and specific account analysis 
although to date we have been able to resell the rental streams from leases under our lease programs profitably and on a substantially current basis  the timing and profitability of lease resales could impact our business and operating results  particularly in an environment of fluctuating interest rates and economic uncertainty 
if we were required to repurchase rental streams and realize losses thereon in amounts exceeding our reserves  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
see liquidity and capital resources in management s discussion and analysis and notes a and d to the financial statements for more information regarding our lease portfolio and financing 
impact of foreign currency rate changes 
we invoice the customers of our international subsidiaries primarily in the local currencies of our subsidiaries for product and service revenues 
inter tel is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
the impact of foreign currency rate changes have historically been insignificant
