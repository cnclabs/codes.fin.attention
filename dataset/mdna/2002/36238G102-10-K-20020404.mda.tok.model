com web site after our acquisition of fogdog on december   million was due to an increase in sales from sporting goods partners online retail stores that were operated for the entirety of both periods  million was due to an increase in sales through direct response television campaigns primarily from the sale of one of our partner s products and million was due to a net increase in bulk sales 
net revenues in fiscal and fiscal included million and million in shipping revenue  respectively 
cost of revenues 
we incurred cost of revenues from continuing operations of million for fiscal and million for fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  cost of revenues from continuing operations was for fiscal and for fiscal gross profit 
we had gross profit from continuing operations of million for fiscal and million for fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  gross profit from continuing operations was for fiscal and for fiscal the increase in gross profit dollars from fiscal to fiscal was due to the increase in net revenues and the increase in gross profit percentage was due primarily to an increase in service fee revenue from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and  to a lesser extent  volume and price discounts on merchandise purchased by us 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses from continuing operations decreased million from million for fiscal to million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in advertising costs  a million decrease in third party warehouse and fulfillment services costs  a million decrease in subsidized shipping and handling costs and a million decrease in professional fees  offset  in part  by a million increase in personnel  occupancy and other costs associated with our kentucky fulfillment center  a million increase in partner revenue share charges and a million increase in personnel costs associated with our merchandising  customer service and vendor operations departments 
product development expenses 
product development expenses from continuing operations increased million from million for fiscal to million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to a  increase in personnel costs  an  increase in equipment and software maintenance costs associated with the increased number of e commerce businesses that we operated and maintained and a  increase in communication costs  offset  in part  by a  decrease in costs relating to our use of professional consultants 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses from continuing operations increased million from million for fiscal to million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to a million increase in credit card chargeback activity due principally to increased sales volume and a million increase in insurance related expenses and other administrative costs to support our e commerce business  offset  in part  by a  decrease in personnel costs 
stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense from continuing operations increased million from million for fiscal to million for fiscal this increase was primarily the result of higher charges associated with the issuance of warrants to our partners and consultants and charges related to options subject to variable accounting 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million of deferred stock based compensation remaining to be amortized 
we had stock based compensation expense related to the amortization of deferred partner revenue share charges of  for fiscal and for fiscal depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million from million for fiscal to million for fiscal this decrease was due to a million decrease in depreciation expense related to the change in our estimate of the useful lives of our computer hardware and software from two years to four years 
this change in our estimate was based on management s then current analysis of our historical operating experience  which indicated that the original estimate was no longer appropriate 
this decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses was offset  in part  by a million increase in depreciation expense related to our corporate headquarters  our kentucky fulfillment center and the assets purchased to build  manage and operate our e commerce business and a  increase in amortization of goodwill associated with our acquisition of fogdog 
in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
under an impairment only approach  goodwill and certain intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead will be reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its fair value 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard and have not yet determined the effect of adoption on our financial position and results of operations 
interest income expense 
we had interest income of million and interest expense of  for fiscal compared to interest income of million and interest expense of  for fiscal the increase in interest income of million was due to higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments during fiscal the increase in interest expense of  was primarily due to increased interest incurred on the million mortgage note on our corporate headquarters which was entered into on april  twelve months of interest on this note was recorded in fiscal compared with eight months of interest in fiscal other income 
we had other income of  for fiscal and for fiscal  respectively 
this income related primarily to fees earned pursuant to the terms of a lease termination agreement 
we do not anticipate other income to be significant in fiscal income taxes 
since the sales of our discontinued operations  we have not generated taxable income 
net operating losses generated have been carried back to offset income taxes paid in prior years 
the remaining net operating losses will be carried forward 
the use of certain net operating loss carryforwards are subject to annual limitations based on ownership changes of our stock  as defined by section of the internal revenue code 
we expect that net operating losses of approximately million will expire before they can be utilized 
any otherwise recognizable deferred tax assets have been offset by a valuation allowance for the net operating loss carryforwards

the increase in sales and marketing expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily the result of increased personnel  fulfillment and marketing costs in fiscal due to the fact that we did not yet begin operating our partners e commerce businesses until the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  during the third quarter of fiscal  we incurred personnel  occupancy and other costs associated with our kentucky fulfillment center  as well as third party warehouse and fulfillment services costs

the terms of these sales are comparable to those given to our other partners  and the amount included in accounts receivable as a result of these sales was  and  as of december  and december   respectively 
critical accounting policies we have identified the following as critical accounting policies to us 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from product sales or services provided when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue from product sales  net of estimated returns based on historical experience  upon shipment of products to customers 
the majority of products are shipped from our fulfillment center located in louisville  ky 
we rely upon certain vendors to ship products to customers 
we act as principal in these transactions  as orders are initiated directly through the e commerce businesses that we operate  we take title to the goods during shipment and have the economic risk related to collection  customer service and returns 
we consider the criteria presented in emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining the appropriate revenue recognition treatment 
generally  when we are the primary obligor in a transaction  have general inventory risk  have established the selling price  have discretion in supplier selection  have physical loss inventory risk after customers order or during shipping and have credit risk  or have several but not all of these indicators  we record revenue gross as a principal 
we pay a percentage of the revenues generated from the sale of products through the e commerce businesses that we operate to our respective partners in exchange for the rights to use their brand names and the promotions and advertising that our partners agree to provide 
we refer to these royalty payments as partner revenue share charges 
we have considered the revenue reduction provisions addressed in eitf no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products  and believe that the payment of partner revenue share charges  or the issuance of warrants or stock in lieu of cash partner revenue share charges  to our partners does not result in any reduction of revenues 
eitf addresses consideration paid to parties along a distribution chain 
at our discretion  we purchase merchandise from our vendors and we are responsible for paying those vendors 
the amounts purchased and the prices paid to our vendors are not impacted by the revenue share provisions of our agreements with our partners 
accordingly  our partners and our vendors are not linked in the distribution chain and the provisions of eitf no 
do not apply 
we recognize revenue from services provided as the services are rendered 
if we receive payments for services in advance  these amounts are deferred and then recognized over the service period 
deferred revenue consists primarily of fees paid in advance to us as of the respective balance sheet date under an agreement to manage certain aspects of a partner s overall e commerce business  including fulfillment  technology and customer service 
deferred revenue also consists of amounts received from the sale of gift certificates redeemable on our partners web sites 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for stock options granted to employees under our qualified and nonqualified stock option plans using the intrinsic method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation cost for stock options issued to employees is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
we account for stock options and warrants issued to non employees using the fair value method prescribed in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and in accordance with the provisions of eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  and eitf no 
 accounting recognition for certain transactions involving equity instruments granted to other than employees 
accordingly  compensation cost for stock options and warrants issued to non employees is measured using a black scholes multiple option pricing model that takes into account assumptions as to the expected life of the option or warrant  the expected volatility of our common stock and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option or warrant 
we also record stock based compensation as deferred partner revenue share charges are amortized 
these deferred partner revenue share charges have resulted from the exercise of a right to receive  shares of our common stock in lieu of future cash revenue share payments  and were and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the deferred partner revenue share charges are being amortized as the revenue share expense is incurred based on actual revenues recognized in a given period and the imputed partner revenue share percentage  which is based on the value of the company s common stock that was issued upon exercise of the right 
accounting for internal use computer software and web site development costs we account for internal use computer software and web site development costs in accordance with the aicpa accounting standards executive committee s statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  and eitf  accounting for web site development costs 
accordingly  we generally capitalize costs incurred to develop internal use computer software during the application development stage  including those relating to developing our partners web sites 
we also capitalize costs of enhancements to internal use computer software  provided that these enhancements result in additional functionality 
we depreciate capitalized costs using the straight line method over their useful lives  which are based on management s estimate of the period that these capitalized costs will generate revenue 
during the first quarter of fiscal  management increased its estimate of the useful lives of these capitalized costs from two years to four years 
this change had the effect of decreasing the loss from continuing operations for fiscal by million  or per share 
this increase was based on management s then current analysis of our historical operating experience  which indicated that the original estimate was no longer appropriate 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents 
our cash and cash equivalents balance was million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
in connection with our decision to focus on our e commerce business in  we raised approximately million in gross proceeds through an equity financing with softbank in july we used part of the proceeds from this financing to repay the balance on our then outstanding lines of credit  reduce trade payables and provide operating capital related to our historical businesses 
we also used part of the proceeds to acquire property and equipment and fund the working capital needs of our e commerce business 
on april   we received million in gross proceeds through a mortgage financing of our corporate headquarters 
on april   we raised million in gross proceeds through an equity financing with softbank and rustic caynon 
on september   we raised million in gross proceeds and on october   we raised million in gross proceeds  through an equity financing with ith 
see company background section above 
we have used the proceeds of these financings for additional working capital needs and general business purposes 
on august   we raised million in gross proceeds through an equity financing with ith 
see company background section above 
we plan to use the proceeds of this financing for additional working capital needs and general business purposes 
we received an aggregate of million in proceeds from the sales of our discontinued operations in fiscal and fiscal  as well as million in net cash from the acquisition of fogdog in fiscal we have incurred substantial costs to develop our e commerce businesses and to recruit  train and compensate personnel for our creative  engineering  business development  marketing  merchandising  customer service  management information systems and administrative departments 
in addition  during fiscal  we invested in the required technology  equipment and personnel to make our kentucky fulfillment center fully operational  and we intend to purchase our kentucky fulfillment center in fiscal as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million and an accumulated deficit of million 
we used approximately million  million and million in net cash for operating activities of continuing operations during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
net cash used for operating activities of continuing operations during fiscal was primarily the result of net losses from continuing operations and changes in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other current assets  accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities  offset  in part  by changes in deferred revenue  inventory  stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization 
net cash used for operating activities of continuing operations during fiscal was primarily the result of net losses from continuing operations and changes in accounts receivable  inventory  prepaid expenses and other current assets  offset in part  by changes in refundable income taxes  deferred revenue  accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities  stock based compensation  and depreciation and amortization 
net cash used for operating activities of continuing operations during fiscal was primarily the result of net losses from continuing operations and changes in accounts receivable  inventory  prepaid expenses and other current assets  refundable income taxes and income taxes payable  offset  in part  by changes in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities  deferred revenue  stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization 
our investing activities during fiscal consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
we made capital expenditures of million during fiscal we expect capital expenditures for fiscal to be between million and million 
the actual capital expenditures that we make within that range will depend on a number of factors  including the completion of our intended acquisition of our kentucky fulfillment center  although we anticipate that a significant portion of the capital expenditure related to that purchase will be funded through the assumption of the mortgage on that facility 
also  during fiscal  we received  in cash proceeds from sales of short term investments 
during fiscal  our investing activities consisted of purchases of property and equipment 
we made capital expenditures of million during fiscal also  during fiscal  we received million in cash proceeds from the sale our off price and action sports division and million in net cash received from the acquisition of fogdog 
during fiscal  our investing activities consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
we made capital expenditures of million during fiscal also  during fiscal  we received million in cash proceeds from the sale of our branded division 
we had the following commitments as of december  concerning our debt obligations  lease obligations  employment agreements  advertising and media agreements  partner revenue share payment obligations and our anticipated payments associated with our acquisition of ashford 
com 
fiscal year thereafter total in thousands mortgage principal   mortgage interest   capital leases operating leases     employment agreements     advertising and media agreements partner revenue share payments        acquisition of ashfordcom   total commitments        to date  we have financed our e commerce operations primarily from the sale of equity securities 
management expects that our current cash and the collection of accounts receivable will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future 
in the fourth quarter of  we realized income from continuing operations of  and income from continuing operations  excluding non cash charges for stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization  of million 
those non cash charges aggregated million 
in addition  we expect that we will also realize income from continuing operations  excluding non cash charges for stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization  for fiscal however  in order to fund our anticipated operating expenses and realize income from continuing operations  including non cash charges  our revenues must increase significantly 
if cash flows are insufficient to fund these expenses  we may in the future need to raise additional funds in future periods through public or private debt or equity financings or other arrangements to fund our operations until we achieve profitability 
failure to raise future capital when needed could seriously harm our business and operating results 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be reduced 
furthermore  these equity securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock 
seasonality we expect to experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenues 
these seasonal patterns will cause quarterly fluctuations in our operating results 
in particular  we expect that the fourth fiscal quarter will account for a disproportionate percentage of our total annual sales 
we believe that results of operations for a quarterly period may not be indicative of the results for any other quarter or for the full year 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in institutional money market accounts  auction rate certificates and certificates of deposit 
in order to minimize risk and credit exposure  we invest with three financial institutions 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or it may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our long term debt consists of a mortgage note on our corporate headquarters 
the interest rate on the note is fixed at per annum over the ten year term of the note 
as of december   the mortgage note had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of million
