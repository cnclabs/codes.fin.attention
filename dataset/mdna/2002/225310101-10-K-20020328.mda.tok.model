the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to the reserve for advance losses  the allowance for credit losses  and the allowance for lease vehicle losses 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
north america and united kingdom operations reserve for advance losses 
the company maintains a reserve against advances that are not expected to be recovered through collections on the related automobile loan portfolio 
for purposes of establishing the reserve  the present value of estimated future collections for each dealer partner s loan portfolio is compared to the related advance balance 
the discount rate used for present value purposes is equal to the rate of return expected at the origination of the advance 
to the extent that the present value of future collections is less than the advance balance due from a dealer partner  the company records a reserve equal to the difference between the advance and the present value of the future collections 
the company maintains historical loss experience for each dealer partner on a static pool basis and uses this information to forecast the timing and amount of future collections on each dealer partner s portfolio 
proceeds from one dealer partner s portfolio cannot be used to offset losses relating to another dealer partner 
advance losses represent the company s primary credit risk 
the company has recorded two large provisions during its history  one in and the other in both charges related primarily to loan pools originated between and the first related to the initial loss assessment subsequent to the installation of the company s static pool loan information system in the second charge related to a reassessment of the loss based on the subsequent underperformance of these loan pools versus the company s initial assessment 
the risk of advance losses increases as the spread between the collection rate and advance rate narrows 
the company s primary protection against future losses relates to managing this spread appropriately 
allowance for credit losses 
the company maintains an allowance for credit losses that covers earned but unpaid servicing fees on automobile loan receivables in non accrual status 
servicing fees  which are booked as finance charges  are recognized under the interest method of accounting until the underlying obligation is days past due on a recency basis 
at such time  the company suspends the recognition of revenue and makes a provision for credit losses equal to the earned but unpaid finance charges 
once a loan is classified in non accrual status  it remains in non accrual status for the remaining life of the loan 
revenue on non accrual loans is recognized on a cash basis 
loans on which no payment has been received for nine months are written off 
ultimate losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision  which is a current expense  may be either greater or less than actual losses 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce materially different financial results 
automotive leasing operation allowance for lease vehicle losses 
the company maintains i a reserve for repossession losses  and ii a reserve for residual losses 
reserve for repossession losses 
the repossession reserve covers losses resulting from earned but unpaid revenue on leases transferred to non accrual status during the period and losses resulting from the sale of the vehicle after repossession 
leases are transferred to non accrual status once the lease is days past due on a recency basis 
at that time  the company suspends the recognition of lease revenue and makes a provision equal to the earned but unpaid revenue 
reserve for residual losses 
the residual reserve covers losses resulting from the disposal of vehicles at the end of the lease term 
the company establishes its residual values based upon an industry guidebook and the company s repossession experience 
realization of the residual values is dependent on the company s future ability to market the vehicles under then prevailing market conditions 
adverse changes in market conditions from those upon which the estimates were based could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to realize the values estimated and require an increase in the reserve  which may materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations 
ultimate losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision  which is a current expense  may be either greater or less than actual losses 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce materially different financial results

the company s principal need for capital has been to fund cash advances made to dealer partners in connection with the acceptance of automobile loans  for the payment of dealer holdbacks to dealer partners who have repaid their advance balances and to fund the origination of used vehicle leases 
when borrowing to fund the operations of its foreign subsidiaries  the company s policy is to borrow funds denominated in the currency of the country in which the subsidiary operates  thus mitigating the company s exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations

the company generates cash flow from operating activities as a result of net income  non cash charges deducted in computing net income and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
future cash flows from operating activities may be impacted by an agreement with the internal revenue service as the result of an examination of its tax years ended december   and this agreement requires changes in tax accounting methods with respect to the timing of revenue recognition 
the company has filed amended returns for the tax years ended december    and utilizing the new methods 
pursuant to the agreement and the filed amended returns  the company has recorded an additional current tax liability and a reduction to its deferred tax liability of million 
the agreement will also require the company to recognize interest income and interest expense for the years in question 
no interest amounts have been recorded  as the amounts and timing of such items cannot be determined at this time 
investing activities 
the company primarily required cash for the following investing activities i advances to dealer partners  ii payment of dealer holdbacks  and iii operating lease acquisitions 
these uses of cash have been funded by the principal collected on automobile loans and borrowings under the company s line of credit facilities 
the company s short and long term cash flow requirements are dependent on future levels of automobile loan originations 
in  the company experienced an increase in originations over the company expects this trend to continue in future periods and  to the extent this trend does continue  the company will experience an increase in its need for capital 
this trend in automobile loan originations is expected to be partially offset by a decline in operating lease originations based on management s decision to discontinue originating operating leases subsequent to december  financing activities 
net cash provided by used in financing activities primarily consist of i a bank line of credit facility  ii secured financings  iii senior notes  iv a mortgage note  and v repurchase and retirement of common stock  as further described below

the eurodollar borrowings may be fixed for periods of up to six months 
borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to a borrowing base limitation equal to of advances to dealer partners and leased vehicles as reflected in the consolidated financial statements and related notes  less a hedging reserve not exceeding  the amount of letters of credit issued under the line of credit  and the amount of other debt secured by the collateral which secures the line of credit 
the credit agreement has certain restrictive covenants  including a minimum required ratio of the company s assets to debt  its liabilities to tangible net worth  and its earnings before interest  taxes and non cash expenses to fixed charges 
additionally  the agreement requires that the company maintain a specified minimum level of net worth 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by a lien on most of the company s assets 
the company must pay an annual agent s fee and a quarterly commitment fee of on the amount of the commitment 
in addition  when outstanding borrowings under the commitment exceed of the amount of the commitment  the company must pay a quarterly fee equal to on the amount outstanding under the commitment

the proceeds of the secured financings were used by the company to reduce outstanding borrowings under the company s credit facility

such loans bear interest at a floating rate equal to the applicable commercial paper rate plus basis points with a maximum of and for the july  and november  secured financings  respectively 
as funding is organized as a separate legal entity from the company  assets of funding including the contributed dealer partner advances will not be available to satisfy the general obligations of the company  especially as substantially all the assets of funding have been encumbered to secure funding s obligations to its creditors 
in the first six months of the july and the first four months of the november financings  the company and funding received or may receive additional proceeds by having the company contribute additional dealer partner advances to funding which could then be used by funding as collateral to support additional borrowings 
to the extent permitted by its creditors  funding would be able to use the proceeds of such borrowings to pay the purchase price of such dealer partner advances or to make advances or distributions to the company 
such financings are secured by funding s dealer partner advances  funding s rights to collections on the related automobile loans receivable and certain related assets up to the sum of funding s dealer partner advances and the company s servicing fee
