critical accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in the summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgement 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in the summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has certain accounting policies which are described below 
form k page 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued merchandise inventory 
merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis  primarily on the retail method 
certain assumptions are made to assess that inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or market  based on historical experience and current information 
long lived assets 
the company has long lived assets which consist primarily of property and equipment 
the company estimates useful lives on buildings and equipment using assumptions based on historical data and industry trends 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets  the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flow of the related long lived assets is calculated and compared to the carrying value on the company s books 
management believes that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives are appropriate 
insurance reserves 
the company is self insured for certain losses relating to general liability  workers compensation  and employee medical benefit claims 
the company has purchased stop loss coverage in order to limit its exposure to significant claims 
accrued insurance liabilities are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
income taxes 
the company has generated deferred tax assets or liabilities due to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
the company has established a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company records income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations 
pension liabilities 
pension and other retirement benefits  including all relevant assumptions required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  are evaluated each year 
due to the technical nature of retirement accounting  outside actuaries are used to provide assistance in calculating the estimated future obligations 
since there are many estimates and assumptions involved in retirement benefits  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and assumptions could result in adjustments to pension expenses and obligations 
legal obligations 
in the normal course of business  the company must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities  which requires the use of management s judgement on the outcome of various issues 
management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process  however  the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than management s estimates  and adjustments to income could be required 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all the company s accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgement in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgement in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result
