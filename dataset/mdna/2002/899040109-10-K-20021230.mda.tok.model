critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america 
the reported financial results and disclosures were determined using significant accounting policies  practices and estimates as described below 
we believe the reported financial disclosures are reliable and present fairly  in all material respects  the financial position and results of the company 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation 
certain items in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation 
financial statement preparation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period 
differences from those estimates are recognized in the period they become known 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with revenue terms  typically revenues are recognized as sales when goods are shipped and title transfers to the customer 
trade accounts and notes receivable management estimates allowances for collectibility related to its trade accounts and note receivables 
these allowances are based on the customer relationships  the aging and turns of accounts receivable  credit worthiness of customers  credit concentrations and payment history 
although management monitors collections and credit worthiness  the inability of a particular customer to pay its debts could impact collectibility of receivables and could have an impact on future revenues if the customer is unable to arrange other financing 
management does not believe these conditions are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the collectibility of its receivables or future revenues 
management estimates sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits  and applies these trend rates to the most recent months sales data to calculate estimated reserves for future credits 
management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age  applying historical trend rates to the most recent months sales  less actual write offs to date 
management s estimates include providing for percent of specific customer balances when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectible 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
inventories inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in  first out fifo method of inventory evaluation 
the company estimates reserves for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage based on its judgment of future realization 
a large portion of the company s inventory is saleable to multiple customers and a portion of the inventory is manufactured to specifications provided by original equipment manufacturers and is not subject to rapid technological change 
management does not believe changes are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the valuation of its inventories
