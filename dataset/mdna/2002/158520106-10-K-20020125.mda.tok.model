the increase in cash and cash equivalents is primarily attributable to cash provided from operations including net cash flow from accounts receivable and inventory reductions of million and million 
the company has historically used cash generated from operating activities and debt to finance capital expenditures and the cash portion of the purchase price of acquisitions 
management plans to continue making significant investments in equipment and to seek appropriate acquisition candidates 
however  to fund the company s continued expansion of operations  additional financing may be necessary

dividends paid in  and were million per year 
inflation and economic conditions management believes that the effect of inflation on the company s operations has not been material and will continue to be immaterial for the foreseeable future 
the company does not have long term contracts  therefore  to the extent permitted by competition  it has the ability to pass through to its customers most cost increases resulting from inflation  if any 
in addition  the company is not particularly energy dependent  therefore  the increase in energy costs should not have a significant impact on the company 
seasonality historically  the company has experienced a greater portion of its annual sales and net income in the second and fourth quarters than in the first and third quarters 
the second quarter generally reflects increased orders for printing of corporate annual reports and proxy statements 
a post labor day increase in demand for printing services and office products coincides with the company s fourth quarter
