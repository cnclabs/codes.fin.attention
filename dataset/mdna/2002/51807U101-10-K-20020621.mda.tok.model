these forward looking statements speak only as of the date hereof 
the company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in the company s expectations with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any statement is critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
where appropriate  provision is made at that time for estimated warranty costs and estimated returns relating to product sales 
the company s us government subcontract requires delivery to a secure  government funded vault built on company premises 
deliveries are made into the vault on a fixed schedule specified by the prime contractor 
at the time the cards are delivered to the vault  title to the cards transfers to the government  the prime contractor is invoiced  and payment is due according to normal trade payment terms 
however  revenue is recognized when the cards are shipped from the vault to the government unless the company receives a fixed schedule  notification  or plan for shipments out of the vault to the government  in which case revenue would be recognized upon the latter of receipt of such fixed shipment schedule or delivery of the cards into the vault 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that management believes recovery is not likely  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that a valuation allowance is established or increased in a period  the company must include an expense within the tax provision in the statements of income 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance of million as of march   due to uncertainties related to the company s ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on management s estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which the company operates and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or that these estimates are adjusted in future periods  the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact the company s results of operations 
inventories 
the company values its inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the estimated forecast of product demand 
as demonstrated during fiscal  demand for read write drive products can fluctuate significantly 
if the company is unable to produce and sell read write drives in volume and at prices competitive with alternate technologies  its operating results could be harmed 
in order to obtain favorable pricing  purchases of read write drive parts are made in quantities that exceed the historical annual sales rate 
therefore  based upon last year s sales quantity  the company has more than one year s supply of read write drive parts on hand 
the company purchases read write drive parts for its anticipated read write drive demand and takes into consideration the order to delivery lead times of vendors and the economic purchase order quantity for such parts 
at march   read write drive parts and finished goods inventory totaled million compared with million at march  during fiscal  the company expects to purchase an additional  in read write drive parts necessary to complete the currently planned production of drives 
including approximately drives in finished goods inventory  approximately read write drives of the current design can be assembled from this parts inventory 
in addition  approximately  read write drives of a new design could be assembled with the additional purchase discussed above 
the company believes there is a market for basic and upgraded read write drives to support and expand optical card sales and  based on current proposals in process  that the read write drive inventory on hand at march   including parts to be received  will be ordered by customers 
if these anticipated orders do not materialize  the company may need to write down the value of its inventory for any potential excess quantities 
during fiscal  the company sold approximately read write drives 
the company believes that sales of approximately read write drives per quarter would be necessary to achieve a gross profit on read write drive sales at current selling prices and costs 
the company believes that the read write drive inventory as of march  is reflected at its net realizable value 
in addition  since lower cost read write drive designs may become available from the company before the existing parts are utilized  a portion of this inventory may be deemed obsolete and would require an inventory write down 
however  it is anticipated that the introduction of any new read write drive would be timed to minimize this risk 
in addition  the company is investing in research and engineering in an effort to develop new read write drive products  as discussed under research and engineering expenses 
restatement of results for fiscal and first nine months of fiscal in connection with the company s audit for the fiscal year ended march   the company and its newly appointed independent accountants conducted an internal review of revenue recognition practices that were being followed as they related to a government subcontract 
this review  as more fully described in the company s report on form k dated may   resulted in accounting adjustments arising from changes in the timing of revenue recognition of lasercard optical memory card shipments into and out of a secure  government funded vault built for the government on company premises to comply with security regulations under the subcontract 
in the past  the company recognized revenue upon deliveries to the vault since the customer takes title to the cards  assumes all risks of ownership  is obligated to remit payment for the cards at that time  and has no rights of return except for product defects 
however  drexler s newly appointed independent accountants advised the company that under the terms and conditions of the company s us government supply subcontract  the transfer of title and the imminent cash payment pursuant to the contract payment terms upon delivery of the cards to the vault are necessary but not necessarily sufficient to recognize revenue upon delivery of cards to the vault  under the sec s staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition  and under the prior criteria set forth in the sec s accounting and auditing enforcement release no 
in the restated financial statements  revenue is recognized upon shipment of cards from the vault to the customer since the company had not been provided with a fixed schedule  notification  or plan for shipments out of the vault to the government 
the company has restated previously issued results for fiscal years through and the first nine months of fiscal to reflect these adjustments in the timing of revenue recognition 
as a result of the restatement  revenue for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal declined  while revenue for fiscal and the first nine months of fiscal increased 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal and fiscal revenues for the fiscal year ended march   the company s total revenues were  compared with  for fiscal and  for fiscal product revenues 
sales of lasercard r optical memory cards and related products totaled  for fiscal compared with  for fiscal and  for fiscal the changes in product revenues over these periods were due primarily to the sale of optical memory cards for two us government card programs  as described below 
for fiscal  the company sold lasercard products or provided services to approximately customers in seven states and foreign countries 
the company s card deliveries to all customers totaled million optical memory cards and read write drives for fiscal compared with million optical cards and  read write drives for fiscal and million cards and read write drives for fiscal read write drive revenues decreased by million for fiscal compared with fiscal and increased by approximately million in fiscal as compared with fiscal of the  read write drives sold during fiscal  approximately drives were delivered mainly for the us department of defense automated manifest system as compared with approximately read write drives for fiscal and approximately drives for fiscal orders for this program have historically been sporadic 
the remaining decrease in read write drive deliveries was due to a reduction in sales to visx  incorporated  discussed below 
the company s principal lasercard market today involves high security  counterfeit resistant  tamper resistant cards for digital governance  defined as the utilization of digital information technology by a nation  state  region  municipality  agency  or institution 
within this market  the company s largest customer for lasercard products is the united states government  representing of total revenues for fiscal year compared with of total revenues for fiscal and of total revenues for fiscal these revenues are predominantly the result of two card programs us immigration and naturalization service ins permanent resident cards green cards and us department of state dos border crossing cards laser visas 
visx  incorporated  a non government customer since  represented of the company s fiscal revenues 
although some of visx s lasercard equipped surgery systems continued to use the company s optical memory cards in fiscal  visx does not employ lasercard drives for system activation of its currently produced laser eye surgery equipment 
this had an adverse effect on the company s revenue levels in fiscal and optical memory card digital governance programs that appear to be emerging in other countries include an electronic national identification card social services card in italy  building construction permit cards and children s healthcare cards in china  and state government motor vehicle registration cards in india 
the company believes that market opportunities for optical memory cards also appear to include identification cards for saudi arabia and macedonia  a document card program in mexico  and resident immigrant cards for canada  as well as an expansion of current us government id card programs 
in addition  the company is continuing its efforts to develop new optical card read write drives and read only drives and software products 
in addition to using its own marketing staff  the company utilizes value added reseller var companies and card distribution licensees for the development of commercial markets and applications for lasercard products 
product sales to vars and licensees include the company s optical memory cards  the company s system software  optical card read write drives  and add on peripherals made by other companies such as equipment for adding a digitized photo  fingerprint  hand template  or signature to the cards 
the vars licensees may add application software  personal computers pcs  and other peripherals  and then resell these products integrated into data systems 
the company is continuing its efforts to recruit new vars and card distribution licensees and eliminate nonproductive vars 
the company provides customer technical support and system software to assist vars and licensees 
license fee revenues 
fiscal license revenue included  realized from the sale of a license in italy to assemble optical card reader writers using parts kits supplied by the company 
fiscal license revenue included  from the italian read write drive assembly license and  realized from the sale of a digital sound patent license 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal license revenue included  recognized on digital sound patent licenses and  realized from the italian read write drive assembly license 
backlog as of march   the backlog for lasercard optical memory cards totaled approximately million  consisting of approximately million in firm card orders under card supply contracts  and approximately million in cards produced and delivered to a secure  government funded vault 
of the million amount  is for us government green cards or laser visas under a us government subcontract for the purchase of optical memory cards 
of the million amount  all are green cards or laser visas produced under this subcontract 
as of march   the backlog for lasercard optical memory cards totaled approximately million  consisting of approximately million in firm card orders under card supply contracts  and approximately million in cards produced and delivered to a secure  government funded vault 
announced in june  the company s us government subcontract has an authorized maximum of million for up to million cards  at an average selling price of about per card  over a period of up to five years 
the subcontract was received by the company through a lasercard var that is a us government prime contractor  under a competitively bid  government procurement contract 
the subcontract states that the us government anticipates placing orders in units of at least one million optical memory cards per order 
the subcontract provides for an initial one year contract period and four additional one year contract options 
deliveries commenced in september  and million cards have been delivered to the vault as of march   under this subcontract 
the company s us government subcontract requires delivery to a secure  government funded vault built on company premises 
deliveries are made into the vault on a fixed schedule specified by the prime contractor 
at the time the cards are delivered to the vault  title to the cards transfers to the government  the prime contractor is invoiced  and payment is due according to normal trade payment terms 
however  revenue is recognized when the cards are shipped from the vault to the government unless the company receives a fixed schedule  notification  or plan for shipments out of the vault to the government  in which case revenue would be recognized upon the latter of receipt of such fixed shipment schedule or delivery of the cards into the vault 
as of march   the vault contained million cards with a sales value of million 
the million in sales value will be recorded as revenue and the associated costs will be recorded in cost of sales when the cards are shipped unless the company receives a fixed schedule  notification  or plan for shipments out of the vault to the government  in which case revenue would be recognized upon receipt of such fixed delivery schedule 
the million cards are owned by the us government and are not included in inventory on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the net of the revenue value of million and the million cost is recorded as deferred gross profit in the amount of million on the consolidated balance sheets 
gross profit the gross margin on product sales was for fiscal and fiscal  and for fiscal optical memory cards 
the company continues to depend on gross profit generated from optical memory card sales 
gross profit on optical memory card sales was about million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal the decrease in gross profit for fiscal was mainly due to lower sales volume 
optical memory card gross profit and margins can vary based on average selling price  sales and production volume  mix of card types  production efficiency and yields  and changes in fixed costs 
read write drives 
for fiscal  gross profit on read write drive sales decreased by about million  to a negative gross profit of about  compared with a gross profit of about  for fiscal and  for fiscal the decrease for fiscal was due to lower selling prices for drives and lower sales volume to a level that does not fully absorb fixed manufacturing expenditures 
in fiscal  the company reduced the selling prices of its basic read write drives by for typical sales quantities  in an effort to increase certain markets for optical memory cards 
this reduced gross profit on read write drive sales in fiscal  and increased the level of sales required to achieve gross profits on read write drive sales 
currently  the company s priority is to increase the number of read write drives in the marketplace rather than maximizing per unit gross profit on read write drives 
the company has no plans to further lower read write drive prices for the current model 
the company believes that potential markets for read write drives include the us immigration and naturalization service  us department of state  the us armed forces  canada  italy  and several other countries 
the company maintains an inventory of read write drive parts and finished drives that it believes is adequate to meet customer demand 
however  an interruption in the supply of read write drive parts or difficulties encountered in read write drive assembly could cause a delay in deliveries of drives and optical memory cards and a possible loss of sales  which would adversely affect the company s operating results 
income and expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a 
sg a expenses were  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal the increase for fiscal compared with fiscal included approximately  for increased marketing and selling expenditures  an increase of  in general and administrative expenditures  and an increase of  in company k matching and company contribution to the employee stock purchase plan 
the  increase in fiscal compared with fiscal was due to an increase in general corporate compensation expense of  a  expense for company k matching  a  increase in general expenses including insurance  partially offset by a  decrease in bad debt expense  a  decrease in patent amortization expense  and a  expenditure in fiscal for a third party market study 
the company believes that sg a expenses for fiscal will remain above fiscal levels  mainly due to increases in marketing expenses and other general increases 
research and engineering expenses r e 
the company is continuing its efforts to develop new optical memory card read write drives and read only drives and software products in order to provide new products that can stimulate sales growth 
the company anticipates that these r e efforts will result in lower cost drives  customer optimized drive systems  and drive systems with advanced security features 
r e expenses were  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal the increase in r e spending for fiscal was due to the increase in read write and read only drive manufacturing engineering and product development 
the increase in r e spending for fiscal is due to read write drive manufacturing engineering and product development 
the company anticipates that r e expenses will continue to increase during fiscal  primarily due to optical memory card read write drive development efforts 
other income 
total other income for fiscal consisted of  of interest income compared with  of interest income for fiscal and total net other income of  for fiscal the difference for fiscal compared with fiscal is due to interest rate declines 
the difference for fiscal compared with fiscal is due to a greater amount of invested funds 
there was no interest expense for fiscal or and  in interest expense for fiscal pretax profit 
pretax profit for fiscal decreased by million compared with fiscal due to the million reduction in product gross profit  a million increase in expenses  and a million decrease in license revenue 
pretax profits for fiscal increased by million compared with fiscal due to the million increase in product gross profit and the million increase in license revenue  partially offset by a million increase in expenses 
income taxes 
the company recorded an income tax benefit of  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal as of march   the company has recognized all prior tax benefits for income statement purposes 
any release of the remaining valuation allowance would be recorded as a credit to equity and would have no impact on net income 
the income tax benefit for fiscal included a credit of  due to the change in the federal deferred tax asset  net of federal alternative minimum taxes  partially offset by  for state tax expense the income tax benefit for fiscal included a credit of  due to the change in the federal deferred tax asset  net of federal alternative minimum taxes  partially offset by  for state tax expense and  for foreign income taxes 
the income tax benefit for fiscal included a credit of  due to the change in deferred tax asset  net of federal taxes  partially offset by  for state tax expense 
the company analyzes its deferred tax assets with regard to potential realization 
the company has established a valuation allowance on a significant portion of the deferred tax assets based upon the uncertainty of their realization 
the company has considered estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
there are timing differences between when certain items are included in book income and when the same items are included on income tax returns 
therefore  tax payments or credits often occur in different periods than when an income tax expense or benefit is included in the statements of income 
for income tax purposes  the company estimates that as these timing differences are realized on the tax return  future federal tax cash payments could be reduced by approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   the company had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of  a current ratio of to  and no long term debt 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal the major categories comprising cash provided by operating activities are in thousands fiscal year earnings before taxes  depreciation  and amortization    increase decrease in deferred gross profit  tax payments increase in inventory  increase in advance payments from customers and deferred revenue   other cash provided by operating activities    the company believes that the estimated level of revenues over the next months will be sufficient to generate cash from operations over the next months 
operating cash flow could be negatively impacted to a significant degree if both of the company s largest us government programs were to be delayed  canceled  or not extended and not be replaced by other card orders or other sources of income  or if increases in product revenues or licenses do not keep pace with increased marketing and r e expenditures 
the company has not established a line of credit and has no current plans to do so 
the company may negotiate a line of credit if and when it becomes appropriate  although no assurance can be made that such financing would be available on favorable terms or at all  if needed 
as a result of the  net income recorded for fiscal  the company s accumulated deficit was reduced to  stockholders equity increased to  as a result of the net income recorded and  in additions to equity  mainly due to stock option exercises 
net cash used for investing activities was  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal these amounts include changes in the maturity of liquid investments  purchases of property and equipment of  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal  and increases in patents and other intangibles of  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal the company considers all highly liquid investments  consisting primarily of commercial paper  taxable notes  and us government bonds  with original maturities of three months or less  to be cash equivalents 
all investments with original maturities of more than three months but not more than one year  are classified as short term investments 
management determines the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the classification of investments as of each balance sheet date 
as of march   the company had  classified as short term investments  compared with  at march  all marketable securities were classified as held to maturity 
cash plus short term investments were  at march  and  at march  for optical memory card production  the company added capital equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately million during fiscal compared with approximately million during fiscal and million during fiscal depending on card type  the company s card production capacity is approximately to million cards per year and is expected to reach a capacity of approximately million cards per year by may  the company plans to purchase additional production equipment in a series of steps as optical memory card orders expand to justify production capacity increases  to a rate of up to million cards per year 
in addition to investment used for expansion  the company expects to make additional capital expenditures for cost savings  quality improvements  and other purposes 
the company believes that during the next few years  capital expenditures could be a minimum of million per year for card production equipment and automatic inspection equipment to support growth of optical memory card production 
on december   the company announced that it raised optical memory card shipment estimates to to million cards for fiscal year  which began on april   compared to million cards shipped for fiscal in connection with read write drive manufacturing and design  the company added capital equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately  during fiscal compared with  during fiscal and  during fiscal the company expects that additional capital investments of  to  will be made during the remainder of fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was  for fiscal and  for fiscal compared with  used for financing activities for fiscal financing activities consisted of proceeds on sales of common stock through the company s stock option and stock purchase plans and cash used for purchases of common stock under a stock repurchase program  discussed below 
sales of common stock through stock plans were in the amounts of  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal during fiscal  the company commenced a share repurchase program under which up to  shares of common stock could be purchased by the company from time to time in nasdaq stock market transactions in an aggregate amount not exceeding million 
during fiscal  the company used cash of  for this purpose versus  used in fiscal as of june   the company had completed this program 
there were no debt financing activities for fiscal   or item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company invests its cash  beyond that needed for daily operations  in high quality debt securities 
in doing so  the company seeks primarily to preserve the value and liquidity of its capital and  secondarily  to safely earn income from these investments 
to accomplish these goals  the company invests only in debt securities issued by a the us treasury and us government agencies and corporations and b debt instruments that meet the following criteria o commercial paper rated a p or debt instruments rated aaa  as rated by the major rating services o can readily be sold for cash foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company sells products in various international markets 
all of these sales are contracted and paid for in us dollars 
as of march   the company had no outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts 
accordingly  the company had no material foreign currency exchange risk as of march  during fiscal  there were no material changes to the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
