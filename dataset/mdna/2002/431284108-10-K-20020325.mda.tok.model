these investments are initially recorded at cost  as investments in unconsolidated affiliates  and are subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions

the following table sets forth the changes in the company s cash flows from to in thousands year ended december  change cash provided by operating activities    cash used in provided by investing activities    cash used in financing activities    the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of our capital recycling program and a decrease in average occupancy rates for our wholly owned portfolio 
real estate taxes were higher in primarily due to higher property assessments 
the level of net cash provided by operating activities is also affected by the timing of receipt of revenues and payment of expenses

we currently have a million unsecured revolving loan with million outstanding at december  that matures in december and a million secured revolving loan with million outstanding at december  that matures in march our unsecured revolving loan also includes a million competitive sub facility 
depending upon the corporate credit ratings assigned to us from time to time by the various rating agencies  our unsecured revolving loan bears variable rate interest at a spread above libor ranging from to and our secured revolving loan bears variable rate interest at a spread above libor ranging from to 
we currently have a credit rating of bbb assigned by standard poor s  a credit rating of bbb assigned by fitch inc and a credit rating of baa assigned by moody s investor service 
as a result  interest currently accrues on borrowings under our unsecured revolving loan at an average rate of libor plus basis points and under our secured revolving loan at an average rate of libor plus basis points 
in addition  we are currently required to pay an annual facility fee equal to 
of the total commitment under the unsecured revolving loan 
the terms of each of our revolving loans and the indenture that governs our outstanding notes require us to comply with various operating and financial covenants and performance ratios 
we are currently in compliance with all such requirements 
in addition  based on our current expectation of future operating performance  we expect to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future 
joint ventures 
during the past several years  we have formed various joint ventures with unrelated investors 
we have retained minority equity interests ranging from to in these joint ventures 
as required by gaap  we have accounted for our joint venture activity using the equity method of accounting  as we do not control these joint ventures 
as a result  the assets and liabilities of our joint ventures are not included on our balance sheet 
our joint ventures have approximately million of outstanding debt 
all of the joint venture debt is nonrecourse to the company except in the case of customary exceptions pertaining to such matters as misuse of funds  environmental conditions and material misrepresentations and with respect to million of construction debt related to the mg hiw rocky point  llc  which has been initially guaranteed in part by the company subject to a pro rata indemnity from the company s joint venture partner 
the company s guarantee of the mg hiw rocky point  llc debt represented of the outstanding loan balance at december  and will decrease to in the first quarter of interest rate hedging activities 
to meet in part our long term liquidity requirements  we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates 
borrowings under our two revolving loans bear interest at variable rates 
our long term debt  which consists of long term financings and the unsecured issuance of debt securities  typically bears interest at fixed rates 
in addition  we have assumed fixed rate and variable rate debt in connection with acquiring properties 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  from time to time we enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars  swaps  caps and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments 
we do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
the following table sets forth information regarding our interest rate hedge contract as of december  in thousands notional maturity fixed fair market type of hedge amount date reference rate rate value swap  month libor the interest rate on all of our variable rate debt is adjusted at one and three month intervals  subject to settlements under these contracts 
we also enter into treasury lock agreements from time to time in order to limit our exposure to an increase in interest rates with respect to future debt offerings 
net payments to counterparties under interest rate hedge contracts were million during and were recorded as additional interest expense 
current and future cash needs 
historically  rental revenue has been the principal source of funds to meet our short term liquidity requirements  which primarily consist of operating expenses  debt service  stockholder distributions and ordinary course capital expenditures 
in addition  construction management  maintenance  leasing and management fees have provided sources of cash flow 
we presently have no plans for major capital improvements to the existing properties  other than normal recurring building improvements  tenant improvements and lease commissions 
in addition to the requirements discussed above  our short term within the next months liquidity requirements also include the funding of approximately million of our existing development activity 
see business development activity 
we expect to fund our short term liquidity requirements through a combination of working capital  cash flows from operations and the following 
borrowings under our unsecured revolving loan up to million of availability  as of march   
borrowings under our secured revolving loan up to million of availability  as of march   
the selective disposition of non core assets  
the sale or contribution of some of our wholly owned properties  development projects and development land to strategic joint ventures to be formed with unrelated investors  which will have the net effect of generating additional capital through such sale or contributions  and 
the issuance of secured debt at december   we had billion of unencumbered real estate assets at cost 
our long term liquidity needs generally include the funding of existing and future development activity  selective asset acquisitions and the retirement of mortgage debt  amounts outstanding under the two revolving loans and long term unsecured debt 
we remain committed to maintaining a flexible capital structure 
accordingly  we expect to meet our long term liquidity needs through a combination of the issuance by the operating partnership of additional unsecured debt securities  the issuance of additional equity securities by the company and the operating partnership as well as the sources described above with respect to our short term liquidity 
we expect to use such sources to meet our long term liquidity requirements either through direct payments or repayment of borrowings under the unsecured revolving loan 
we do not intend to reserve funds to retire existing secured or unsecured indebtedness upon maturity 
instead  we will seek to refinance such debt at maturity or retire such debt through the issuance of equity or debt securities 
we anticipate that our available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operating activities  with cash available from borrowings and other sources  will be adequate to meet our capital and liquidity in both the short and long term 
however  if these sources of funds are insufficient or unavailable  the company s ability to make the expected distributions to stockholders discussed below and satisfy other cash payments may be adversely affected 
distributions to stockholders 
to maintain qualification as a reit  the company must distribute to stockholders at least of reit taxable income 
in accordance with the tax relief extension act  the distribution requirement was reduced to beginning in the company expects to use its cash flow from operating activities for distributions to stockholders and for payment of recurring  non incremental revenuegenerating expenditures 
the following factors will affect cash flows from operating activities and  accordingly  influence the decisions of the board of directors regarding distributions debt service requirements after taking into account the repayment and restructuring of certain indebtedness  scheduled increases in base rents of existing leases  changes in rents attributable to the renewal of existing leases or replacement leases  changes in occupancy rates at existing properties and procurement of leases for newly acquired or developed properties  and operating expenses and capital replacement needs 
share and unit repurchase program 
on april   we announced that the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million shares of common stock and common units 
as of february   the company had repurchased million shares of common stock and common units at a weighted average purchase price of per share and a total purchase price of million under this new repurchase program 
in determining whether or not to repurchase additional capital stock  we will consider  among other factors  the effect of repurchases on our liquidity and the price of our common stock 
on june   the company repurchased in a privately negotiated transaction  series a preferred shares at per share  for a total purchase price of million 
for each series a preferred share repurchased by the company  one equivalent series a preferred unit in the operating partnership was retired 
disposition activity 
as part of our ongoing capital recycling program  since december  through february   we have sold  square feet of office properties and acres of development land for gross proceeds of million 
in addition  at february   we had  square feet of office properties and acres of land under contract for sale in various transactions totaling million 
these transactions are subject to customary closing conditions  including due diligence and documentation  and are expected to close during the first and second quarters of however  we can provide no assurance that all or parts of these transactions will be consummated 
when properties are identified as held for sale  we discontinue depreciation and estimate the net proceeds expected from the disposition of such properties 
if  in our opinion  the net sales price of the properties that have been identified for sale is less than the net book value of the properties  a valuation allowance is established 
additionally  on a periodic basis  we assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate properties may be impaired 
a property s value is impaired only if our estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property are less than the carrying value of the property 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property 
we do not believe that the value of any of our rental properties is impaired 
impact of recently issued accounting standards on june   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
apply to all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
becomes effective beginning january  we do not anticipate that these standards will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
this standard harmonizes the accounting for impaired assets and resolves some of the implementation issues as originally described in sfas no 
the new standard becomes effective for the year ending december  we do not expect this pronouncement to have a material impact on our liquidity  financial position or results of operations 
funds from operations and cash available for distributions we consider funds from operations ffo to be a useful financial performance measure of the operating performance of an equity reit because  together with net income and cash flows  ffo provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of a reit to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures 
ffo does not represent net income or cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
it should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all cash needs  including principal amortization  capital improvements and distributions to stockholders 
further  ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation of ffo  as described below 
ffo and cash available for distributions should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
ffo equals net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non real estate assets are not added back to net income in arriving at ffo 
in addition  ffo includes both recurring and non recurring operating results 
as a result  non recurring items that are not defined as extraordinary under gaap are reflected in the calculation of ffo 
gains and losses from the sale of depreciable operating property are excluded from the calculation of ffo 
cash available for distribution is defined as funds from operations reduced by non revenue enhancing capital expenditures for building improvements and tenant improvements and lease commissions related to second generation space 
ffo and cash available for distribution for the years ended december   and are summarized in the following table in thousands year ended december ffo income before minority interest and extraordinary item    add deduct dividends to preferred shareholders    transition loss upon adoption of fas cost of unsuccessful transactions  severance costs and other division closing expenses  gain on disposition of land and depreciable assets    gain on disposition of land   depreciation and amortization    depreciation on unconsolidated subsidiaries    ffo    cash available for distribution add deduct rental income from straight line rents    amortization of deferred financing costs    non incremental revenue generating capital expenditures building improvements paid    second generation tenant improvements paid    second generation lease commissions paid    cash available for distribution    weighted average shares units outstanding basic    weighted average shares units outstanding diluted    dividend payout ratios ffo cash available for distribution amounts represent cash expenditures 
assumes redemption of common units for shares of common stock 
minority interest common unit holders and the stockholders of the company share equally on a per common unit and per share basis  therefore  the per share information is unaffected by conversion 
inflation in the last five years  inflation has not had a significant impact on us because of the relatively low inflation rate in our geographic areas of operation 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their share of increases in operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing our exposure to inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the effects of potential changes in interest rates are discussed below 
our market risk discussion includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates 
these disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses  but only indicators of reasonably possible losses 
as a result  actual future results may differ materially from those presented 
see management s discussion and analysis of results of operations liquidity and capital resources and the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 
to meet in part our long term liquidity requirements  we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates 
borrowings under our two revolving loans bear interest at variable rates 
our long term debt  which consists of secured and unsecured long term financings and the issuance of unsecured debt securities  typically bears interest at fixed rates 
in addition  we have assumed fixed rate and variable rate debt in connection with acquiring properties 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  from time to time we enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars  swaps  caps and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments 
we do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
variable rate debt 
as of december   the company had approximately million of variable rate debt outstanding that was not protected by interest rate hedge contracts 
if the weighted average interest rate on this variable rate debt is basis points higher or lower during the months ended december   our interest expense would be increased or decreased approximately million 
interest rate hedge contract 
for a discussion of our interest rate hedge contract in effect at december   see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capitalization 
if interest rates increase by basis points  the aggregate fair market value of this interest rate hedge contract as of december  would increase by approximately  if interest rates decrease by basis points  the aggregate fair market value of this interest rate hedge contract as of december  would decrease by approximately in addition  we are exposed to certain losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty under the hedge contract 
we expect the counterparty  which is a major financial institution  to perform fully under this contract 
however  if the counterparty was to default on its obligation under the interest rate hedge contract  we could be required to pay the full rates on our debt  even if such rates were in excess of the rate in the contract
