also our company management may make forward looking statements orally to investors  analysts the media and others 
forward looking statements express our expectations or predictions of future events or results 
they are not guarantees and are subject to many risks and uncertainties 
there are a number of factors many beyond our control they could cause actual events or results to be significantly different from those described in the forward looking statement 
any or all of our forward looking statements in this report or in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong 
forward looking statements might include one or more of the following projections of future revenue  anticipated clinical trial commencement dates  completion timelines or results  descriptions of plans or objectives of management for future operations  products or services  forecasts of future economic performance  and descriptions or assumptions underlying or relating to any of the above items 
forward looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
they use words such as anticipate  estimate  expect  project  intend  plan  believe or words of similar meaning 
they may also use words such as will  would  should  could or may 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially include the risks discussed below  as well as in the risk factors section included in our registration statement on form s file no 
as filed with the securities and exchange commission on february  we are incorporating these risk factors by reference 
you should read them 
you should also read the risk factors listed from time to time in our reports on form q  s  s or k and amendments  if any  to these reports 
viragen will provide you with any copy of any or all of these reports at no charge 
among the uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from our projections are whether the efficacy  price and timing of our human leukocyte interferon will enable us to compete with other well established  highly capitalized  biopharmaceutical companies  whether our patent applications result in the issuance of patents  or whether patents and other intellectual property rights provide adequate protections in the event of misappropriation or infringement by third parties  whether clinical testing confirms the efficacy of our product  and results in the receipt of regulatory approvals  whether we are able to secure sufficient funding to complete product development  including clinical trials  and successfully market our product  whether we can generate revenue sufficient to offset our historical losses  or achieve profitability  whether we can continue to integrate viranative s operations successfully  and whether  despite receipt of regulatory approvals  our products are accepted as a treatment superior to that of our competitors 
our natural interferon product was developed and is being manufactured overseas 
our dependence on foreign manufacturing and expected international sales exposes us to a number of risks  including transportation delays and interruptions  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  currency exchange risks  tariffs and other trade barriers  including import and export restrictions  political or economic instability  compliance with foreign laws  difficulties in protecting intellectual property rights in foreign countries  and exchange controls 
viragen has incurred operational losses and operated with negative cash flows since its inception in december net losses have totaled   and  for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  depreciation  amortization  asset valuation allowances  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
consolidation 
our consolidated financial statements include the results of viragen international and all of its subsidiaries  including those operating outside the united states 
all significant transactions among our businesses have been eliminated 
assets and liabilities are translated into united states dollars using foreign exchange rates as of the balance sheet date 
we translate the revenue and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries using average semi monthly foreign exchange rates 
translation adjustments are included in the balance sheet under accumulated other comprehensive loss  a separate component of stockholders equity 
inventories 
inventories consist of raw materials and supplies  work in process and finished products 
finished products consist of bulk and purified leukocyte interferon 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market estimated net realizable value 
raw materials and supplies cost is determined on a first in  first out basis 
work in process and finished goods costs consisting of materials  labor and overhead are recorded at a standard cost which approximates actual cost 
if the cost of the inventories exceeds their expected market value  provisions are recorded currently for the difference between the cost and the market value 
these provisions are determined based on estimates 
long lived assets 
we routinely evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets 
if events and circumstances indicate that assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets  we would record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations 
if impairment exists  the charge to operations would be measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
stock based compensation 
our employee stock option plans are accounted for under accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
we grant stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant 
in accordance with apb  we recognize no compensation expense for these stock option grants 
we account for our stock based compensation arrangements with non employees in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and related guidance  including emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
accordingly  we recognize as expense the estimated fair value of such instruments as calculated using the black scholes valuation model 
the estimated fair value is re determined each quarter using the methodologies allowable by sfas no 
and eitf no 
and the expense is amortized over the vesting period of each option or the recipient s contractual arrangement  if shorter 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales when title and risk of loss has been transferred  which is generally upon shipment 
moreover  recognition requires persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
research and development costs 
research and development expenses include scientific salaries and support fees  laboratory supplies  consulting fees  research related travel  equipment rentals and repairs and maintenance  and utilities 
all such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
litigation and other contingencies 
we monitor the status of our litigation  if any  and other contingencies for purposes of loss accrual 
if we believed a loss to be probable and reasonably estimated  as required by sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we would establish an appropriate accrual 
we would base our accruals on information available at the time of such determination 
information may become available to us after that time  for which additional accruals may be required 
liquidity and capital resources the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents and working capital are not sufficient to meet its operating requirements through the end of fiscal the company s operating losses and working capital requirements continue to adversely affect cash flow 
in the event of our inability to raise capital  or a lack of expanded revenue from the sale of our natural interferon product  the company will likely be unable to meet its operating requirements through the end of fiscal in this event we would be required to significantly curtail or suspend our operations 
as a result of these financial conditions  the report of our independent certified public accountants on our june  consolidated financial statements includes an explanatory paragraph indicating that these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
as of june   viragen had on hand approximately  in cash 
as of june   we had a working capital deficit of approximately  compared to working capital of approximately  as of june  the decrease in working capital of approximately  compared to the previous fiscal year end balance was due primarily to the use of cash to fund operating activities totaling approximately  and cash used to purchase equipment and pay expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of viranative totaling approximately  these amounts were partially offset by  raised through private equity placements including the issuance of common stock and convertible debentures 
we intend to continue financing our operations for the foreseeable future from cash on hand and additional private investment placements 
our future capital requirements are dependent upon many factors  including revenue generated from the sale of our natural interferon product  progress with future and ongoing clinical trials  the costs associated with obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in patent applications  competing technologies and market developments  and our ability to establish collaborative arrangements and effective commercialization activities 
in december  we retained the investment banking firm of ladenburg thalmann co  inc to aid us in raising up to million in additional investment capital  on a best effort basis 
in march  the securities and exchange commission declared our related shelf registration on form s file no 
effective 
through december   the date of expiration of this agreement  we had raised approximately million in additional capital  net of fees 
included in this total was a million investment by active investors ltd 
ii  an investment fund controlled by fundamental management corporation 
carl n 
singer  a director of both viragen and viragen international  serves as chairman of fundamental management corporation 
from january through our fiscal year end  we raised an additional million through the issuance of approximately million shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock to a series of institutional investors 
the warrants carry a term of years and are exercisable at prices ranging from to per share 
on january   viragen entered into a securities purchase agreement with elliott international  lp and elliott associates  lp elliott 
under the terms of this agreement  we issued two convertible debentures for a total principal amount of  the debentures bear interest at a rate of per annum 
in connection with this transaction  viragen paid  for placement fees and expenses 
possible shares to be issued under this agreement are registered under the form s registration statement file no 
filed with the securities and exchange commission  which was declared effective on february  principal and interest on the debentures are payable monthly  commencing april   in shares of common stock or in cash with a premium at our option 
the debentures are currently convertible into shares of common stock at a price equal to the lesser of or of the arithmetic mean of the ten lowest volume weighted average prices during the twenty days preceding conversion 
the is subject to adjustment in the event of stock dividends  splits or the issuance of additional common stock at less then the conversion price or fair market value on the date of issuance based on a mathematical calculation 
additional reductions in the conversion price are possible 
the debentures may be prepaid at our discretion with a premium on amounts then due 
under the securities purchase agreement  elliott also received warrants to purchase a total of  shares of viragen common stock 
the warrants are currently exercisable at per share through january  the exercise price of these warrants is subject to adjustment in the event of stock dividends  mergers  certain distributions of common stock or issuance of common stock at less than the exercise price of the warrants on the date of issuance and less than the fair value of common stock at date of issuance  based on a mathematical calculation 
additional reductions in the exercise price of these warrants are possible 
under the securities purchase agreement  elliott also has the option to purchase an additional  shares at a purchase price of per share from may  through november   which may be exercised on a cashless basis 
the purchase price per share is subject to adjustment in the event of stock dividends  mergers  certain distributions of common stock or issuance of common stock at less than the purchase price of the option on the date of issuance and less than the fair value of common stock at date of issuance  based on a mathematical calculation 
additional reductions in the purchase price are possible 
on april   we issued  shares of our common stock as payment of the first monthly principal installment on the debentures plus interest accrued to date 
the number of shares was based on a conversion price of approximately  which represented ninety percent of the average of the ten lowest volume weighted average prices of our common stock during the twenty trading days immediately preceding the conversion date 
subsequent to the april  installment  we have made cash payments totaling approximately million  which represented the may through september monthly principal installments  plus interest accrued including a five percent premium 
in addition  we intend to pay in cash the seventh monthly principal installment due october   plus accrued interest including a five percent premium 
see further discussion of this transaction in note d to the consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to june  and through september   we sold  shares of our common stock to institutional investors at prices ranging from to for an aggregate amount of approximately  net of finders fees are related expenses 
in connection with these transactions  we also issued  warrants with exercise prices ranging from to 
we intend to significantly expand our productive capacity of multiferon in sweden through the renovation of a  square foot facility purchased by viranative prior to our acquisition 
we estimate the cost of renovation to be approximately million  to be incurred over an month period 
based on multiferon product demand and available financing  the new facility could be further expanded and equipped 
such an expansion  if warranted  could cost up to an additional million 
the facility carries a year mortgage for approximately  we believe that our multiferon product can be manufactured in sufficient quantity and be priced at a level to offer patients an attractive alternative treatment to the synthetic interferons currently being marketed 
however  we can not assure you of approval of these projects 
required regulatory approvals are subject to the successful completion of lengthy and costly clinical trials 
the successful completion of any clinical trial project also depends on our ability to raise significant additional investment capital 
while subject to significant limitation  viragen at june   has available approximately million in net tax operating loss carryforwards expiring between and  which may be used to offset taxable income  if any  during those periods 
our ability to generate revenue during future periods is dependent upon obtaining regulatory approvals for commercialization of our different projects 
as we cannot determine that we will be successful in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals  we are unable to conclude that realization of benefits from our deferred tax assets is more likely than not  as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
as a result  we have recognized a valuation allowance to offset of the deferred tax assets related to these carryforwards 
we estimate that we will require funding of approximately million  over the next two years 
these funds would be used to fund operations including clinical trials 
we will also use planned future funding for continued product development  general working capital purposes  including administrative support functions  and possible equity investments in businesses complementary to our operations 
results of operations compared to as a result of our acquisition of viranative in september  the company began recognizing revenue through the sale of human leukocyte interferon 
since the date of the acquisition  a significant portion of our product sales and related costs were for the sale of bulk product semi purified to a customer in italy  alfa wasserman  under a contractual arrangement 
the loss of this customer prior to significant revenues from the sale of our highly purified product would have a material effect on our results of operations 
we believe the gross profit margin reflected on sales of bulk product is not necessarily indicative of the margins we anticipate on the sale of our finished interferon product  multiferon 
we expect the margins on finished product to be higher as the anticipated increase in selling price for highly purified product will exceed the incremental costs of the additional processing 
we expect our product mix to shift significantly from the sale of semi purified material to highly purified over the next year 
research and development costs research and development costs are comprised of scientific salaries and support fees  laboratory supplies  consulting fees  equipment rentals  repairs and maintenance  utilities and research related travel 
research and development costs for the fiscal year ended june  totaled approximately  a decrease of approximately  from the previous fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily attributed to cost savings from the termination of our development efforts on our omniferon product in our scottish facility totaling approximately  which was offset in part by research and development costs incurred by our swedish operations  acquired in september  totaling approximately  during the same period 
cost reductions at our scottish facility were primarily composed of scientific salaries  laboratory supplies and other related expenses 
also contributing to the overall decrease in research and development were decreases in our florida headquarter office totaling approximately  and  related to compensation on options and warrants granted and consulting fees  respectively 
we will continue incurring significant research and development costs related to additional clinical trial projects associated with multiferon as well as other projects to more fully develop potential commercial applications of our interferon product  as well as broaden our potential product lines in the areas of avian transgenics and oncology 
our ability to successfully conclude additional clinical trials  a prerequisite to eventual commercialization of any product  is dependent upon our ability to raise significant additional investment capital 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses are comprised of administrative personnel salaries and related expenses  lease expenses  utilities  repairs and maintenance  insurance  legal and accounting professional fees and depreciation 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  compared with approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  this increase of approximately  was attributable to administrative expenses incurred by our swedish subsidiary of approximately  which was acquired in september also contributing to the increase in selling general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended june   are increases totaling approximately  at our florida headquarters composed of increases of approximately  and  related to legal fees and compensation on options and warrants granted to consultants  respectively 
the increases at our florida headquarters were offset in part by a decrease in consulting fees totaling approximately  in addition  during the fiscal year ended june   our scottish subsidiary experienced increases in selling  general and administrative expenses totaling approximately  and  related to professional fees and facility lease expense  respectively 
we expect our overall selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in the foreseeable future as a result of the increase in the number of administrative employees and related expenses associated with the expansion of our swedish operations as well as additional management time spent on the commercialization of multiferon 
our ability to successfully commercialize multiferon will require additional marketing and promotional activities and is dependent upon our ability to independently raise significant additional investment capital 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of the purchase price allocated to separately identified intangible assets obtained in the acquisition of viranative in september the separately identified intangible assets acquired consist of developed technology and a customer contract 
the developed technology is being amortized over its estimated useful life of approximately years 
the customer contract is being amortized over the remaining term of the contract  which ends in december for the fiscal year ended june   amortization of intangible assets totaled approximately  there was no amortization of intangibles assets during the fiscal year ended june  interest and other income the primary components of interest and other income are interest earned on cash and cash equivalents  gains or losses on the disposal of property and equipment  and gains or losses on foreign exchange 
the decrease in interest and other income of approximately  during the fiscal year ended june  is attributed to the decrease in principal invested between the periods  decreased interest rates available between periods and the absence of a gain upon the disposal of fixed assets which was included in the twelve month period ended june  interest expense the significant increase in interest expense totaling approximately  for the twelve months ended june   is primarily attributable to approximately  of non cash interest expense on the convertible debentures which were issued in january interest expense for the twelve months ended june   includes interest accrued on the debentures  amortization of deferred financing costs and amortization of the discount on the debentures resulting from the detachable warrants  additional purchase option and the debentures beneficial conversion feature 
income tax benefit we are subject to tax in the united states  sweden  and the united kingdom 
these jurisdictions have different marginal tax rates 
for the year ended june   income tax benefit totaled approximately  this amount consisted of income tax benefits totaling approximately  and  for tax credits from research and development activities in scotland and the amortization expense on certain intangible assets related to the viranative acquisition  respectively 
due to the treatment of the identifiable intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes  we have a net deferred tax liability of approximately  based on our accumulated losses  a valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized 
as of june   we had a net operating loss carry forward of approximately million for us federal income tax purposes 
compared to research and development costs research and development costs totaled approximately  during fiscal this represents an increase of  when compared to fiscal this increase reflects significant research and development costs related to the development  scale up and clinical trial projects associated with our omniferon product 
we have also realized an overall increase in our research and development costs because of collaborative agreements entered into with the roslin institute edinburgh  the memorial sloan kettering cancer center  cancer research campaign technology ltd  and the national institute of health 
we have entered into these collaborative agreements in order to more fully develop the potential applications of our omniferon product  as well as broaden our future product offerings including those utilizing transgenics technologies and monoclonal antibodies 
the increase in research and development costs is consistent with the increase in the research related activity described 
during the year ended june   research salaries and support fees increased by  when compared to the previous year 
during fiscal  repairs and maintenance expense increased by  research related travel expenses increased by  these increases were offset by a decrease in laboratory supplies expense of  this decrease in laboratory supplies expense is related to the closing of our domestic research facility during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses totaled approximately  and  during fiscal years and  respectively 
this represents a decrease of approximately  between years 
we realized decreases in stock based compensation expense and penalties attributable to convertible promissory notes during fiscal stock based compensation expense decreased by  while penalties decreased by  when compared to the preceding year 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company modified the terms of stock options held by viragen s president resulting in a charge of  no similar charge was recognized during the fiscal year 
additionally  we recognized an adjustment of  during the fourth quarter of fiscal to reduce stock based compensation 
during that quarter  a consultant s warrants to acquire  shares of common stock expired without vesting 
the decrease in penalties is attributable to penalties incurred during the preceding year relating to the convertible promissory notes outstanding at that time 
no penalties were incurred during fiscal these decreases were offset by increases in other costs between fiscal years and during the year  administrative salaries and support fees increased by  and legal fees increased by  the increase in administrative salaries and support fees related specifically to consulting fees paid to administrative consultants 
the increase in legal fees is related to contract negotiations for research collaborations and patent activity 
viragen has also incurred legal fees in its successful defense against claims in the case  walter l 
smith v cytoferon corp  et al case no 
civ marcus 
equity in losses on unconsolidated company during fiscal  we recognized approximately  in losses related to our investment in inflammatics  inc down from  in the prior year 
these losses reflected of the losses incurred by inflammatics associated with the clinical testing of leukovax and the expensing of our excess investment costs 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed expensing our investment in inflammatics 
interest expense the significant decrease in interest expense is related to debt instruments that were outstanding during fiscal  but not outstanding during fiscal specifically  during fiscal  viragen had outstanding convertible promissory notes with a principal balance of  and a short term promissory note totaling  we incurred approximately  of additional interest expense on reset shares issued to investors upon the conversion of the convertible promissory notes 
additionally  we had two convertible promissory notes  each for  in principal  which were issued in february and march both promissory notes were converted into common stock in june item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we have not traded or otherwise transacted in derivatives nor do we expect to do so in the future 
we have established policies and internal processes related to the management of market risks which we use in the normal course of our business operations 
interest rate risk the fair value of long term debt is subject to interest rate risk 
while changes in market interest rates may affect the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt  we believe a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition  future results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk we conduct operations in several different countries 
the balance sheet accounts of our operations in sweden and scotland are translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes and resulting adjustments are made to stockholders equity 
the value of the respective local currency may strengthen or weaken against the us dollar  which would impact the value of stockholders investment in our common stock 
fluctuations in the value of the british pound and swedish krona against the us dollar have occurred during our history  which have resulted in unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses  which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and shown in the equity section of our balance sheet 
while most of the transactions of our us and european operations are denominated in the respective local currency  some transactions are denominated in other currencies 
since the accounting records of our foreign operations are kept in the respective local currency  any transactions denominated in other currencies are accounted for in the respective local currency at the time of the transaction 
upon settlement of such a transaction  any foreign currency gain or loss results in an adjustment to income 
our operating results may be impacted by the fluctuating exchange rates of foreign currencies  especially the british pound and swedish krona  in relation to the us dollar 
most of the revenue and expense items of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the respective local currency 
in sweden  we believe this serves as a natural hedge against exchange rate fluctuations because although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the foreign currency against the us dollar will result in lower revenue when translated into us dollars  operating expenses will also be lower in these circumstances 
a percent adverse change in the british pound or swedish krona against the us dollar would not have a material effect on our net loss 
we believe our foreign currency risk is not material 
we do not currently engage in hedging activities with respect to our foreign currency exposure 
however  we continually monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations 
we have not incurred significant realized losses on exchange transactions 
if realized losses on foreign transactions were to become significant  we would evaluate appropriate strategies  including the possible use of foreign exchange contracts  to reduce such losses 
we were not adversely impacted by the european union s adoption of the euro currency 
our foreign operations to date have been located in scotland and sweden which are not participating in the adoption of the euro 
intangible asset risk we have a substantial amount of intangible assets 
although at june  we believe our intangible assets are recoverable  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability 
we continue to monitor those assumptions and their consequent effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets
