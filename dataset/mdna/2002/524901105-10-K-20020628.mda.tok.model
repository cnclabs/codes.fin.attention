item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition business description legg mason  inc the parent  a holding company  and its subsidiaries collectively with the parent  legg mason are principally engaged in providing asset management  securities brokerage  investment banking and related financial services to individuals  institutions  corporations and municipalities 
terms such as we  us  our and company refer to legg mason 
legg mason has operations principally in the united states of america  the united kingdom and canada and also has offices in spain  switzerland and singapore 
the financial services industry in which legg mason operates is very competitive and highly regulated 
our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors including the amount of our assets under management  the volume of trading in securities  the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates  the level of customer margin and credit account balances and the demand for investment banking services 
in addition  overall market conditions  the diversification of services and products offered  investment performance and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in retaining and attracting clients 
in the past decade  we have experienced substantial expansion due to internal growth and the strategic acquisition of asset management firms that provided  among other things  a broader range of investment expertise  additional product diversification and increased assets under management 
legg mason currently operates through four business segments asset management  private client  capital markets and other 
the business segments are based upon factors such as the services provided and distribution channels utilized 
certain services that we offer are provided to clients through more than one of our business segments 
as such  the same revenue category may be reflected in multiple segments 
we allocate certain common income and expense items among our business segments based upon various methodologies and factors 
the asset management segment provides investment advisory services to company sponsored investment funds and asset management services to institutional and individual clients 
investment advisory and related fees earned by asset management vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product  the amount of assets under management and the type of services that are provided 
in addition  performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks 
the private client segment distributes a wide range of financial products through its branch distribution network  including equity and fixed income securities  proprietary and non affiliated mutual funds and annuities 
at march   private client s financial advisors operated out of retail branch offices 
the primary sources of net revenues for private client are commissions and principal credits earned on equity and fixed income transactions in customer brokerage accounts  distribution fees earned on mutual funds  fees earned on fee based brokerage and managed accounts and net interest from customers margin loan and credit account balances 
sales credits associated with underwritten offerings initiated in the capital markets segment are reported in private client when sold through its branch distribution network 
the capital markets segment consists of our equity and fixed income institutional sales and trading and corporate and public finance advisory and underwriting activities 
fixed income institutional sales and trading include transactions in both taxable and municipal products 
although we maintain securities in inventory primarily to facilitate customer transactions  capital markets also realizes profits and losses from trading activities 
sales credits associated with underwritten offerings are reported in capital markets when sold through institutional distribution channels 
the results of this business segment also include realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments acquired in connection with merchant banking and investment banking activities 
the other segment consists principally of our real estate service business and unallocated corporate revenues and expenses 
all references to fiscal  or refer to our march fiscal year then ended 
business environment for the us economy  fiscal was a period of slower economic growth  declines in corporate earnings and rising unemployment levels 
during fiscal  the equity markets continued to be volatile and weak  particularly in the technology and telecommunications sectors 
corporate failures and the associated accounting questions have also contributed to the negative market conditions and low investor confidence 
finally  the events of the september terrorist attacks and the political unrest abroad have also contributed to the sluggish economy 
in an effort to stimulate the lagging economy  the us federal reserve significantly lowered the overnight interest rate times or over the last months 
although we were not physically impacted by the events of september  its effect on the economy and investor confidence negatively impacted our business and  in particular  our private client business 
despite the difficult market conditions  we were able to achieve record net revenues primarily as a result of the addition of fees from acquired entities and growth in fixed income investment advisory accounts 
results of operations our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets  particularly in the united states 
results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results 
many of our activities have fixed operating costs that do not decline with reduced levels of business activity 
accordingly  sustained periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to affect our profitability adversely 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  items in the consolidated statements of earnings as percentages of net revenues and the increase decrease by item as a percentage of the amount for the previous period percentage of net revenues period to period change years ended march  compared compared to to revenues investment advisory and related fees commissions principal transactions investment banking interest other total revenues 
interest expense net revenues non interest expenses compensation and benefits communications and technology occupancy amortization of intangible assets other total non interest expenses earnings before income tax provision income tax provision net earnings fiscal compared with fiscal financial overview in fiscal  net revenues reached record levels and increased to billion  primarily as a result of an increase in investment advisory and related fees 
on august   we acquired private capital management  lp and its affiliated entities pcm  a high net worth investment manager in naples  florida 
at acquisition date  pcm managed billion of assets  primarily in small to mid cap stocks 
on october   we acquired royce associates  inc royce  an investment manager located in new york city 
at acquisition date  royce managed billion of assets  primarily in small and micro cap mutual funds 
both acquisitions were accounted for as purchase transactions 
under purchase accounting  the net assets and results of operations of both pcm and royce are included in our financial statements from the respective dates of their acquisition 
revenues from investment advisory and related activities including distribution fees from mutual funds rose million or to million in fiscal  primarily as a result of the acquisitions of pcm and royce  which contributed million of the increase 
the remainder of the increase is primarily attributable to growth in assets under management in fixed income advisory accounts 
revenues from securities brokerage activities  including both commissions and principal transactions  declined to million as a result of a decrease in retail securities transactions and non affiliated mutual fund and variable annuity sales 
these declines were offset in part by increases in fixed income and equity institutional securities transaction volume 
revenues from investment banking activities increased to million primarily due to a million increase in new issue sales concessions and increased municipal banking fees 
other revenues increased to million primarily as a result of realized and unrealized gains on firm investments and an increase in loan origination fees  partially offset by the sale of a merchant banking related investment in the prior fiscal year 
our net interest profit declined to million from million in the prior fiscal year as a result of lower average interest rates earned on firm investments  lower customer margin account balances and an increase in acquisition related debt 
net interest profit accounted for of consolidated pre tax profits  down significantly from in the prior fiscal year 
despite the increase in net revenues during fiscal  net earnings declined to million from fiscal as a result of increased expenses  including profitability based incentive compensation  the addition of expenses of acquired entities and litigation related costs 
in fiscal  basic earnings per share declined to from in fiscal diluted earnings per share in fiscal declined to from in fiscal the results for fiscal also include the effect of adopting statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which resulted in an expense reduction of million million net of tax

asset management represented of consolidated net revenues in fiscal  an increase from in fiscal revenues from asset management tend to be more stable than those from private client and capital markets because they are less affected by changes in securities market conditions 
total assets under management were billion as of march   an increase of billion or from march  as of march   approximately billion or of assets under management were in equity related products and billion or were in fixed income related products 
in fiscal  pcm and royce contributed fees of million and the internal growth of our core fixed income institutional manager increased revenues by million 
performance fees  which are included in investment advisory and related fees  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  principally due to fees earned by pcm and royce  as well as additional fees earned by other subsidiaries 
private client the difficult market conditions in fiscal  as well as significantly lower interest rates and lower retail transaction volume  negatively impacted private client 
accordingly  net revenues decreased to million for fiscal private client represented of consolidated net revenues in fiscal  a decrease from in the prior fiscal year 
net interest profit in private client decreased to million in fiscal because of significantly lower average interest rates and lower average customer margin account balances  offset in part by an increase in average firm investment balances  principally funds segregated for regulatory purposes 
commissions from retail securities transactions  including listed and over the counter trading  decreased approximately million or during fiscal from the prior year 
net revenues also declined from decreases in retail generated principal transactions and sales of non affiliated mutual funds and annuities 
capital markets capital markets achieved record net revenues in fiscal net revenues increased to million in fiscal  primarily as a result of higher institutional equity and fixed income transaction volume 
capital markets represented of consolidated net revenues in fiscal  an increase from in fiscal other other consists principally of the results of our real estate service business and unallocated corporate revenues and expenses 
net revenues were down slightly for the fiscal year from million to million  primarily due to a decrease in interest income resulting from lower interest rates 
expenses interest expense interest expense primarily consists of interest paid to customers on their credit account balances and interest incurred in connection with our long and short term borrowings 
interest expense declined million or in fiscal  principally due to the sharp decrease in average interest rates paid on customer credit account balances and stock borrow balances 
offsetting these declines  we incurred million of interest expense on long term debt issued in fiscal to fund the acquisitions of pcm and royce 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding legg mason s long term debt 
compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense increased to million  primarily attributable to significantly higher profitability based incentive compensation which increased by million  the addition of million in expenses as a result of the acquisitions of pcm and royce and an increase in vested deferred compensation of million during fiscal these increases were offset in part by a decline in variable sales commissions of million 
a substantial part of compensation expense fluctuates in proportion to the level of business activity 
other compensation costs  primarily salaries and benefits  are fixed and typically do not decline with reduced levels of business activity 
communications and technology communications and technology expense declined to million as a result of decreased costs for telephone usage  quote services and printing  offset in part by the addition of expenses of acquired entities 
occupancy occupancy costs increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of a full year impact of prior year expansion  including an operations center and new branch offices  as well as the addition of expenses of acquired entities 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets increased million or to million from the prior fiscal year  primarily attributable to million of amortization of pcm s asset management contracts  offset in part by the impact of adopting sfas no 
 under which goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are no longer amortized 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other expenses other expenses increased to million  primarily attributable to an increase in litigation related costs of million net of recoveries of million 
fiscal net litigation related costs were million compared to million in fiscal income tax provision the income tax provision decreased to million in fiscal due to lower pre tax earnings and lower state income taxes 
legg mason s effective income tax rate was in fiscal  down from in fiscal due to lower state income taxes and the impact of adopting sfas no 
 which eliminated non deductible amortization of goodwill for book purposes

private client net revenues in private client were up from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily as a result of a increase in net interest income to million driven by higher average interest rates and higher levels of customer margin account balances and firm investments  predominately funds segregated for regulatory purposes 
sales of non proprietary mutual funds also increased 
offsetting these increases were lower volumes of retail over the counter  listed and fixed income transactions 
capital markets in fiscal  net revenues in capital markets increased to million as a result of an increase in institutional equity securities transaction volume and sales and trading profits on taxable fixed income products 
these increases were offset in part by a decline in investment banking fees  primarily from equity and municipal underwritings 
other in fiscal  net revenues declined to million as a result of a decline in loan origination fees at the parent s real estate services subsidiary 
expenses interest expense interest expense increased to million  primarily due to higher interest bearing customer credit account balances and higher average interest rates 
compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense increased to million as a result of higher fixed compensation costs  primarily attributable to an increase in the number of employees and higher incentive and sales compensation related to asset management activities 
communications and technology communications and technology expense increased to million due to new and expanded branch office locations  increased investments in technology and increased quote and telephone usage due to an increase in the number of employees 
occupancy occupancy costs increased to million as a result of additional costs for new and expanded branch office locations and the impact of acquired companies 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets increased million or due to business acquisitions 
other expenses other expenses increased to million 
this increase is primarily attributable to the impact of a full year of expenses of legg mason investors  increased promotional expenses and costs associated with the acquisition of perigee investment counsel inc these increases were offset in part by a decrease in floor brokerage and clearing fees 
income tax provision the income tax provision rose to million in fiscal as a result of increased pre tax earnings and an increase in legg mason s effective tax rate to in fiscal from in the prior year 
the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to non deductible foreign losses and higher statutory tax rates in foreign jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources the primary objective of our capital structure and funding practices is to appropriately support legg mason s business strategies  as well as the regulatory capital requirements of our subsidiaries  and to provide needed liquidity at all times 
liquidity and the access to liquidity are essential to the success of our on going operations 
our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses 
we continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying our businesses 
these opportunities may involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require  among other things  the raising of additional capital and or the issuance of additional debt 
we emphasize diversification of funding sources and seek to manage exposure to refinancing risk 
legg mason has committed short term financing on both a secured and unsecured basis 
secured financing is obtained through the use of securities lending agreements and secured bank loans  which are primarily collateralized by short term us government and agency securities  highly rated corporate debt  money market funds and equity securities 
short term funding is generally obtained at rates based upon benchmarks such as federal funds  libor or money market rates 
we maintain a committed  unsecured revolving credit facility of million that matures on june  for general corporate purposes 
the facility has restrictive covenants that require us  among other things  to maintain specified levels of net worth and debt to equity ratios 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility as of march  and our real estate service subsidiary has two committed short term financing facilities that mature on september  and are used in connection with its business operations 
the first is a million warehouse line of credit from a national bank million and million outstanding at march  and  respectively that is used to provide interim financing for the funding of commercial mortgage loans 
the parent is a guarantor on this credit facility 
the weighted average interest rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the second credit facility is a financing agreement with the same national bank that allows for borrowing funds for short term investing of up to million at an interest rate of based upon the amount of customer escrow funds that are on deposit with the same bank 
the credit facility is collateralized by the securities that are purchased with the funds  which are primarily short term us government and agency securities  highly rated corporate commercial paper and money market funds 
there were no outstanding balances on this line as of march  and we have maintained compliance with all applicable covenants of these facilities throughout the year 
in the event that we fail to meet the covenants specified by these credit facilities  these lines of credit may not be available to us 
legg mason also maintains uncommitted credit facilities from several banks and financial institutions 
uncommitted facilities consist of lines of credit that we have been advised are available  but for which no contractual lending obligation exists 
as such  these uncommitted facilities would likely be unavailable to us if any material adverse effect on our financial condition occurred 
we have not relied on the issuance of short term commercial paper to fund our operating needs nor do we utilize unconsolidated special purpose entities to provide operating liquidity 
legg mason s assets consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  collateralized short term receivables  investment advisory fee receivables  securities owned and borrowed  intangible assets and goodwill 
our assets are principally funded by payables to customers  securities loaned  bank loans  long term debt and equity 
the collateralized short term receivables consist primarily of customer margin loans  securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed  all of which are secured by us government and agency securities and corporate debt and equity securities 
the investment advisory fee receivables  although not collateralized  are short term in nature and collectibility is reasonably certain 
excess cash is currently invested primarily in institutional money market funds 
the highly liquid nature of our assets provides us with flexibility in financing and managing our anticipated operating needs 
legg mason s total assets increased billion from billion at march  to billion at march  this increase was principally due to a net increase in intangible assets and goodwill of million and million  respectively  primarily the result of the acquisitions of pcm and royce 
the increase in intangible assets and goodwill was accompanied by a corresponding increase in long term debt of million  which was the primary source of funds for the acquisitions of pcm and royce 
stockholders equity surpassed the one billion dollar mark for the first time in legg mason s history 
as of march   stockholders equity was billion 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million  which primarily reflects the use of cash in connection with the acquisitions of pcm and royce 
for fiscal  cash flows from operating activities provided approximately million  primarily attributable to net earnings  adjusted for non cash charges 
cash and securities segregated for regulatory purposes or deposited with clearing organizations increased million reflecting an increase in customer credit account balances and a decrease in customer margin account balances 
as of march   legg mason had three long term fixed rate debt facilities 
we had million outstanding of senior notes due february   which bear interest at a stated rate of 
the notes were originally issued in february at a discount to yield 
during fiscal  we issued long term fixed rate debt to fund acquisitions 
on june   we issued million principal amount at maturity of zero coupon contingent convertible senior notes due on june   resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
the convertible notes were issued in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers at an initial offering price of per  principal amount at maturity 
the discounted price reflects a yield to maturity of per year 
upon certain events  including the sale price of our stock reaching certain thresholds  the convertible notes being rated below specified credit ratings and the convertible notes being called for redemption  each note is convertible into shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment 
we may redeem the convertible notes for cash on or after june  at their accreted value 
in addition  we may be required to repurchase the convertible notes at their accreted value  at the option of the holders  on june     and every five years thereafter until or upon a change in control of legg mason 
such repurchases can be paid in cash  shares of our common stock or a combination of both 
approximately million shares of common stock are reserved for issuance upon conversion 
on july   we issued million principal amount of senior notes due july   which bear interest at 
the notes were sold at a discount to yield 
the net proceeds were approximately million 
on august   legg mason purchased pcm for cash of million  excluding acquisition costs 
the transaction includes two contingent payments based on pcm s revenue growth for the years ending on the third and fifth anniversaries of closing  with the aggregate purchase price to be no more than billion 
as such  we may be required to make maximum payments in the amount of million on august  and million on august  if certain conditions are met 
on october   we completed the acquisition of royce for cash of million  excluding acquisition costs 
the transaction includes three contingent payments based on royce s revenue growth for the years ending on the third  fourth and fifth anniversaries of closing  with the aggregate purchase price to be no more than million 
we may  therefore  be required to make a maximum payment in the amount of million on october  as part of this acquisition if certain conditions are met 
we have the option to pay as much as of the remaining purchase price for royce in common stock 
we expect to fund these commitments through operations  available lines of credit or the capital markets 
in addition to pcm and royce  we acquired two smaller investment management firms for approximately million in cash 
as of march   we had million remaining for the issuance of additional debt or convertible debt securities pursuant to a shelf registration statement 
a shelf filing permits us to register securities in advance and then sell them when financing needs arise or market conditions are favorable 
we intend to use the shelf registration for general corporate purposes including the expansion of our business 
there are no assurances as to the terms of any securities that may be issued pursuant to the shelf registration since they depend on market conditions and interest rates at the time of issuance 
certain finance subsidiaries of legg mason previously issued secured  fixed rate long term debt in connection with their investment operations 
the long term debt of the finance subsidiaries is scheduled to mature in fiscal as described in market risk below  there are specific assets that were purchased with the proceeds of the debt that will mature or will be available for sale to meet this obligation 
during fiscal  the board of directors authorized legg mason  at its discretion  to purchase up to million shares of its own common stock 
as of march   we repurchased  shares for million 
in fiscal and  we paid cash dividends of million and million  respectively 
the parent s broker dealer subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the securities and exchange commission s uniform net capital rule  which is designed to measure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker dealers 
as of march   the broker dealer subsidiaries had aggregate net capital of million  which exceeded minimum net capital requirements by million 
the amount of the broker dealers net assets that may be distributed is subject to restrictions under applicable net capital rules 
the parent s trust subsidiary is subject to the requirements of the office of thrift supervision  which requires compliance with two overlapping sets of regulatory capital standards 
we believe that the trust subsidiary has met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject 
contractual and contingent obligations legg mason has contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with our short and long term debt and non cancelable lease agreements 
in addition  we may also be required to make contingent payments under business purchase agreements if certain future events occur 
see notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure related to our commitments 
the following table sets forth these contractual and contingent obligations by fiscal year contractual and contingent obligations in millions thereafter total contractual obligations short term borrowings by contract maturity long term borrowings by contract maturity a coupon interest on long term borrowings minimum rental commitments total contractual obligations  contingent obligations contingent payments related to business acquisitions b total contractual and contingent obligations c

this obligation will be funded by proceeds from the related investments  which will mature or will be available for sale in payments in reflect amounts that may be due to holders of the zero coupon contingent convertible senior notes  which represents the accreted value on the earliest possible date that the holders may require us to purchase the notes 
legg mason may choose to pay the purchase price in cash  shares of our common stock or a combination of both 
b the amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of business purchase agreements 
c the table above does not include approximately million in capital commitments to investment partnerships in which legg mason is a limited partner 
these obligations will be funded  as required  through the end of the commitment periods that range from to risk management risk is an inherent part of our business and activities 
the extent to which we properly and effectively identify  assess  monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our activities is critical to our soundness and profitability 
we seek to identify  assess  monitor and manage the following principal risks involved in our business activities funding  market  credit  operational and legal 
risk management at legg mason is a multi faceted process that requires communication  judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets 
senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and requires specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment and control of various risks 
currently  we have four formal risk management committees credit  capital markets commitments  new products and new business 
our risk management policies  procedures and methodologies are fluid in nature and are subject to ongoing review and modification 
funding risk is discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
market risk the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments we own is referred to as market risk 
our market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from a change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates  credit spreads  equity prices and the correlation among them  along with the level of volatility 
interest rate risks result primarily from exposure to changes in the yield curve  the volatility of interest rates  mortgage prepayments and credit spreads 
equity price risks result from exposure to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities  equity baskets and equity indices 
legg mason makes dealer markets in equity and debt securities 
to facilitate customer order flow  we may be required to own equity and debt securities in our trading and inventory accounts 
the majority of our trading and inventory accounts consist of fixed income debt instruments 
we attempt to hedge our exposure to market risk by managing our net long or short position 
for example  we may hedge a municipal portfolio by taking an offsetting position in a related futures contract 
due to imperfections in correlations  gains and losses can occur even for positions that are hedged 
position limits in trading and inventory accounts are established and monitored on an ongoing basis 
each day  consolidated position and exposure reports are prepared and distributed to various levels of management  which enable management to monitor inventory levels and results of the trading groups 
we also monitor inventory aging  pricing  concentration and securities ratings

see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for the related gross long and short fair values of financial instruments owned and investments 
fair value of other financial instruments includes us treasury securities segregated for regulatory purposes of million and million at march  and  respectively 
the purpose of legg mason investors finance subsidiaries see note of notes to consolidated financial statements is to raise funds by issuing secured fixed rate loan securities and to use the proceeds to invest in a portfolio of bonds issued by various financial institutions which are not generally available to the public in tranches small enough for the retail investor 
the investments of finance subsidiaries and the notes payable of finance subsidiaries on the consolidated statements of financial condition are directly related  have offsetting risk characteristics and do not represent a material market risk to legg mason 
additionally  claims of the note holders are limited to the assets of the finance subsidiaries  which limits our exposure to default risk on the investments 
the assets and liabilities of the finance subsidiaries mature or are available for sale during fiscal in addition to the financial instruments included in the table  we have three long term debt facilities  which are described in liquidity and capital resources 
our net investments in foreign subsidiaries are impacted by fluctuations of foreign exchange rates 
these fluctuations are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and are not material to our financial condition 
for fiscal  the impact of currency fluctuations on our results of operations was not material 
credit risk credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a client  counterparty or issuer of securities or other instruments held by legg mason fails to perform its contractual obligations to us 
we follow industry practice to reduce credit risk related to various investing and financing activities by obtaining and maintaining collateral 
credit exposure associated with our private client business consists primarily of customer margin accounts  which are monitored daily 
we monitor exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and perform sensitivity analyses on a regular basis in connection with our margin lending activities 
we adjust margin requirements if we believe the risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions 
operational risk operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions  deficiencies in our operating systems  business disruptions and inadequacies or breaches in our internal control processes 
we operate different businesses in diverse markets and we are reliant on the ability of our employees and systems to process high numbers of transactions often within short time frames 
in the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems  human error or improper action by employees  legg mason could suffer financial loss  regulatory sanctions or damage to its reputation 
in order to mitigate and control operational risk  we have developed and continue to enhance policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels 
for example  we have procedures that require that all transactions are confirmed on a timely basis  that position valuations are subject to periodic independent review procedures and that collateral and adequate documentation are obtained from counterparties in appropriate circumstances 
september heightened the need for comprehensive disaster recovery plans 
disaster recovery plans exist for our critical systems  and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate 
we believe that our disaster recovery program  including off site back up technology and operational facilities  is adequate to handle a reasonable business disruption 
however  there can be no assurances that a disaster directly affecting our headquarters or our operations center would not have a material adverse impact 
insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses 
we also use periodic self assessments  internal audit reviews and independent consultants as a further check on operational risk and exposure 
legal risk legal risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
legg mason is subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
we have various procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds  credit granting  collection activities  money laundering and record keeping 
critical accounting policies accounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
understanding these policies  therefore  is a key factor in understanding the reported results of operations and the financial position of legg mason 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information 
certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements 
due to their nature  estimates involve judgment based upon available information 
therefore  actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we consider the following to be among legg mason s current accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments 
valuation of financial instruments substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value 
cash and securities segregated for regulatory purposes or deposited with clearing organizations  financial instruments owned  investment securities  investments of finance subsidiaries and financial instruments sold  but not yet purchased on the consolidated statements of financial condition include forms of financial instruments 
unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument 
where available  we use prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker or dealer price quotations 
for investments in illiquid and privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values  the determination of fair value requires management to estimate the value of the securities based upon available information such as projected cash flows and a review of the financial and market conditions of the underlying company 
in instances where a security is subject to transfer restrictions  the value of the security is based primarily on the quoted price of the same security without restriction but may be reduced by an amount estimated to reflect such restrictions 
in addition  even where the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote  certain assumptions may be required to determine the fair value 
for instance  we generally assume that the size of positions in securities that we hold would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities if we sell them  and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner 
however  these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized upon disposition could be different from the current carrying value 
we evaluate our non trading securities for other than temporary impairment 
impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the current value for an extended period of time 
if an other than temporary impairment is determined to exist  the difference between the value of the investment security recorded on the financial statements and its current fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined 
as of march   we own approximately million of financial instruments that are valued solely on our assumptions or estimates 
intangible assets and goodwill in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
in addition  it provides that the cost of an acquired entity must be allocated to the assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at date of acquisition 
the excess cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired must be recognized as goodwill 
sfas no 
provides that goodwill is no longer amortized and the value of an identifiable intangible asset must be amortized over its useful life  unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life 
in allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets  we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired 
we determine fair values of intangible assets acquired  primarily asset management contracts and trade names  based upon certain estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows  growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience  estimated contract lives  discount rates and investment performance 
the determination of estimated contract lives requires judgement based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination dates will be renewed 
the value of contracts to manage assets in mutual funds and the value of trade names are classified as indefinite life intangible assets 
the assignment of indefinite lives to mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage mutual funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost 
the assignment of indefinite lives to trade names is based on the assumption that they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely 
for significant acquisitions  including pcm and royce  we engage the services of third party consultants to perform independent valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
as of march   we had million in goodwill  million in indefinite life intangible assets and million in amortizable intangible assets 
the estimated useful lives of our amortizable intangible assets range from to years 
intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment at each reporting period utilizing an undiscounted cash flow analysis 
sfas no 
requires intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill to be reviewed for impairment at least annually based on a fair value analysis 
if an asset is impaired  the difference between the value of the asset reflected on our financial statements and its current fair value must be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs 
for intangible assets with indefinite lives  fair value is determined based on anticipated discounted cash flows 
goodwill is impaired when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit  we use valuation techniques based on multiples of revenues and discounted cash flows  similar to the models we employ in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target 
substantially all of our goodwill is assigned to our asset management operating segment 
we have defined our asset management reporting units to be wealth management  institutional and mutual funds  which are one level below the operating segment 
during fiscal  legg mason recognized an impairment charge of million related to terminated asset management contracts acquired in a prior business combination 
as of march   we have determined that our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets have not been impaired  based upon the methods described above 
some of our business acquisitions  such as pcm and royce  involved closely held companies in which certain key employees were also owners of those companies 
in establishing the overall purchase price  we may include contingent consideration whereby only a portion of the purchase price is paid on the acquisition date 
these contingent payments are consistent with our methods of valuing and establishing the purchase price  and we record these payments as additional purchase price and not compensation when the contingencies are met 
generally contingent payments are recorded as additional goodwill 
reserves for losses and contingencies legg mason is the subject of customer complaints and has also been named as a defendant in various legal actions arising primarily from securities brokerage  asset management and investment banking activities  including certain class actions which primarily allege violations of securities laws and seek unspecified damages which could be substantial 
legg mason has also been involved in governmental and self regulatory agency investigations and proceedings 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  we have established reserves for potential losses that may result from such complaints  legal actions  investigations and proceedings 
in establishing these reserves  we use our judgment to determine the probability that losses may be incurred and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the losses 
in making these decisions  we base our judgments on our knowledge of the situations  consultation with legal counsel and our experience 
if our judgments prove to be incorrect  our reserves may not accurately reflect actual losses that result from these actions  which could materially affect results in the period the expenses are ultimately determined 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures regarding contingencies 
special purpose entities special purpose entities spes are trusts  partnerships  corporations or other vehicles that are established for a limited business purpose 
spes generally involve the transfer of assets and liabilities in which the transferor may or may not have continued involvement  derive continued benefit  exhibit control or have recourse 
we do not utilize spes as a form of financing or to provide liquidity  nor have we recognized any gains from the sale of assets to spes 
our primary relationship with spes involves one of our asset management subsidiaries  which is the collateral manager of a collateralized debt obligation cdo spe 
the cdo was established during fiscal as a vehicle for investors and issued approximately million of debt and acquired a portfolio consisting primarily of high quality asset backed securities 
we did not sell any assets to the cdo 
for our services as collateral manager  we receive senior and subordinated management fees up to approximately million annually 
we may be removed as collateral manager under certain conditions 
currently  we do not own an equity interest in the entity  however  we have entered into a derivative contract whereby we may purchase million of preference shares approximately of the entity in four years 
other than this derivative  we have no financial commitments or guarantees to the cdo and the underlying debt is non recourse to us as collateral manager 
as such  we do not consolidate this entity 
the fasb has currently undertaken a project to address accounting for spes and we will continue to monitor the fasb s project to determine whether or not consolidation of the cdo will be required in the future 
earnings per share basic earnings per share eps is calculated by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
diluted eps is similar to basic eps  but adjusts for the effect of potential common shares 
diluted eps does not include million shares that may be issued upon conversion of the zero coupon contingent convertible senior notes due to the contingent nature of the conversion feature  which provides for conversion only in limited circumstances  including the sale price of our common stock reaching certain thresholds  the notes being rated below specified credit ratings and the notes being called for redemption 
in the event that the notes become convertible into shares of common stock  or the shares are required to be included in eps  diluted eps will likely be negatively impacted

legg mason s future revenues may fluctuate due to numerous factors  such as the total value and composition of assets under management  the volume of trading in securities  the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates  the relative investment performance of company sponsored investment funds and other asset management products compared with competing offerings and market indices  investor sentiment and confidence  general economic conditions  the ability of legg mason to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels  the level of margin and customer account balances  competitive conditions in each of our business segments  the demand for investment banking services  the ability to attract and retain key personnel and the effects of acquisitions  including prior acquisitions 
our future operating results are also dependent upon the level of operating expenses  which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons variations in the level of compensation expense incurred by legg mason as a result of changes in the number of total employees  competitive factors  or other reasons  variations in expenses and capital costs  including depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges incurred by us to maintain our administrative infrastructure  unanticipated costs that may be incurred by legg mason from time to time to protect client goodwill or in connection with litigation  and the effects of acquisitions 
legg mason s business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal  regulatory  accounting  tax and compliance requirements that may have a substantial effect on our business and results of operations 
effects of inflation based on today s modest inflationary rates and because our assets are primarily monetary in nature  consisting of cash and cash equivalents  securities and receivables  we believe that our assets are not significantly affected by inflation 
the rate of inflation  however  can affect various expenses  including employee compensation  communications and technology and occupancy  which may not be readily recoverable in charges for services provided by us
