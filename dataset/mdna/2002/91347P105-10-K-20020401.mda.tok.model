revenues are recognized at the time of shipment and passage of title 
the company also receives non refundable advanced license payments in connection with certain joint development and technology evaluation agreements it enters into 
these payments are deferred until a license agreement is executed or negotiations have ceased and there is no likelihood of executing a license agreement
