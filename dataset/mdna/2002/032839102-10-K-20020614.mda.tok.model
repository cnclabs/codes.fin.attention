management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and supplemental data contained elsewhere in this report 
results of operations comparison of years ended march  and general 
net income increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary component of this increase in earnings for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was an increase of million in net interest income after the provision for loan losses 
in addition  non interest income increased million 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in non interest expense of million and an increase in tax expense of million 
the returns on average assets and average stockholders equity for fiscal were and  respectively  as compared to 
and  respectively  for fiscal net interest income 
net interest income increased by million during fiscal due to a larger increase in the volume of interest earning assets compared to the volume of interest bearing liabilities coupled with a greater decrease in rates of interest bearing liabilities as compared to the decrease in rates of interest earning assets 
the average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities increased to billion and billion in fiscal  respectively  from billion and billion  respectively  in fiscal the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the average yield on interest earning assets in fiscal versus in fiscal decreased  as did the average cost on interest bearing liabilities in fiscal versus in fiscal 
the net interest margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal and the interest rate spread increased to from in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in the net interest margin is reflective of a decrease in the cost of funds  offset by a smaller decrease in yields on loans as interest rates decreased 
these factors are reflected in the analysis of changes in net interest income  arising from changes in the volume of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and the rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities 
the analysis indicates that the decreases in the volume of interest earning liabilities increased net interest income in fiscal by approximately million 
in addition  there was a million increase in net interest income caused by the combination of rate and rate volume changes 
provision for loan losses 
provision for loan losses increased million from  in fiscal to million in fiscal based on management s ongoing evaluation of asset quality 
there was an increase in net charge offs of million in overall loans in fiscal  primarily due to increased commercial business loan charge offs  however the quality of the loan portfolio continues to be good 
the corporation s allowance for loan losses increased million from million at march  to million at march  this amount represented of total loans at march   as compared to 
of total loans at march  for further discussion of the allowance for loan losses  see financial condition allowance for loan and foreclosure losses 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal primarily due to an increase of million in gain on sale of loans 
this increase was largely due to the lower interest rate environment which resulted in significantly higher levels of refinancing activity 
this resulted in increased mortgage servicing rights gains due to increased loan sales 
net income from operations of real estate investments also increased million largely due to increased lot sales 
other non interest income  which includes a variety of loan fee and other miscellaneous fee income  also increased million for fiscal service charges on deposits increased  essentially due to a growth in deposits and net gain on sale of investments and securities increased  for fiscal partially offsetting these increases were decreases in other categories 
loan servicing income decreased million due to increased amortization of mortgage servicing rights and income from insurance commissions decreased  due to decreased sales 
non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as a result of several factors 
the majority of the increase was attributed to an increase in compensation expense of million  largely due to an increase in incentive compensation resulting from increased loan production 
other non interest expense increased million  largely due to the partial impairment of three securities  and increases in postage  office supplies  retail and other expenses 
in addition  furniture and equipment expense increased  in fiscal  primarily due to normal replacement costs and increased contractual services  and data processing expense increased  occupancy expense increased  and marketing expense increased  during this fiscal year 
income taxes 
income tax expense increased million for fiscal as compared to fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was as compared to for fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item comparison of years ended march  and general 
net income increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary component of this increase in earnings for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was a decrease of million in non interest expense 
this was partially offset by a decrease of million in net interest income after the provision for loan losses 
the returns on average assets and average stockholders equity for fiscal were

net interest income decreased by million during fiscal due to increases in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities increased to billion and billion in fiscal  respectively  from billion and billion  respectively  in fiscal the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the average yield on interest earning assets in fiscal versus in fiscal increased  as did the average cost on interest bearing liabilities in fiscal versus in fiscal 
the net interest margin decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal and the interest rate spread decreased to from for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in the net interest margin is reflective of an increase in the cost of funds  offset by increased yields on loans as rates rise 
these factors are reflected in the analysis of changes in net interest income  arising from changes in the volume of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and the rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities 
the analysis indicates that the increases in the volume of interest earning liabilities decreased net interest income in fiscal by approximately million 
in addition  there was a million decrease in net interest income as a result of rate and rate volume changes 
provision for loan losses 
provision for loan losses decreased from million in fiscal to  in fiscal based on management s ongoing evaluation of asset quality 
there was a slight increase in net charge offs of  in overall loans in fiscal  primarily due to increased mortgage loan charge offs  and the quality of the loan portfolio continues to be good 
the corporation s allowance for loan losses decreased slightly from million at march  to million at march  this amount represented 
of total loans at march   as compared to of total loans at march  for further discussion of the allowance for loan losses  see financial condition allowance for loan and foreclosure losses 
non interest income 
non interest income decreased  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal primarily due to the decrease of million in net income from operations of real estate investments 
this decrease was largely due to decreased resort and golf net income at the partnerships and losses on the sale of four condominium units in a development in bloomington  minnesota 
other non interest income  which includes a variety of loan fee and other miscellaneous fee income  also decreased  for fiscal partially offsetting these decreases were increases in other categories 
the net gain on sale of loans increased by million largely due to increased volume of loan sales during the year 
service charges on deposits increased  essentially due to a growth in deposits and loan servicing income increased  due to increased volume of loans serviced for others 
income from insurance commissions increased  due to increased sales and net gain on sale of investments and securities increased  for fiscal non interest expense 
non interest expense decreased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as a result of several factors 
the majority of the decrease was attributed to merger related expenses of million million  net of tax due to the merger with fcbf and increased goodwill expense of million million net of tax in fiscal unamortized goodwill from a previous merger became impaired and was written off in fiscal exclusive of the one time charges for the merger and goodwill  non interest expense increased  in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense of million  largely due to an increase in incentive compensation resulting from increased loan production 
in addition  occupancy expense increased  during this fiscal year 
there was an increase in furniture and equipment expense of  in fiscal  primarily due to normal replacement costs  and data processing expense increased  these increases were partially offset by decreases in other categories 
other non interest expense decreased  due to decreases in postage  retail and other expenses and federal insurance premiums decreased  due to a reduction in the assessment in fiscal also  marketing expense decreased  due to decreased promotions 
income taxes 
income tax expense decreased  for fiscal as compared to fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was as compared to for fiscal the unusual effective tax rate for fiscal is a result of certain merger related costs and goodwill amortization that are not deductible for tax purposes

the average balances of loans include non performing loans  interest of which is recognized on a cash basis 
rate volume analysis the most significant impact on the corporation s net interest income between periods is derived from the interaction of changes in the volume of and rates earned or paid on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the volume of earning dollars in loans and investments  compared to the volume of interest bearing liabilities represented by deposits and borrowings  combined with the spread  produces the changes in net interest income between periods 
the following table shows the relative contribution of the changes in average volume and average interest rates on changes in net interest income for the periods indicated

liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  the bank made dividend payments of million to the corporation 
the bank is subject to certain regulatory limitations relative to its ability to pay dividends to the corporation 
management believes that the corporation will not be adversely affected by these dividend limitations and that projected future dividends from the bank will be sufficient to meet the corporation s liquidity needs 
in addition to dividends from the bank  the corporation also could sell capital stock or debt issues through the capital markets as alternative sources of funds  as well as obtain loans from outside banks 
the bank s primary sources of funds are principal and interest payments on loans receivable and mortgage related securities  sales of mortgage loans originated for sale  fhlb advances  deposits and other borrowings 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and mortgage related securities are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank is required by the ots to maintain levels of liquid investments in qualifying types of us government and agency securities and other investments sufficient to ensure its safe and sound operation 
at march  and  the bank s liquidity ratio was and  respectively 
in fiscal  operating activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million 
operating cash flows for fiscal included earnings of million and million of net proceeds from the origination and sale of mortgage loans held for sale 
investing activities in fiscal resulted in a net cash outflow of million 
primary investing activities resulting in cash outflows were million for the purchase of securities and million for the increase in net loans receivable 
the most significant cash inflows from investing activities were principal repayments on loans of million  proceeds of sales and maturities of investment securities of million  and million of principal repayments received on mortgage related securities 
financing activities resulted in a net cash inflow of million including a net increase in deposits of million  a net decrease in borrowings of million and a cash outflow of million for treasury stock purchases 
at march   the corporation had outstanding commitments to originate million of loans  commitments to extend funds to or on behalf of customers pursuant to lines and letters of credit of million  and  of loans sold with recourse to the corporation in the event of default by the borrower 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit during the twelve months following march  amounted to billion  and scheduled maturities of borrowings during the same period totaled million 
the bank has entered into agreements with certain brokers that will provide blocks of funds at specified interest rates for an identified fee 
management believes adequate capital and borrowings are available from various sources to fund all commitments to the extent required 
at march   the bank s capital exceeded all capital requirements of the ots as mandated by federal law and regulations on both a current and fully phased in basis 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item financial condition general 
total assets of the corporation increased million or from billion at march  to billion at march  this increase was primarily funded by net increases in deposits of million 
these funds were generally invested in loans receivable and investment securities 
mortgage related securities 
mortgage related securities both available for sale and held to maturity decreased million as a net result during the year of i purchases of million  ii principal repayments and market value adjustments of million and iii sales of million 
mortgage related securities consisted of million of mortgage backed securities million were available for sale and million were held to maturity and million of mortgage derivative securities million were available for sale and million were held to maturity at march  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in item mortgage related securities are subject to inherent risks based upon the future performance of the underlying collateral ie  mortgage loans for these securities 
among these risks are prepayment risk and interest rate risk 
should general interest rate levels decline  the mortgage related securities portfolio would be subject to i prepayments as borrowers typically would seek to obtain financing at lower rates  ii a decline in interest income received on adjustable rate mortgage related securities  and iii an increase in fair value of fixed rate mortgage related securities 
conversely  should general interest rate levels increase  the mortgage related securities portfolio would be subject to i a longer term to maturity as borrowers would be less likely to prepay their loans  ii an increase in interest income received on adjustable rate mortgage related securities  iii a decline in fair value of fixed rate mortgage related securities  and iv a decline in fair value of adjustable rate mortgage related securities to an extent dependent upon the level of interest rate increases  the time period to the next interest rate repricing date for the individual security  and the applicable periodic annual and or lifetime cap which could limit the degree to which the individual security could reprice within a given time period 
loans receivable 
total net loans including loans held for sale increased million during fiscal from billion at march   to billion at march  the activity included i originations and purchases of billion  ii sales of billion  and iii principal repayments and other reductions of million 
see note to the corporation s consolidated financial statements included in item for more information 
non performing assets 
non performing assets consisting of non accrual loans  non performing real estate held for development and sale  foreclosed properties and repossessed assets increased to million or of total assets at march  from million or of total assets at march  non performing assets are summarized as follows for the dates indicated at march  dollars in thousands non accrual loans single family residential      multi family residential commercial real estate  construction and land consumer commercial business  total non accrual loans      real estate held for development and sale    foreclosed properties and repossessed assets  net   total non performing assets      performing troubled debt restructurings total non accrual loans to total loans total non performing assets to total assets allowance for loan losses to total loans allowance for loan losses to total non accrual loans allowance for loan and foreclosure losses to total non performing assets non accrual loans increased million in fiscal to million at march  this increase is largely attributable to loans acquired in the merger with ledger 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for a discussion of the ledger merger 
at march   there was one non accrual commercial real estate loan with a carrying value of greater than million and it was acquired in the merger 
the loan is a unit motel located in schiller park  illinois  with a carrying value of million 
the original loan was for million  of which the bank is an participant 
loans are placed on non accrual status when  in the judgment of management  the probability of collection of interest is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income 
as a matter of policy  the corporation does not accrue interest on loans past due more than days 
non performing real estate held for development and sale decreased  during fiscal at march   there were no properties in non performing real estate held for development and sale with a carrying value greater than million 
foreclosed properties and repossessed assets increased million in fiscal this increase was not attributable to any one property 
at march   there were no properties in foreclosed properties with a carrying value greater than million 
the total of performing troubled debt restructurings at march  increased by  and does not include any loans larger than million 
allowances for loan and foreclosure losses 
the corporation s loan portfolio  foreclosed properties  and repossessed assets are evaluated on a continuing basis to determine the necessity for additions to the allowances for losses and the related balance in the allowances 
these evaluations consider several factors including  but not limited to  general economic conditions  collateral value  loan portfolio composition  loan delinquencies  prior loss experience  anticipated loss of interest and losses inherent in the portfolio 
the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses includes a review of known loan problems as well as potential loan problems based upon historical trends and ratios 
foreclosed properties are recorded at the lower of carrying or fair value with charge offs  if any  charged to the allowance for loan losses prior to transfer to foreclosed property 
the fair value is primarily based on appraisals  discounted cash flow analysis the majority of which are based on current occupancy and lease rates and pending offers 
a summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses follows year ended march  dollars in thousands allowance at beginning of year      purchase of ledger capital corp

the level of allowances for loan losses considers numerous factors including the outstanding loan balances in various categories of loans and the relative risk of each category 
the bank also considers economic trends in its overall level of general allowances 
historically  the bank s non performing and classified assets have fluctuated with economic trends  both locally and nationally 
at march   the bank s present level of classified assets would have remained relatively unchanged from the year ended march  without the addition of the non accrual loans acquired from the recent merger 
this is in keeping with local and national economic conditions 
management believes that the increase in the allowance  in response to the non performing loans acquired in the merger  and the present level of the allowance at march  are prudent 
loan charge offs were million and million for the fiscal years ending march  and  respectively 
total charge offs for the years ended march  and increased million and  respectively  from the prior fiscal years 
the increase in charge offs for fiscal was largely due to an increase of million in commercial business loan charge offs largely resulting from two loans to a software consulting firm totalling million 
mortgage loan charge offs increased  while consumer loan charge offs decreased  for the year ended march  the increase in charge offs for fiscal was largely due to an increase of  in mortgage loan charge offs 
commercial business loan and consumer loan charge offs decreased  and  respectively  for the year ended march  recoveries only slightly offset the charge offs for the year ended march  and such recoveries decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal recoveries increased  during the fiscal year ended march  the increased level in net charge offs of million and  for the respective years ended march  and do not represent changes in the quality of the loan portfolio  but instead generally reflect the local and national trends in overall consumer debt levels and bankruptcy filings

management also continues to pursue all practical and legal methods of collection  repossession and disposal  and adheres to high underwriting standards in the origination process in order to continue to maintain strong asset quality 
deposits 
deposits increased million during fiscal to billion  of which million was due to increases in certificates of deposit  million was due to increases in money market accounts  million was due to increases in now accounts  and million in passbook accounts 
these increases were due to the acquisition of deposits from the ledger merger  which contributed approximately million to deposits  as well as promotions and related growth of deposit households 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for a discussion of the ledger merger 
the weighted average cost of deposits decreased to at fiscal year end compared to at fiscal year end borrowings 
fhlb advances decreased million during fiscal because as advances matured they were not replaced with new borrowings 
cash proceeds from callable securities during the low interest rate environment as well as increases in deposit accounts both served to reduce the need for new borrowings as advances matured 
at march   advances totaled million with a weighted average interest rate of compared to advances of million with a weighted average interest rate of at march  reverse repurchase agreements decreased million during fiscal other loans payable increased million from the prior fiscal year 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item stockholders equity 
stockholders equity at march  was million  or of total assets  compared to million  or of total assets at march  stockholders equity increased during the year as a result of i the acquisition of ledger of million  ii comprehensive income of million  which includes net income of million and a change in net unrealized losses on available for sale securities as a part of accumulated other comprehensive income of  iii the exercise of stock options of million  iv the vesting of recognition plan shares of  v employee stock plan purchases of million  and vi the tax benefit from certain stock options of  these were offset by i the purchase of treasury stock of million and ii the payment of cash dividends of million 
significant accounting policies 
there are a number of accounting policies that require the use of judgment 
one of the most significant accounting policies requiring the use of judgment is establishing the amount of the allowance for loan losses 
management evaluates the credit quality of the loan portfolio and the level of the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses 
see the section titled allowances for loan losses later in this section for discussions on the methodology used in determining the level of the allowance for loan losses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management 
the primary function of asset and liability management is to provide liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities within specified maturities and or repricing dates 
interest rate risk is the imbalance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at a given maturity or repricing date  and is commonly referred to as the interest rate gap the gap 
a positive gap exists when there are more assets than liabilities maturing or repricing within the same time frame 
a negative gap occurs when there are more liabilities than assets maturing or repricing within the same time frame 
the corporation s strategy for asset and liability management is to maintain an interest rate gap that minimizes the impact of interest rate movements on the net interest margin 
as part of this strategy  the corporation sells substantially all new originations of long term  fixed rate  single family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market  invests in adjustable rate or medium term  fixed rate  single family residential mortgage loans  invests in medium term mortgage related securities  and invests in consumer loans which generally have shorter terms to maturity and higher and or adjustable interest rates 
the corporation occasionally sells adjustable rate loans at origination to private investors 
the corporation also originates multi family residential and commercial real estate loans  which generally have adjustable or floating interest rates and or shorter terms to maturity than conventional single family residential loans 
long term  fixed rate  single family mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary market are generally committed for sale at the time the interest rate is locked with the borrower 
as such  these loans involve little interest rate risk to the corporation 
although management believes that its asset liability management strategies reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the corporation s operations  material and prolonged changes in interest rates would adversely affect the corporation s operations 
the corporation s cumulative net gap position at march  for one year or less was a positive of total assets  as compared to a negative at march  the calculation of a gap position requires management to make a number of assumptions as to when an asset or liability will reprice or mature 
management believes that its assumptions approximate actual experience and considers them reasonable  although the actual amortization and repayment of assets and liabilities may vary substantially 
the corporation utilizes certain prepayment assumptions and decay rates from various sources such as the ots and as determined by management 
the following tables summarize the corporation s interest rate sensitivity gap position as of march  and  respectively
