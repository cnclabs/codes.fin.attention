item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations following is management s discussion and analysis of significant factors that have affected the company s financial position and its results of operations for the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as described more fully below  the company s results for the first three quarters of fiscal were adversely affected by several factors  including ongoing integration challenges in the stores acquired in the lamonts acquisition and the subsequent closure of six of those stores  and the general slowdown in the retail economic environment beginning in early fiscal  which was intensified by the events of september th 
the company s results improved in the fourth quarter of fiscal  offsetting operating losses incurred in the first three quarters of the fiscal year 
nevertheless  the company experienced a significant reduction in its operating results for the full year in fiscal fiscal and results both include weeks as compared to fiscal results  which includes weeks 
management believes the company s results of operations for fiscal were not materially affected by results attributable to the rd week 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to its revenue recognition policy  the realizability of its customer credit card receivables  the accounting for the securitization and sale of customer credit card receivables under its receivable securitization program  the carrying value of its merchandise inventories  the adequacy of its store closure reserves  and the valuation of its long lived assets and deferred tax assets 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in the past  actual results have not been materially different from the company s estimates 
some of the company s significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity than its other accounting policies 
the policies described below have been identified as critical to the company s business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
the impact and associated risks related to these policies on the company s business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition policy net retail sales are recognized at the point of sale  net of estimated sales returns and allowances and exclusive of sales tax 
net retail sales also include all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction for shipping and handling  including customer delivery charges 
revenues on special order sales are recognized when the merchandise is delivered to the customer and the merchandise has been paid for in its entirety 
the company records an allowance for estimated sales returns in the period in which the related sale occurs 
these estimates are based primarily on historical sales returns 
if the historical data used to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  revenue could be overstated and adjustments to the allowance for estimated sales returns may be necessary 
customer credit card receivables customer credit card receivables consist primarily of customer credit card receivables that do not meet certain eligibility requirements of the company s receivables securitization program 
these receivables are retained by gcrc  which is consolidated in the company s financial statements 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts on such ineligible receivables to reflect expected credit losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments on such accounts 
a considerable amount of judgment is required to assess the ultimate realization of the customer credit card receivables and the credit worthiness of each customer 
furthermore  these judgments must be continually updated and evaluated 
estimates of potential losses are based on historical as well as current data  including the aging of the receivables  recent bankruptcy trends  delinquency rates  historical charge off patterns  recovery rates and other portfolio data 
other factors  including the general and retail economic environment in the markets in which the company operates  are also considered 
historically  the company s credit losses on such ineligible receivables have been consistent and within expectations 
however  if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  adjustment to those estimates may be required 
accounting for the securitization and sale of receivables the company conveys all of the customer credit card receivables generated under its private label customer credit cards to a wholly owned subsidiary  gcrc  on a daily basis and those receivables that meet certain eligibility requirements of the program are simultaneously conveyed to gcc trust to be used as collateral for securities issued to investors 
gcc trust is a qualified special purpose entity and is not consolidated in the company s financial statements 
the transfers of such receivables are accounted for as sales for financial reporting purposes pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  and as such  the transferred receivables are removed from the company s balance sheet at the time of the transfer 
the company retains a beneficial ownership interest in certain of the receivables transferred under the program and also retains an uncertificated ownership interest in the retained interest to future interest income interest only strip and other receivables that do not meet certain eligibility requirements of the program 
the retained interests and the interest only strips are carried at their estimated fair values  which are estimated based upon the present value of the expected future cash flows  calculated using management s best estimates of key assumptions about anticipated credit losses  account prepayment speeds  discount rates and other factors necessary to derive an estimate of fair values 
the gain or loss on the sale of the receivables is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the transfer to their relative fair values at the date of transfer 
the certificated portion of the retained interests are considered readily marketable and are classified as available for sale and carried at their estimated fair values in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
inventory valuation merchandise inventory  which consists of merchandise held for resale  is valued at the lower of lifo last in  first out cost or market using the retail inventory method rim of accounting 
inherent in the rim calculation are various judgements and estimates including  among others  merchandise markon  markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost  as well as resulting gross margins 
the company applies various methodologies to ensure that the application of the rim is consistent for all periods presented 
such methodologies include the development of consistent cost to retail ratios and the grouping of homogenous classes of merchandise 
estimated inventory shrinkage between physical inventory dates is based on historical experience 
should actual inventory shrinkage results differ from the company s estimate  year end revisions to inventory shrinkage expense recognized on an interim basis may be required 
estimating the market value of the company s merchandise inventory requires assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
such estimates are based on actual and forecasted sales trends  current inventory levels and aging information by merchandise categories 
the company records markdowns to value merchandise inventories at net realizable value 
if forecasted sales are not achieved  or if other indicators of impairment are present  additional markdowns may be needed in future periods to clear excess or slow moving merchandise  which may result in lower gross margins 
reserve for store closure costs the company records an estimated reserve for store closure costs in the period in which a decision is made to close a store 
costs that may be included in the reserve include estimated lease termination costs net of estimated sublease revenue or favorable lease settlements  asset impairment charges including the write off of allocated goodwill and favorable lease rights  estimated severance and other incremental costs expected to be incurred in connection with the closure of the store 
such estimates may be subject to change should actual amounts differ from the amounts originally estimated 
as of the end of fiscal  the company had a reserve for store closure costs totaling  which consisted primarily of estimated future lease obligations for three store locations that were closed in fiscal in the event the company is not successful in selling or subleasing these three locations as soon as management expects  additional reserves for store closure costs with respect to those three stores may be recorded 
in addition  in the event the company decides to close additional store locations in fiscal  additional reserves for store closure costs  which may be material  may be recorded 
impairment of long lived assets the company s long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment  goodwill  favorable lease rights and other long term assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
with respect to store locations  the company performs an evaluation of whether an impairment charge should be recorded whenever a store experiences unfavorable operating performance 
a store s assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing its estimated undiscounted cash flows over its estimated lease term to its carrying value 
if the cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value  a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the discounted future cash flows of the asset is recognized 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a variety of factors  including historical experience in similar locations  changes in merchandising  promotional or operating strategy that may affect the profitability of a particular location  knowledge of the market area and in some cases  expected sale proceeds or sublease income  and independent appraisals 
in addition  the analysis assumes that new store locations typically take three years to achieve their full profit potential 
various uncertainties  including but not limited to changes in consumer preferences  increased competition or a general deterioration in economic conditions could adversely impact the expected cash flows to be generated by an asset or group of assets 
in fiscal  the company recorded asset impairment charges in connection with store closures  and such charges are included in store closure costs in the accompanying consolidated income statement 
no asset impairment charges were recorded for store locations continuing to be operated 
however  if actual performance for those stores or fair value estimates are less favorable than management s projections  future asset impairment charges may be necessary 
similar procedures are used when analyzing other corporate assets for impairment 
effective the beginning of fiscal  the provisions of sfas no 
will be implemented and as a result  the company will no longer amortize previously recorded goodwill 
the company will instead perform an initial impairment review of goodwill during the first six months of fiscal  as required by the statement  with an annual impairment review thereafter  unless more frequent reviews are warranted by specific events or circumstances 
there can be no assurance that at the time these reviews are completed that material impairment charges will not be recorded 
income taxes the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the value of these assets 
in determining the appropriate valuation allowance  management considers all available evidence for certain tax credit  net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards that would likely expire prior to their utilization 
management believes it is more likely than not that the company will generate sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate carryforward periods to realize the benefit of its remaining net deferred tax assets 
however  if the available evidence were to change in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance may be required  resulting in additional income tax expense 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items from the company s consolidated income statements  expressed as a percent of net sales fiscal compared to fiscal net sales fiscal years net sales net credit revenues net leased department revenues total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization

extraordinary item loss on early extinguishment of debt net of tax benefit net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal fiscal included weeks as compared to fiscal  which included weeks 
on a comparable week versus week basis  net sales for fiscal increased by million  or  as compared to fiscal fiscal sales reflect a full year of sales generated by the stores acquired in the lamonts acquisition net of lower sales volume resulting from the closure of six of those stores in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  which reflect net sales generated for five months after the opening of the stores in september comparable store sales for fiscal  which includes sales for stores open for the full period in both years  increased by as compared to the same week period of the prior year 
the company operated department stores and specialty apparel stores as of the end of fiscal as compared to department stores and specialty apparel stores as of the end of fiscal thirty seven of those stores were opened in the second half of fiscal  however  and were not open for the full period of the prior year 
as described more fully in note to the accompanying financial statements  six of the acquired stores were closed in june and july  with one of those stores subsequently reopened in september the company closed one additional store at the end of january  resulting in a total of six stores closed in fiscal net credit revenues net credit revenues related to the company s credit card receivables portfolio decreased by approximately  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal as a percent of net sales  net credit revenues were of net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal net credit revenues consist of the following in thousands of dollars service charge revenues   interest expense on securitized receivables   charge offs on receivables sold and provision for credit losses on receivables ineligible for sale   gain on sale of receivables service charge revenues increased by  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase is primarily due to additional service charge revenues generated by newly originated customer credit card accounts in new stores opened since the same period of the prior year 
the increase is also due to an increase in the volume of late charge fees collected on delinquent credit card balances as compared to the same period of the prior year 
the decrease as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to lower average outstanding balances on newly originated customer accounts in the new stores opened in fiscal such accounts continue to generate lower service charge revenues as compared to those produced by more established accounts 
the company s credit sales as a percent of total sales were in fiscal as compared to in fiscal excluding credit sales generated in the new stores  credit sales as a percentage of total sales were in fiscal as compared to in fiscal interest expense on securitized receivables increased by  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase is due to a higher level of average outstanding securitized borrowings resulting from the issuance of the series certificate in november renewed in november  partially offset by a lower weighted average interest rate applicable to all securitized borrowings during the period in fiscal as compared to in fiscal 
charge offs on receivables sold and the provision for credit losses on receivables ineligible for sale increased by  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percentage of net sales  such losses increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal these increases reflect higher bankruptcies and higher unemployment rates caused by the economic downturn in certain of the company s market areas 
as a result of a decrease in the volume of receivables sold as compared to the prior year  the gain on the sale of receivables decreased by  to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal net leased department revenues net rental income generated by the company s various leased departments increased by approximately  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this increase is primarily due to additional revenues generated by the leased shoe departments in of the company s pacific northwest and alaska locations  which were operated by an independent lessee since their opening in the second half of fiscal the company terminated that lease in august and re opened company operated shoe departments in of those stores 
pursuant to sab no 
 sales generated in those departments after the termination of the lease are included in total sales as opposed to net leased department revenues for financial reporting purposes

the dollar increase is consistent with the increase in sales volume 
the company s gross margin percentage decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to higher markdowns as a percentage of sales as compared to the prior year 
the increased level of markdowns was primarily attributable to the clearance of excess seasonal inventory levels in the first half of fiscal resulting from lower than expected sales in certain of the pacific northwest and alaska store locations and to inventory liquidations at the six stores which were closed 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the dollar increase is primarily attributable to operating costs associated with a full year of operating the stores opened in the second half of fiscal  as compared to five months of such costs incurred in the prior year 
in addition  the company has continued to experience higher health care and workers compensation costs  as well as higher utilities costs in california 
these factors  combined with lower than expected sales volume generated by the new stores opened in fiscal  contributed to the increase in selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales 
the company is continuing to implement programs aimed at reducing operating costs in the new stores  as well as throughout all areas of the company 
however no assurance can be given that the company will be able to fully offset the impact of such higher costs 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense  which includes the amortization of intangibles goodwill and favorable lease rights  increased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal as a percent of net sales  depreciation and amortization expense increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the dollar increase is primarily due to additional depreciation related to assets acquired from lamonts  capital expenditures for new stores and for the renovation of existing stores  and for information systems enhancements  both to integrate the newly acquired stores into the company s existing systems and for other system enhancements 
the increase is also due to an increase in the amortization of assets acquired under capital leases and to the amortization of goodwill and favorable lease rights recorded as a result of the lamonts acquisition 
effective the beginning of fiscal  the company will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
as a result  goodwill will no longer be amortized and will instead be evaluated for impairment at least annually  or at any time certain indicators of impairment arise 
the amortization of goodwill totaled  in fiscal and  in fiscal the company will continue to amortize favorable lease rights over their estimated lease terms 
new store pre opening costs new store pre opening costs  which are expensed as incurred  typically include costs such as payroll and fringe benefits for store associates  store rents  temporary storage  utilities  travel  grand opening advertising  credit solicitation and other costs incurred prior to the opening of a store

during the second quarter of fiscal  the company closed six stores and discontinued the use of an outsourced distribution center facility located in kent  washington 
the company closed one additional store in january the company recognized a net amount of  in connection with the closure of those stores in fiscal such costs represent approximately million of estimated lease termination costs  asset impairment charges including the write off of allocated goodwill and favorable lease rights  estimated severance and other incremental costs expected to be incurred in connection with the closure of the store  less million of cash proceeds received from the sale of lease rights and favorable lease terminations 
the company re opened one of the closed stores in the third quarter of fiscal costs associated with the re opening of the store were classified as selling  general and administrative costs and are not included in store closure costs for financial reporting purposes 
interest expense interest expense  which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs  increased by approximately  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  an increase of 
as a percent of net sales  interest expense decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal these decreases are primarily due to lower average outstanding borrowings on the company s working capital facility  as well as a decrease in the weighted average interest rate applicable to the facility in fiscal as compared to in fiscal 
these decreases were partially offset by higher interest resulting from the completion of a million mortgage loan and approximately million of additional fixtures and equipment lease financings in the first half of fiscal as a result of the finalization of the new revolving credit facility on february  and other new financings in the first quarter of fiscal  management expects interest expense and the amortization of deferred financing costs will increase in fiscal see liquidity and capital resources 
interest expense related to securitized receivables is reflected as a reduction of net credit revenues and is not included in interest expense for financial reporting purposes 
miscellaneous income miscellaneous income  which includes the amortization of deferred income and other miscellaneous income and expense amounts  increased by approximately  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal as a percent of net sales  miscellaneous income remained unchanged at in fiscal and the dollar increase relates to an increase in the amortization of the deferred gain on fixtures and equipment sale leaseback transactions

the increase is also due to a increase in comparable store sales 
fiscal included weeks of sales as compared to weeks in fiscal excluding the rd week in fiscal  net sales increased by  with a increase in comparable store sales 
the increase in comparable store sales in fiscal resulted partially from the conversion of the shoe departments in gottschalks locations from leased to owned departments  effective august  sales generated in those departments prior to the termination of the lease on august  are included in net leased department revenues  as described below 
the company operated department stores and specialty apparel stores as of the end of fiscal  as compared to department stores and specialty apparel stores as of the end of fiscal thirty seven of these department stores were opened in the second half of fiscal  including the stores which were acquired from lamonts on july  and opened during the period beginning august and continuing through september   and the three new stores opened in grants pass  oregon  walla walla  washington and redding  california on august  november and november   respectively

as a percent of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the dollar increase is primarily due to operating costs associated with the new stores opened during the second half of fiscal the decrease as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to leveraging the company s fixed costs and corporate overhead against a higher sales base 
this decrease was partially offset by higher costs as a percentage of net sales incurred in the new stores opened in fiscal  which were operated with a higher payroll and advertising expense structure during that period than the company s existing stores 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense  which includes the amortization of intangibles goodwill and favorable lease rights  increased by approximately million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  an increase of

as a percent of net sales  interest expense remained unchanged at in fiscal and the dollar increase is primarily due to higher average outstanding borrowings on the company s working capital facility and an increase in the weighted average interest rate applicable to the facility in fiscal compared to in fiscal 
the increase is also due to the issuance of the million note payable in connection with the lamonts acquisition 
interest expense related to securitized receivables is reflected as a reduction of net credit revenues and is not included in interest expense for financial reporting purposes 
miscellaneous income miscellaneous income  which includes the amortization of deferred income and other miscellaneous income and expense amounts  decreased to approximately million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal as a percent of net sales  miscellaneous income decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal income taxes the company s effective tax rate was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net income as a result of the foregoing  the company reported net income of million  or per share basic and diluted  in fiscal this amount includes million pre tax of non recurring costs incurred in connection with the re opening of the stores acquired from lamonts 
excluding such costs on an after tax basis  net income for fiscal increased by million  or per share  to million  or per share in fiscal  as compared to million  or per share excluding the non recurring item  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital requirements are currently met through a combination of cash provided by operations  borrowings under its senior revolving credit facility  sales of proprietary credit card accounts under its receivables securitization program  short term trade and factor credit and by proceeds from external financings and sale transactions 
as described more fully in the company s annual report on form k for the year ended february   the company incurred a significant outflow of cash in fiscal in connection with the lamonts acquisition  using its then existing line of credit to fund a portion of the cash purchase price  as well as non recurring costs associated with opening and initial stocking of the stores with inventory and supplies and capital expenditures to refurbish the stores and integrate information systems 
in addition  the acquired stores results for the first five months of their operation fell short of expected levels 
these factors contributed to the million operating cash flow deficit in fiscal in fiscal  the company generated a total of million of positive cash flow from operations as compared to the million deficit from operations in fiscal this improvement was primarily due to a reduction of inventory levels in response to current selling trends 
despite the increased level of cash generated from operations  however  the company nevertheless experienced significantly reduced earnings and a strained liquidity position throughout fiscal the company s results for the first three quarters of fiscal were adversely affected by several factors  including ongoing integration challenges in the stores acquired in the lamonts acquisition and the subsequent closure of six of those stores  and the general slowdown in the retail economic environment beginning in early fiscal  which was intensified by the events of september th 
the company s results improved in the fourth quarter of fiscal  offsetting the operating losses incurred in the first three quarters of the fiscal year 
despite the improved fourth quarter results  the company experienced a significant reduction in its operating results for the full year in fiscal as described more fully below  recent efforts to improve the company s liquidity position have been focused primarily on the following areas i refinancing the company s senior revolving credit facility  which was successfully completed on february   ii completing other financing and sale transactions  iii restoring trade and factor credit  iv selling  subleasing or closing underperforming stores  iv extending the current commitment period for the series certificates  which expires on october   and v and reducing operating costs 
the company s liquidity position is also partially dependent upon credit enhancement provided by an affiliate 
in the event any of these sources of liquidity are not adequate  the company may be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies to improve its liquidity position  which could include the sale of additional stores 
because the company is already highly leveraged  the ability to obtain additional or alternative sources of financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  new store openings  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes is limited 
if the estimates or assumptions relative to any one of these sources of liquidity are not realized  or if those sources of liquidity become reduced or are significantly delayed beyond expected dates  the company s liquidity position  financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
sources of liquidity senior secured credit facility on february   the company finalized a three year senior revolving credit facility with general electric capital corporation ge capital as agent  and the cit group business credit as syndication agent 
the new facility the ge facility replaced the company s previous revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire on march  the ge facility provides up to million of working capital financing through january   with million of that facility provided under a tranche a revolving credit facility including a million letter of credit sub facility and the remaining million provided through a fully funded tranche b facility 
borrowings under the facility are subject to a restrictive borrowing base equal to the lesser of specified percentages of i the cost of eligible inventory and ii the net recovery value of eligible inventory  as determined by a monthly valuation performed by an independent appraiser 
such borrowings are further limited by a requirement to maintain a minimum of million of excess availability at all times  and certain other reserves that are established by ge capital 
outstanding borrowings under the facility totaled million as of february   and excess borrowing availability under the facility  after the deduction of the minimum availability requirement and other reserves  totaled million as of february  the company classified a total of million and million as of february  and february   respectively  as long term in the accompanying financial statements  representing that portion of outstanding borrowings under the facility which are not expected to be repaid within one year of the respective balance sheet dates 
the initial proceeds from the ge facility were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the previous revolving credit facility  including a prepayment penalty  and other transaction fees and costs 
substantially all of the company s assets  including its merchandise inventories  the retained interest in receivables sold and the stock of gcrc  are pledged to ge capital under this facility 
interest charged on amounts borrowed under the tranche a revolving facility were initially at the prime rate plus per annum at february   or at the company s option  at the applicable libor rate plus per annum at february  
in addition  the company pays an unused commitment fee equal to 
on the average unused daily balance of the tranche a facility 
libor interest rates applicable to the tranche a facility were reduced to libor plus after achieving the initial liquidity event  and will be further reduced to libor plus after achieving the subsequent liquidity event  which is described below 
amounts borrowed under the tranche b facility bear interest at prime plus  or at the company s option  at libor plus 
beginning in fiscal  the interest rate applicable to the tranche a facility may be adjusted upwards or downwards on a quarterly basis based on a pricing matrix which is tied to the company s leverage ratio as defined in the agreement 
under the pricing matrix  the applicable interest rate can range from a rate as low as prime plus or libor plus  to as high as prime plus  or libor plus 
the ge facility contains restrictive financial and operating covenants  including the requirement to maintain a minimum twelve month trailing ebitda and the requirement to maintain a minimum accounts payable to inventory ratio 
in addition  the ge facility does not permit the repayment of the subordinated note on its scheduled maturity date of august   which has resulted in the maturity of that note automatically being extended to august  management believes the company is in compliance with all restrictive financial and operating covenants applicable to the ge facility as of february  and through the date of this report 
the ge facility also requires that the company obtain million of external financing to improve its liquidity position  with a minimum of million due by march  the initial liquidity event and the remaining amount due by april  the subsequent liquidity event 
as described below  the company satisfied the requirements of the initial liquidity event by completing three transactions prior to march   which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million 
however  the company was not able to fund the remaining million required for the subsequent liquidity event by april  as a result  beginning april  and continuing until the million has been received  the company must maintain a two week trailing average minimum borrowing availability of at least million  with a minimum of million of borrowing availability at all times 
at april   management believes the company was in compliance with these provisions 
the company has received a commitment from a financial institution to finance the company s partnership interest in its corporate headquarters 
net proceeds from that transaction are expected to be million  and the receipt of those proceeds  which is expected on or before june   will result in a total of million received from external financings 
the company has requested that the lenders under the ge facility the lenders amend this provision of the facility to reduce the total amount of external financings required to million and extend the subsequent liquidity event to june  three of the four lenders have approved this revision and the company is awaiting the required approval of the fourth lender 
under the terms of the requested revisions  the company will be required to pay an amendment fee of  in addition  in the event the company does not receive the remaining million required to achieve the subsequent liquidity event by june   the company will be required to pay an additional fee of approximately  any significant delay in the transaction beyond its current expected completion date  or the failure to find alternative sources of financing in the event the transaction is not completed  would have a material adverse affect on the company s liquidity position 
trade credit and transactions with affiliate the success of the company s business is highly dependant upon the adequacy of trade credit offered by key factors and vendors  the vendors ability and willingness to sell it products at favorable prices and terms  and the willingness of vendors to ship merchandise on a timely basis 
restrictions to the amount of trade credit granted by key factors and vendors can adversely impact the volume of merchandise the company is able to purchase 
any significant reduction in the volume of merchandise the company is able to purchase  or a prolonged disruption in the timing of when merchandise is received  would have a material adverse affect on the company s business  liquidity position  and results of operations 
in the months prior to the finalization of the ge facility on february   the company experienced a significant reduction in the level of unsecured credit offered by many of its factors and vendors 
because the company s fiscal holiday merchandise had already been received  this reduction in trade and factor credit did not materially affect the company s level of inventory receipts for fiscal management believes the reduction of trade and factor credit was not only precipitated by the pending expiration of the company s previous revolving credit facility  but was also caused by factors outside the company s control  including the events of september th and the fiscal bankruptcy filing by a major retailer 
following the finalization of the ge facility  the level of unsecured credit offered by vendors increased  but unsecured credit granted by key factors  which can represent over of total trade credit granted to the company  remained restricted 
management subsequently negotiated the restoration of secured credit lines with those key factors by issuing standby letters of credit to provide partial guarantees 
however  the issuance of those standby letters of credit served to reduce borrowing availability under the ge facility 
in order to offset most of this availability reduction  harris  an affiliate of the company  agreed to provide short term credit enhancement to the ge facility under the terms of a credit facilitation agreement entered into with the company on february  harris became an affiliate of the company in fiscal when the company acquired substantially all of the assets and business of harris 
the purchase price for the assets consisted of approximately million shares  or of the company s common stock as of that date  and the subordinated note 
under the credit facilitation agreement  harris agreed to guarantee an irrevocable standby letter of credit the harris letter of credit issued by a bank to ge capital in the amount of million for the purpose of collateralizing standby letters of credit that were subsequently issued under the ge facility to key factors 
the harris letter of credit currently expires on june  and is collateralized by proceeds that may be received from the proposed sale of the company s ownership interest in the partnership that owns its corporate headquarters the proposed transaction  but is otherwise a general and unsecured obligation of the company 
repayment of drawings under the harris letter of credit is also guaranteed by the company s chairman of the board and certain of his family members 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
under the current terms of the credit facilitation agreement  the harris letter of credit will be reduced dollar for dollar by the amount of net proceeds received from the proposed transaction 
the company has requested that harris extend the expiration date of the letter of credit through september   and remove the provision that the letter of credit be reduced dollar for dollar for proceeds received from the proposed transaction 
while management expects that harris will agree to such revisions  no assurance can be given that such revisions will be approved 
in the event harris does not agree to such revisions  the credit enhancement to the ge facility will be substantially reduced in the event proceeds from the proposed transaction are received prior to june   and will be eliminated entirely on june  the standby letters of credit issued to key factors expire in june and july the company expects to extend the expiration date of those letters of credit in order to ensure the company continues to receive factor credit 
if harris does not agree to extend its letter of credit beyond june   the letters of credit issued to factors would no longer be supported by the harris letter of credit and their extension would result in a million reduction to the borrowing availability under the ge facility 
there can be no assurance the company will continue to receive an adequate level of key factor and vendor trade credit to support its operations 
any further reductions of trade and factor support or a lack of further improvements in the level of unsecured factor and trade support granted to the company may impair the company s ability to purchase an adequate level of merchandise to support its operations 
receivables securitization program the company conveys all of its accounts receivable arising under its private label credit cards on an ongoing basis under a receivables securitization facility 
the facility provides the company with an additional source of working capital and long term financing that has historically been more cost effective than traditional debt financing 
under the program  monthly cash flows generated by the company s credit card portfolio  consisting of principal and interest collections  are first used to pay certain costs of the program  which include the payment of principal when required and interest to the investor  and monthly servicing fees to the company 
any excess cash flows are then available to fund additional purchases of newly generated receivables  ultimately serving as a source of working capital financing for the company 
as described more fully in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the company accounts for the securitization of receivables as sales for financial reporting purposes  and as such  the transferred receivables are removed from the company s balance sheet at the time of the transfer 
securities are issued under the program by gcc trust  which is not consolidated in the company s financial statements 
the company retains an interest in certain of the securities issued by gcc trust  and also retains an interest in receivables that are ineligible for transfer to gcc trust 
on march   gcc trust issued a million principal amount fixed base class a credit card certificate the series certificate to a single investor through a private placement 
interest on the series certificate is earned by the certificate holder on a monthly basis at a fixed interest rate of  and the outstanding principal balance of the certificate is to be repaid in twelve equal monthly installments commencing september and continuing through august on november   gcc trust issued a million variable base class a credit card certificate the series certificate 
upon the expiration of the commitment period for the original series certificate  gcc trust issued two new series certificates on november  in an aggregate principal amount of up to million 
the company borrows against the series certificates on a revolving basis  similar to a revolving line of credit arrangement  and such borrowings bear interest at variable rates equal to the one month libor rate plus  with a minimum rate of 
borrowings against the series certificates are limited to a specified percentage of the outstanding balance of receivables underlying the certificates  and therefore vary depending on seasonal fluctuations in the underlying receivables 
as of february   million was issued and outstanding against the series certificates 
while the newly issued series certificates were issued for million less than was previously issued  due to the seasonal fluctuations in the underlying receivables  that million was only available for borrowings for six to eight weeks during december and january 
accordingly  for a majority of the year the borrowing capacity under the newly issued certificates is essentially equal to that previously available 
the current commitment period for the series certificates expires on october  the series certificates are extendable at the option of gcc trust and the certificate holders through july  in the event the certificates are not extended or replaced with new certificates prior to october   the outstanding principal balances of the certificates will repaid with excess cash flows generated under the program in six equal monthly installments beginning december and continuing through may the amortization period 
the repayment of the outstanding balances of the certificates  which are currently expected to be approximately million as of october   would reduce excess cash flows available to the company for working capital purposes at a rate of approximately million per month over the six month amortization period 
the company expects that the commitment period for the series certificates will be extended  or that new certificates with an equal or larger principal amount will be issued in their place  prior to the end of the commitment period 
however  there can be no guarantee that the certificates will be extended on a timely basis  or at terms and conditions that are not materially different from the current certificates 
the failure to extend the certificates  or any significant delay in the extension of the certificates  could have a material adverse affect on the company s liquidity position 
in addition  the failure to extend the commitment period of the series certificates on a timely basis would result in a cross default under a majority of the company s other debt agreements  including the ge facility 
in the event the commitment period is renewed through july   the principal is to be repaid in twelve equal monthly installments commencing september and continuing through august the securitization program contains restrictions and requirements  including the requirement to maintain certain receivable portfolio performance standards 
the program also contains credit rating downgrade default provisions  which requires securities issued under the program to be rated bbb or higher by a rating agency 
securities issued under the program are currently rated single a by the rating agency 
the inability to maintain compliance with such restrictions and standards or a downgrade in the credit rating  if not waived  could result in the acceleration of principal for the securities currently issued under the program  and any such acceleration  if not refinanced on a timely basis  would significantly reduce excess cash flows generated under the program that ultimately serve as an important source of working capital for the company 
any significant decrease in the level of excess funds generated under the program could have a material adverse affect on the company s liquidity position 
in addition  any default under the securitization program  if not waived  would result in the cross default under a majority of the company s other debt obligations  including the ge facility 
management believes that the company was in compliance with all applicable program requirements as of february  and through the date of this report 
other financings the company has continued efforts to obtain financing from external resources as a means of improving its liquidity position 
in may  the company completed a million mortgage financing of the building acquired in the lamonts transaction 
in fiscal  the company also received a total of million from the sale and leaseback of certain fixtures and equipment 
proceeds from these transactions  totaling million  were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the company s senior revolving credit facility 
on march   the company entered into a million financing with kimco capital corp 
the kimco facility 
the kimco facility is secured by first priority liens on three of the company s owned store properties and with subordinate liens on substantially all other assets of the company securing the ge facility 
proceeds from the kimco facility were used to repay previously existing mortgage loans on two of those properties and one term loan and pay certain fees and costs associated with the transaction 
the remaining million was used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the ge facility 
the kimco facility is co terminus with the ge facility  with monthly principal payments of  plus interest at a fixed rate of per annum  and a balloon payment of million upon maturity on january  on february   the company also completed a million  seven year term loan financing of its corporate aircraft 
the finalization of these two transactions resulted in net cash proceeds totaling approximately million 
combined with the  net proceeds received from the sale of a store lease in january  the company received a total of approximately million of external financings prior to march   and such proceeds were applied towards satisfying the requirements of the previously described initial liquidity event 
store closures in fiscal  the company sold or terminated the leases of six of the original stores acquired from lamonts that were considered to be either under performing or inconsistent with the long term strategy of the company 
the company also terminated the lease of the outsourced distribution center facility operated during the period of july through june net costs associated with closure of those stores and the outsourced distribution center facility totaled  this amount consists of estimated lease termination costs  asset impairment charges including the write off of allocated goodwill and favorable lease rights  severance and other incremental costs associated with the closure of the stores totaling  less  of cash proceeds received as a result of the sale of lease rights  fixtures and equipment 
the company is continuing to operate of the original stores acquired from lamonts 
however  of those stores continue to perform below expectations 
in the event the company is unable to improve the operating performance of those locations  the sale  sublease or closure of those locations may be considered in the future 
in the past  the company has successfully improved the operating results and cash flows of under performing locations through a variety of strategies  including revising the merchandise mix  changing store management  revising marketing strategies  renegotiating lease agreements and reducing operating costs 
however  there can be no assurance that these strategies will improve the operating results and cash flows of those under performing stores  or that the company will be able to sell  sublease or close those stores in the event their performance does not improve 
in addition  the company may incur certain costs and expenses in connection with the sale or closure of those locations that may not be fully offset by sale proceeds  sublease income or favorable lease terminations 
as a result  the company may incur significant store closure costs in the future 
as of the end of fiscal  the company had a reserve for store closure costs totaling  which consisted primarily of estimated future lease obligations for three store locations that were closed in fiscal in the event the company is not successful in selling or subleasing these three locations as soon as management expects  additional reserves for store closure costs may be recorded 
in addition  in the event the company decides to close additional store locations in fiscal  additional reserves for store closure costs  which may be material  may be recorded 
uses of liquidity the company s primary uses of liquidity are for working capital  debt service requirements and capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in fiscal  totaling million  were primarily related to information system enhancements and the renovation and refixturing of certain existing locations 
the company presently has no commitments to open or remodel any stores in fiscal however  the company is committed to complete the implementation of a new merchandise information system  with an expected remaining cash commitment of million in fiscal the company had no outstanding standby or documentary letters of credit as of february  however  as of march   the company had issued a total of million of standby letters of credit and documentary letters of credit totaling  as described in the preceding section titled trade credit and transactions with affiliate  the standby letters of credit  which currently expire by the end of july  were issued to secure credit lines with key factors 
management believes that the likelihood of any draws under the standby letters of credit are remote 
documentary letters of credit are issued in the ordinary course of business to facilitate the purchase of merchandise from overseas suppliers 
the supplier draws against the documentary letter of credit upon delivery of the merchandise 
contractual obligations the following tables set forth certain information concerning the company s debt obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments

see liquidity and capital resources trade credit and transactions with affiliate 
the company had no outstanding documentary letters of credit as of february  however  as of march   the company had issued approximately  of documentary letters of credit with various expiration dates through the end of fiscal cash generated by operations  together with liquidity provided by the ge facility  the securitization program and other financial resources  including without limitation the factors described below  are expected to adequately finance the company s planned cash requirements for fiscal however  the company s actual results may differ from the expectations set forth in the preceding sentence 
the company s liquidity and capital resources may be affected by a number of factors and risks many of which are beyond the control of the company  including but not limited to  the availability of adequate borrowing capacity and the ability to maintain compliance with restrictive debt covenants contained in the company s senior revolving credit facility and its other debt obligations  adequate cash flows generated by operations  the adequacy of factor and trade credit  the ability to extend and modify the terms of the harris letter of credit  the ability to complete the proposed transaction  or alternative financing in the event the proposed transaction is not completed  and the ability to extend the current commitment period for the series certificates by october  subject to the previously described risks and uncertainties relative to the company s sources of liquidity  management currently believes that the described sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet the company s working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for fiscal because the company is already highly leveraged  the ability to obtain additional or alternative sources of financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  new store openings  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes is limited 
if the estimates or assumptions relative to any one of these sources of liquidity are not realized  or if those sources of liquidity become reduced or are significantly delayed beyond expected dates  the company s liquidity position  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
recently issued accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets were issued in june sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  and establishes criteria for recognizing intangible assets separately from goodwill 
under sfas no 
 goodwill will no longer be amortized and will instead be evaluated for impairment at least annually or at any time certain indicators of impairment arise 
all other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
effective the beginning of fiscal the company will test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment using the two step process prescribed by sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of impairment  if any 
the company expects to perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets within six months after the beginning of fiscal  as required by the statement 
any impairment charge resulting from these transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles in the first half of the company has not yet determined what the effect of these tests  if any  will be on the earnings and financial position of the company 
in august  sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  was issued 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the company will adopt sfas no 
effective the beginning of fiscal and does not currently expect that the adoption will have a significant effect on the company s financial position or its results of operations

the company will adopt sfas no 
effective the beginning of fiscal and does not currently expect that the adoption will have a significant effect on the company s financial position or its results of operations 
inflation although inflation has not been a material factor in the company s operations during the past several years  the company has experienced increases in the costs of certain merchandise  salaries  employee benefits and other general and administrative costs  including utilities  health care and workers compensation costs 
the company is generally able to offset these increases by adjusting its selling prices or by modifying its operations 
the company s ability to adjust selling prices is limited by competitive pressures in its market areas 
the company values its merchandise inventories by the retail method using last in  first out lifo cost 
under the lifo method  which is determined by using the department store price indices published by the bureau of labor statistics  the cost of products sold reported in the financial statements approximates current costs and thus reduces the impact of inflation due to increasing costs on reported income 
the valuation of the company s merchandise inventories under the lifo method is currently equal to that as determined by the first in  first out fifo method of accounting 
seasonality the company s business  like that of most retailers  is subject to seasonal influences  with the major portion of net sales  gross profit and operating income realized during the christmas selling months of november and december of each year  and to a lesser extent  during the easter and back to school selling seasons 
the company s results may also vary from quarter to quarter as a result of  among other things  the timing and level of the company s sales promotions  weather  fashion trends and the overall health of the economy  both nationally and in the company s market areas 
working capital requirements also fluctuate during the year  increasing substantially prior to the christmas selling season when the company must carry significantly higher inventory levels 
the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly results of operations for fiscal and in thousands  except per share data 
quarter ended may august november february net sales     gross profit     income loss before income tax expense benefit and extraordinary item     income loss before extraordinary item     extraordinary item net of tax benefit net income loss     net income loss per common share basic and diluted income loss before extraordinary item extraordinary item net income loss weighted average number of common shares outstanding basic     diluted     quarter ended april july october february net sales     gross profit     income loss before income tax expense benefit    net income loss   net income loss per common share basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding basic     diluted     represents an extraordinary loss incurred in connection with the early retirement of the company s previous revolving line of credit 
income loss before income tax expense benefit in the three month periods ended july  and october  include non recurring  pre tax charges for costs incurred in connection with the opening of the stores acquired under the lamonts acquisition totaling  and  respectively 
the total of such costs recognized in fiscal amounted to  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks in the normal course of business due to changes in interest rates on short term borrowings under its senior revolving credit facility 
as of february   the company also had three long term mortgage and term loans bearing variable interest rates 
however  as described more fully in liquidity and capital resources  those three obligations were refinanced in march by a fixed rate borrowing arrangement 
the company does not engage in financial transactions for speculative or trading purposes  nor does the company purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments 
as of february   borrowings subject to a variable interest rate  excluding borrowings refinanced with fixed rate borrowings in march  represented of the company s total outstanding borrowings 
the interest payable on the company s senior revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
an increase of basis points on existing floating rate borrowings a change from the company s weighted average interest rate as of february  would reduce the company s pre tax net income and cash flow by approximately  this basis point increase in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of the company s fixed rate financial instruments
